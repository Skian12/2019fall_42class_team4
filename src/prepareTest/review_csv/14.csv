That means Apple users are stuck with the out-of-the-box configuration. This may pose a problem for some.

The good:
The controls are fairly straight forward. I’ve listened to music and made phone calls. All were great sounding and clear. I’ve had people tell me how great the mic sounds.
They are comfortable. They ship with different sizes of inserts for a good fit.
They are sweat “proof.” I’ve heard this claim before and had other earbuds ruined by sweat. So we’ll see how these hold up in the long run. Airpods are not even sweat resistant. So they wouldn’t be my first choice for workouts.
They can work independently. You don’t need both buds in. They have the same configs right out of the box. So you can use just one if you need and not have to have a different set of controls.

The not-so-good:
You’re stuck with the configuration. The tap controls are easy. Play/pause, skip/reverse, answer/decline, etc. are all just tap sequences. Press and hold activates Siri.
There is no volume control on the buds. That is, unless you have an Android and can change the config. But, since this is a review for iPhone users, there is no volume control on the buds.
The quick-start directions are great for Android users. The case needs to be open and the buds inside it for it to pair. Some may already know this from other types of buds, but these are my first... and I had to Google it.

Are they good? Yes. Would I like them to be more Apple friendly? Yes. I’m going to keep them and just suffer through the volume control thing. The sweat-proofing and sound are more important to me.
You make the call for you. I didn’t see many iPhone reviews or information. So I wanted to share with others who may be looking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I use earbuds for the gym, listen to music and watch video's while working out, so i wanted something that had noise cancelling.. these do that, sorta.. it comes with 3 different size gel tips..i had to put in the large ones, and even then, i have a difficult time getting a seal..so i moisten them before inserting which kinda helps..inserting and removing these are kinda difficult too, since they're 'rounded'..making it hard to grasp with the fingers..once in the ear though, you don't feel them at all! It's quite remarkable..and they stay put very well too. I have had connection issues though even though they are Bluetooth 5.0 and my phone is always in my pocket or no more than 2 feet from me at all times.. i have to go to Bluetooth settings and 'disconnect' them after each use or to reset them while in use, which is a pain in the butt.. the case is smooth and rounded, making it difficult to grasp when in a gym bag.. the battery life is superb though..kudos Samsung for that.. however, there is only one LED to indicate if the earbuds are 'set' in the cases cradle..i'd prefer two LED's, one for each ear bud... how do i know they're both being charged with only one LED? My biggest complain, and something no reviewer addressed (and i watched a ton of video reviews before purchase), is that there is no iOS app for these.. I can't see battery status, change EQ settings, or anything that the Android app can do. Why release a product for one format but not the other? I was assured they are working on one, but couldn't guarantee when it will be available.. I registered them on the Samsung site, indicating my OS in hopes of an alert when the app is available..i was told to keep checking back on the website..Really? For a tech company, that seems pretty prehistoric to me.. without the app, you're get pretty decent sound, although my $19 Anker soundbuds sound better..been a musician my whole life so sound quality is pretty important.. music and quality sound can inspire .. these kinda just are ""Meh""...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They charged $127 and bought these things in Latin America so they could pocket more $$$$$.  When I noticed some slight buzzing noises after weeks of listening to music at high volumes, I tried to register them on Samsung's site but was told the Serial No. was invalid or from another country.

-seamless connectivity with my Note 9 running One UI
-Wireless charging
-Small form factor
-No ""master bud"" trait (where one bud is dominant, and if it dies the other one can't be used)

Not really a con, the sound quality is better than the airpods (first gen at this time), but not quite as rich as the Bose Sound Sports.  But the Bose make me feel like I'm wearing satellite dishes, and I haven't finished playing with my eq setting for the Samsung's yet.

Edit: After about a week of tweaking eq settings and trying different ear-tips and wings, these buds sound just as good as the Bose' if not better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wanted to test the functionality of the headphones at home, work, and in between. I was really surprised at the sound quality. I did not expect such a broad range of sound from such a little device. The paring process was really simple while using the Galaxy S10. My phone recognized the buds as soon as I opened the charging case. Then I opened the Galaxy Wearable app and I was notified of an update for the buds immediately. I must say that the Galaxy buds are comfortable and stay in ear while walking, jogging or running. I didn’t experience the normal ear soreness from extended usage as with some other headphones. While listening to music, the Galaxy buds did a good job of removing background noise. I couldn’t hear much of my surroundings at all. Then, I tested the Ambient Aware feature while at work, and this was really useful. Most people did not recognize that I even had headphones in. The Ambient Aware feature allowed me to hear my surroundings by using the built in mic on the headphones. Portability is also a big plus. Being able to pop the Galaxy buds in and out and having a charging case is a useful tool to have. The charging case is vital at work too. I can get about 5 hours of music listening before having to charge the buds. The coolest feature is having the ability to charge the case and the Galaxy buds. I can get through a whole 9 hour office day having to charge the buds for a few minutes a day. Overall, I recommend the Galaxy Buds for anyone who wants a premium sound from affordable headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Samsung has updated the software twice in the last week. Gets plenty loud without blaring and I love the fact I can use one bud if I want instead of both. I have been wearing one under my headset at work  and it has been comfortable throughout the day. Nobody knows I have it in! 😁

Battery life has been great for me running them at about 70% max volume. All in all I am quite pleased.

They are very comfortable, the sound is good once you use the right settings, and the battery life is great.

One thing I want to say is that I honestly believe many of the complaints about poor volume and Bass are due to operator error by not using the right settings on your phone. Low volume is easily fixed by enabling ""media volume sync"" on your phone. As for the bass, I use the Samsung music app. Once I enabled the Dolby Atmos feature it gave my music much richer sound and deeper bass. So the pro tip is use the equalizer on your phone not the buds. Also using the right sized rubber bud fittings is key to good sound. If these aren't in your ear enough just push them in a bit, the difference in sound quality is huge.

One complaint I do have is the ambient noise feature. It amplifies everything a little too much. A light breeze that would normally not be noticeable will sound like constant wind whistling in your ears with the ambient noise feature on. Its very annoying so I leave it disabled.

Other than that these are great buds. I strongly recommend them for Samsung Galaxy phone owners. I have had ZERO connectivity or dropped connection issues that others reported with non Galaxy phones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've had every Galaxy S phone since the S7, but this is the first pair of Samsung wireless buds I've ever owned. Previously, I'd just buy a $20 pair of bluetooth headphones on Amazon, which would last about a year before needing to be replaced. Those $20 headphones never had half the issues I've had in the past week with these!

My main issue with these buds is that everyday they disconnect and reconnect about 20x. Sometimes they'll say that they're connected and then I go to play music and they'll disconnect and reconnect, but still not play anything. I usually have to turn bluetooth off and on to get them to reconnect properly, and even that sometimes doesn't work, so I'll pull out the charging case, put them in, close the case, and re-open it. Eventually, they'll connect properly, but playing music shouldn't be a 10 step procedure. I have the stupid wearables app, and everything, the buds have a full charge, and they just don't want to connect properly. It's maddening, ding, ding, in your ear every time it decides to drop and reconnect because you tried to play a song.

My next issue is the call quality, I use these at work, where I take at least 10 calls a day. About 4 times now, I've heard myself echoing back at me, which is incredibly distracting when you're trying to have a conversation. It'll just start out of nowhere too, mid call. Other times, the mic is just really bad, people complain that they can't hear me and I have to speak up. It does nothing to cancel out background noise. I've been told to put myself on mute several times during conference calls with these buds (in the same office where my $20 buds had no issues).

Lastly, the wireless charging seems to be pretty spotty. It'll be charging and then all of a sudden lose connection, and need to be re-positioned on the charger.

At this point, I don't know if the issues I described are due to a defect, or issues with the Galaxy S 10 Plus, or what, but it's just unacceptable. A $1000 phone and a $120 pair of buds that can't seem to work right together just goes to show that Samsung doesn't know what they're doing. I'm sending back the buds, and looking into replacing the S10+ with a Google Pixel 3a XL.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've owned both, and would pick these anyday of the week over AirPods. The sound quality is superior, and the aesthetics (personal opinion) are much better. They stay in without issue and can be worn for hours without any discomfort. I would recommend trying the different sized tips included. When testing them, leave them in for at least 10/15 minutes to get a good idea, also shake your head around and make sure they are secure.

Overall, the only complaint I would have is the the battery, but with wireless charging and the ability of the Galaxy S10+ to PowerShare, that's no problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Have had some time to get familiar with all the features and functions. I use them every day at work, GYM and at home. The adaptive dual microphone feature is great at work, if I have someone talk to me while I’m listing to music, or if my desk phone rings I can still hear it. The battery has lasted me roughly 5 hours of straight usage, mixed talk, and music. The charging case will re-charge them, but since I remove them here and there and dock them the battery can last closer to the advertised 10-11hours. Plus owning a Samsung S10+ with reverse charging I can give them a boost of power while on the go if necessary. These have to be some of the best sounding headphones I have ever owned, I used to think my AKG over the hear headset was the best, but they are bulky and not work, or GYM friendly. The should quality when wearing both is immersive, and can make you forget you're in a loud office or loud GYM. Bass and Treble are balanced and offer great voice and music capability.  Often use them after work at the GYM, and having them be sweat resistant is great! Plus, they don’t fall out or feel obtrusive in my hear during running or cardio. My old AKG wires headphones would prevent me from enjoying my work out with cords to adjust. Using them is simple enough, just make sure to select the right size earpiece, I found the default one it ships with fits perfectly. But there are optional S, L in the box. Controlling the Buds is done with your finger via touch, you can take calls, end them, change tracks, turn up or down the volume. And if you remove them it will pause the music which is great so you don’t ever miss a beat. To pair them to my S10, all you have to do is open the case, and the Phone UI will detect them and display the Galaxy Buds on screen with name, and battery level. So, pairing them takes but a few seconds. I was able to also use them on my iPhone Xr, different setup process, but simple none the less. Fist make sure they are not currently synced to Android by turning off Bluetooth on Android device, the open the clamshell case and have iOS search for Bluetooth devices, it will show up as Galaxy Buds (####). Select the corresponding Buds and pair. Once paired they will work like any other Bluetooth headset for iOS. The only downside to iOS is that firmware updates will not work, you will need to re-sync them to Android via the Gear App for them to check and keep to up to date. Overall these earbuds are some of the best I have ever owned, and you will not be disappointed, they come in Black, White and Yellow to match any personality and mood.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I waited a while before reviewing this product just to see if they would last and they have. Very satisfied. I bought them to cancel out the absolutely terrible music my work plays over the speakers. These buds can be very loud too. I don't have the volume turned up at all, but you could play music very loudly if you wanted (not recommended from me though). They fit nicely into my ears and don't fall out at all. They are comfortable and don't have any weird protrusions that make them uncomfortable to wear. The buttons are easy to click. I would recommend getting a small plastic sandwich bag to put the case in for carrying it around in your pocket to prevent dust from getting into the charge port though. It's a simple and non-intrusive way to keep it clean. I had to dig dust and lint out of my phone charge port eventually because of this problem, so it does happen eventually.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'll start off with the positives. The battery life is great, lasting the whole work day and well into the night on a single charge (with occasionally putting them in the case to charge during meetings). They're relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The case is decent quality and offers the option of wireless charging and USB-C charging.

Now on to the bad I've experienced. When walking with my phone in my pocket (S8), listening to Spotify, the music constantly cuts out, occasionally echos, and gets distorted. I thought it might have been a bad data connection so I tried playing some music that I had stored on my phone, but experienced the same results. I was hoping to use this when working out, going for a run, etc., but if I can't even walk down the street without connectivity issues, I can only imagine what vigorous work would do to it.

The case construction itself leaves much to be desired. It's made out of a cheap plastic and I could see the lid easily breaking off if my three year old gets ahold of it.

Bottom line: The Galaxy Buds are not for everyone. I would recommend them to those who are relatively staionary and don't have little kids. If you live any kind of active lifestyle, you should stay away until they update the issues they're currently having.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'll only leave a negative review if I feel that people should know about a serious issue with a product. Especially a product over $100.

These Galaxy Buds are cool except for a few things that I could just not accept. Having owned multiple Bluetooth headsets of different makes and models I have to say that this has been my least favorite. I've owned 2 different LG headsets, a Bose headset and these.

- These were uncomfortable in my ears, even after changing to the smaller size of the rubber fittings.

- The sound quality of music and podcasts by no means impressed me (not that it was bad, just wasn't great). The sound at max volume is quite low out of the box. This can be fixed though (after using Google to find the solution) by downloading the Galaxy Wearable app to increase the volume, which is a one and done resolution.

- MOST IMPORTANTLY, the phone call quality is horrible. I called several people while wearing these to find out that people could barely hear me at all. This could be because the microphones (which are on both buds) are all the way back by your ear. But it's 2019 so I wouldn't think this should be an issue. After searching on Google to find a solution I just came across pages and pages of Samsung's community forums of people searching for the same answers I was with no solutions.

I know Samsung is a good brand, I expected better.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

If you use these for the office and gym like me they are a good value. If you have an iPhone it likely won't work as well without the app so I wouldn't recommend these for Apple devices (I have a samsung personal phone and an apple work phone).

I've most recently tried out the Jabra Elite Active 65t headphones. They we pretty good and actually great when it came to call quality. However, they could never quite fit comfortably in my ear and so I couldn't use them for more than 10 minutes at a time without taking them out because my ear started hurting. I heard bad things about call quality and audio quality with the Galaxy Buds. I haven't used them for calling yet but compared to other headphones, they don't have the array of microphones so I can see why these would not be best suited for calls. This isn't an issue for me as I don't call a ton throughout the day. The audio quality is really similar to Jabras and perfect for casual listeners when used with a larger earbud tip. I thought this would be a bad compromise and hurt my ears for better sound quality but haven't had any comfort issues. These are the lightest while being the most secure headphones I've had. Definitely the best Bluetooth headphones I've bought yet and I have only had them a day. I have a Galaxy Note 9 so the app for these is a must.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Dont hesitate to buy em!","July 14, 2019","After leaving the iPhone fan group and switching to a new Samsung S10+, I was initially very skeptical as to the quality of these buds.

I should have never been worried! These are amazing! The case which holds the buds is very sleek and allows for wired or wireless charging. In addition, the buds have great battery life and the case provides even more juice on the go. What I truly like about these more than the typical apple airpods and other style buds is that they fit into your ear very nicely and they have an app that allows you to customize your sound settings for the type of music you normally listen to. They also have an ambient sound feature that allows you to hear people talking to you etc while you have them in your ears. It's a great feature!

If you're on the fence about getting these I would say just get them! They are worth the price and they definitely have comparable sound to Beats!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I believe it was due to a few software updates for the driver's. I'm not sure but they work great now. I'm glad I did rush to return them. I have using them and sound quality is great.

Update 5/8/2019, Day 2: I did some trouble shooting. Reset my Earbuds and reinstalled app. I found if you continuously tap on the Device Name, which you will find if you click on About Earbuds in the Wearables app, you can test the headphones to see if they are functioning properly. I placed the headphones on my phone and started test. Test came out as Passing on all data. Now when you place the Earbuds in your ear it will state that the Proximity L and Proximity R FAIL which happens only when they are in your ear and means you need to take them off to get an accurate test. So far so good. Will possibly give 5 stars and may not return after all. Glad I tried trouble shooting.

Day 1: Just received the Galaxy Buds today. I love Samsung products. Usually very trusting of them. Sadly I got a defective pair. Very disappointing. The left earbud makes no indication of being placed in ear. I believe it's a sensor defect. The right earbud does make a sound when placed in ear. The app also shows me that ambient sound is not possible since both are not in my ear when they definitely are. I looked at both to make sure examine differences and their seems to be no visual differences. Looks like the sensor is defective one the left ear for my pair. Hopefully can receive a different pair that's not totally defective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

For no apparent reason it will cut out randomly until docked in its case. Just now one of the buds began emitting a high pitched tone until docked for a minute... it seems to be degrading.

On top of that, the package I was sent was NOT as advertized. They sent me the case, buds, and a charger in a plastic bag. No differently-sized rubber bits (though Amazon sent me some for free since Samsung refused) and no manual. Plus the bag had a sticker claiming the device was new but it was a little dirty so I doubt that. I paid an extra like $40 for new not refurbished, so, I recommend not doing the same. They'll send you a refurbished device anyway.

As earbuds they're great. Occasionally redocking them is annoying but all bluetooth earbuds need to be recharged every several hours anyway so they work out to not be especially bad. But the false advertizing, hassle to get the correct pieces, degrading reliability, and high cost together have me giving this 2 stars. There are other brands so go for them instead.

Pros
 - very discreet earbuds. I like how they don't stick out of your ears like the Air Pods for example.

- If you have a Samsung phone, there is an App where you can adjust the sound profile. Though I personally didn't hear a huge difference, you can also adjust the ambient noise where it allows you to hear the environment around you. This was a huge plus for me, and it works very well.

- the travel case is small, and discreet as well. Doesn't leave a big buldge in your pocket or anything. I never found myself running out of battery on my earbuds on any day. I can wear my earbuds up to 3 hours at a time at %30-50 volume.

- sound quality is above average. at this price point, I didn't have Godly like expectations where I would be getting Sennheiser True Wireless like sound stage. Those earbuds cost more than double, so let's be realistic here people.

-you CAN wear one earbud at a time if you would like, regardless if it's the left or right earbud. Doesn't matter. I didn't realize how much this mattered to me until I used it for a longer period of time. In comparison, the Jabra Elite can only wear one earbud if it's the RIGHT earbud. The left cannot play music alone. That was a huge deal breaker for me, as for you.. you can decide if that matters. When you take out the earbud when wearing both, music does not pause on the other one you're wearing it and vice versa. When you're just wearing one earbud and decide to put in the second one, music continues playing and it's a smooth transition.

- can be charged wirelessly, on a s10/s10+. I didn't use this feature much, but it's cool knowing they it's there. It charges much slower on your phone vs a direct wired connection

Cons:

- this is not a deal breaker for me, but it may be for you. It's not water resistant. I think it can only take an x amount of sweat, but you don't wanna get these drenched in water. These are not advertised as workout headphones so I'm personally completely fine with it. I have a separate earbuds for that scenario.

-though the case is small, everytime I dropped it my earbuds always fly out of the case. I wish it didn't open that easily with drops. So don't drop your earbuds in the case

- to my surprise, I haven't used it much for phone calls. But from what I heard from other YouTube reviewers, they say call quality is terrible in noisy environments. Callers have a hard time hearing you, so try to be in a quiet environment if possible.

- the earbuds have gestures to pause/skip tracks, answer and ignore calls. I used mine primarily for music. one thing I noticed, which might POSSIBLY be a user error on my end.. but every now and then the Buds don't register my touches. Example. When I double tap to skip track, sometimes it registers only 1 tap and the song pauses. Minor annoyance, but something to be aware of. I think you have to hit the earbuds perfectly rather than just the edge of your finger. another thing I noticed is if you're listening to music and you skip a few tracks on your music Playlist, each time you hit double tap I feel like the earbuds are getting pushed deeper and deeper into my ear canal, and it's discomforting. I wish in the future maybe they do a swipe feature as a gesture to skip and go back to a track rather than the double/triple tap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

This is from someone who has an iPhone, so maybe the app makes all the difference, in which case, Samsung is missing out on a huge chunk of their potential market by not having an iOS app.

First of all — the earbuds are heavy. This is going to happen, since unlike wired earbuds, they have to have the battery, etc. I was able to mostly forget about them, but after a while my ears began to ache. They provide you with alternative fins and buds, and I swapped through all of them trying to find a comfortable fit. I thought I had, and went to compare to my current (5€) earbuds — nope. The difference is stark and uncomfortable.

The sounds were flat at best, muffled at worst. I played around with the Spotify EQ for over two hours trying to get something that resembled reasonable sound. This is apparently where the app shines through, well. I’m not an audiophile by any means. I listen to music/podcasts 9 hours of my day, however, and this just doesn’t cut it. I

They are just fantastic. They replaced my Jabra Elite 65t's for a handful of reasons I will explain below.

1. They are smaller and lighter: Maaaaan they are so much smaller and lighter. The Jabra's are like little onion bulbs in my ear. Now don't get me wrong, the Jabra's fit my ears wonderfully, they get great points for ergonomics, but the Jabra's are just too heavy, and they are on the large side. They don't fit small persons ears (i've tested it on friends and family with small ears and they are a no.) These Galaxy Buds on the other hand, are suuuper lightweight, and their ""pyramid"" shape is very ergonomic to the ear (at least mine, YMMV as always!) The other thing about the Jabra's are that one earbud is sliiiiightly heavier than the other, and man oh man, I could feel it all the time. It always felt like the heavier earbud was pulling on itself. The Galaxy Buds do not suffer from that issue, as they both are feather light and comfy AF.

2. Independent usage and control versatility: The earbuds controls are on both sides, and you can use EITHER earbud by itself. This is such a damn problem with 99% of earbuds out there. Other than some obscure Chinese OEM that may have that feature (which are mostly garbage), the only mainstream brand earbuds that share this same feature are the Apple Airpods. Being able to use either earbud by itself is super important to me. Be it walking around and being aware of my surroundings, or having one in while working. There are many situations where I use just one bud, and having the option of either side is wonderful. The added thing that many don't think of is that if you are going to be listening for a particularly long time (say to an audiobook/podcast all day long) then you can get continuous usage until you use up all the juice in the charging case. If you have one in and it gets low, just swap it out and let the dead one charge. You can't do that with all the earbuds that have a ""master/slave"" configuration where one bud is dependent on the other bud. Having the same controls on both sides (minus the tap-hold if you choose to use it for volume) is equally important in that regard, so you don't have to pull out your phone or use a smartwatch to do functions like pause and next and previous. ALL TRUE WIRELESS EARBUDS SHOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY.

3. Modern charging standards: USB C and Qi charging. Enough said. Everything is going C or Qi, so thank you Samsung for making it modern. The less cables I have to carry and/or buy, the better. Micro USB was a standard, but it's time has passed, and it needs to die gracefully. Don't even get me started on that one company's proprietary cables that they force down peoples throats and wallets...

4. Svelte charging case, ""pocket-ergonomic"": the only other earbuds worth a piss on the market that have a svelte and small charging case are (of course) the Apple AIrPods. They are still the king on the pocket-able size and shape of their product. Samsung is damn close though with the Galaxy Buds. They are very svelte, and their feeling in the pocket is just as good (as in, you hardly notice they are there) as the AirPods. Yes, some other earbud cases are ""squatter"" and some are ""skinnier"" but the other's don't get the shape right, so they always end up feeling like a fat stone in your pocket. The Galaxy Buds case melts into your leg and you don't even notice it's there (unless maybe your partial to skinny jeans. My experience is with standard jeans and slacks)

All in all, these hit all the sweet spots for price, style (no more toothbrushes thanks,) function, ergonomics, sound quality (better than AirPods, about on par with Jabra's. Don't expect B&O sound quality) and features. I don't think there is a better set of true wireless earbuds under $200. And to be honest, the concessions that some of the over $200 ones make you suffer is a dealbreaker.

If you want great wireless buds, these are the ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Day 30: ?","March 31, 2019","Will do an update on day 30 and whether ive decided that i want to keep them or not.

Day 1 of using these wireless buds.
These are my first pair of truly wireless headphones. $130 is not little for me so I have watched every video review and read every article out there.  I was very skeptical because of the bad microphone reviews everybody gave it, as my MAIN USE for it is phone calls. Did multiple calls through out the day with no problems with sound or the other party not hearing me. Have had some issues with connecting them to my laptop and the left earbud stopped working for a while, but i think that was related to the case running out of battery cuz i connected and started using them right out the box didnt plug them in at all. There was weird static in the buds while connected to the laptop, none of that while connected to the phone tho. So that might be from my laptop idk. Again ive had these for only one day so far.
Initial impression is so far so good. Very impressive noise cancellation and GOOD sound quality. Very light in the ear, can wear them for extended amount of time with no fatigue. Glad they had replacement ""wings"" as what comes on by default didnt sit good with my ear so those come handy. Case is very small and easy to carry around. Stay posted for update in a month.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Returned then about 30 days later. On my second pair and am ready to return them after only a week. Initial impression was they are awesome, music sound quality was great. Good for in my ear, used them all the time, in my yard while gardening. As earbuds and blue tooth device for work while traveling. The issue is when using them as a Bluetooth device for phone calls people in the other end hear a loud metallic clacking noise and can barely hear me. With out the ability to use them for phone calls these amount to a $130 paper weight, absolutely useless. Very disappointed.

First, the ambient noise on the left earpiece wasn't working. Then the left earpiece started cutting out audio constantly. Afterwards, after about 20 minutes, the video and audio become out of sync and audio is lagging behind the video slightly. NOW ON THE THIRD DAY the audio of both earbuds are out of sync with each other and the left piece is lagging behind the right making an annoying echo effect.

As a galaxy s10e user I have no choice this is the Best option but at a cost. Battery life is meh gets you through the day, sound quality is flat and bass is poor. The tap features are a hit or miss mostly with the triple tap to go back to the previous track, if you press it to fast it will skip or pause, if you tap to slow it will skip or pause you would have to be a human metronome to get it right. The biggest disappointment is the microphone. ABSOLUTE TRASH!! your voice is inaudible over the phone and if you want hear your surroundings just take the earbuds off, you wont regret going the extra step that you didn't have to do if it was better. I also have the airpods 2 and I have done the comparison, sound quality the airpods win with a good balance of highs, mids and and acceptable standard of bass but just with ambient sound permanently on because of its design. The case has wireless charging and the pill design makes it compact and clean, opening the case requires 2 hands, not a joke. When closing it feels like a rusted door you have to apply some pressure and it makes a satisfying click imitating the airpods that do this with ease.

Overall just get these for convenience of wireless earbuds. Sound is ok so sure why not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Say goodbye to the wire-tangled life.","May 5, 2019","First and foremost, I'm a dedicated runner, getting in between 8-10 miles each day, 5 days  a week, at 9 mph constantly- not including the distances traveled while walking at work or running errands. The remaining 2 days are for limited hit-cardio, but even then, I'll squeeze 3 miles at an uncomfortable pace of 10.5 for that burn. These buds STAY INSIDE YOUR EARS no matter how much you move around. That doesn't mean go crazy and start headbanging, but their very resistant to high intensity workouts. Just be conscious of them. Both are incredibly light and there are different ear tips for the buds should they not fit well. Different topic- but ..sometimes your phone/smartwatch, will register the run, other times it'll register it as just walking...either which way you're still getting a wire-free experience.

Ambient sound can be a tad irritating, and the touch controls MIGHT not respond accurately, but this is purely situational.
Their comfortable, fit securely, and are easy to use. controlling them through the Samsung gear app is also convenient.
It allows you to check the charge level of each ear bud, the connectivity status, control the notifications preference for what apps can be controlled via touch on the buds, touch-pad preference, etc.
So overall usage is wonderful, UX from feedback was definitely taken into account, and the UI with simple to remember taps to skip a song, a few songs, a whole track, answer and decline calls based on what bud is tapped, and more is incorporated into these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

That said, there are better then average sounding true wireless bud.  They have are highly comfortable if you get the fin, tip setting perfect. Battery life is amazing for the size.  I purchased blacks ones on Amazon and lost the charging case so elsewhere I purchased the Yellow.  As you can see I blended the colors of each but which will help me not lose the black ones.  I am overall very happy and find myself reaching for these and SoundPeats almost exclusively despite the fact that I own about 10 pairs of true wireless.  I downgraded my previous 5 star radio for one epic flaw. It is on Amazon purchased black pair and elsewhere online yellow pair.  They are horrible for using on the phone which is a huge inconvenience. Everytime I answerna call or call out, the person can hardly heard me. Somensaid it sounded like I was in a storm..  Samsung goes as far as saying they are great for calls!; Though I don't use my airpods and dispute the fact they they are still me go to buds, they are NOT better then airpods because with airpods people don't even know you are using them on a call?

The Bluetooth connection was spotty and would cut out if I bent over, it was bad. HOWEVER, it turns out that it was just my set. I called Samsung, since they were still under warranty, and they sent me a new pair, perfectly functioning. They have, in my opinion, amazing battery life. I have only ever ran them all the way down once, and they last a day, guarantee for me.  That 6 hour battery life is legit. The call quality is pretty good. I've never had someone not understand me while using them for calls, and I have used them both inside and outside. As for fit, they do take a little getting used to. But if you do manage to find the right combo of wings and tips, then they seal your ear fairly well. I usually can't understand people talking to me if music is playing, and it is definitely muffle when there isn't music playing. The environmental awareness feature is ok, it really does just make stuff sound tinny, but for what it is intended for, it works. The touch controls are decent; sometimes if I don't tap enough towards the center of the touch pad, it won't read, but it is responsive once you get the hang of it. The wireless charging is absolutely ingenious. I have an ikea desk lamp with a wireless charger, and I just throw them on overnight, and that's that. There is a USB-C if that suits your fancy too. Finally, the sound quality. I think they are pretty good. I am no audiophile, so as long as you aren't OBSESSED with the sound quality, they will do just fine. They do have bass, contrary to popular belief, though it will not be bass you FEEL. What I mean is, you won't feel the bass as well as hear it, like with a sub-woofer or something. The ""equalizer"" in the wearable app does have a ""dynamic"" setting that provides the best balance in my opinion; the ""bass boost"" just lowers mids and trebles, so it isn't really great. Overall, they are an excellent set of headphones that I take literally anywhere, especially since they are so dang compact.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have fallen asleep wearing them. They charge pretty well too! They are so small as well in their case.

I love the fact that you can use only one at a time and they are intelligent enough to know that you have taken one out

Only one problem.

ABSOLUTELY NOT WATER OR DUST PROOF AT ALL

if you sweat, you better take them out and clean them.
They released them a little too quickly or something. They are the absolute best for all but wearing them in the rain, doing workout, or in the shower. They are so very invisible once they have been in your ears that you forget to remove them in the shower.

I suppose that I have to make some compromises. when I need to be waterproof I can use my other earphones. The other earphones have a wire between them. Kinda silly that the galaxy gears are much more waterproof and old, but they cost a LOT more money than these.
They are very small in your pocket. Use them for anything you want unless you sweat a lot. No swimming or bathing. I will use them daily in my work! I do not get wet in any way at all.

Tldr, they are extremely amazing! Don't get them wet. Bass is good enough. The apps equalizer is good.

Cool Concept","May 10, 2019","The Samsung Galaxy Buds are a great set of ear buds. They offer solid sound while keeping them small and compact. They charge in a wonderful little black case. The case also charges wireless which works great with the Samsung wireless charger I use on my desk already. You can use one at a time or both. So far I've tried them listening to music and placing some phone calls, both sound great and clear. I tried the music and the calls using one ear bud and both. The ear buds over all are pretty comfortable in the ear and aren't terribly noticeable. The first time i used them i thought the volume was very quite, even with my phone volume completely turned up. I found these have an internal volume and just needed to be turned up. There is a nice app you can use to configure the buds to how you want them. I configured the touch button on the ear bud to adjust volume and simply just turned it up. The touch button can be used to play/pause music, answer/hang up phone calls, and skip and go back on music tracks, all in addition to the volume control i mentioned above. The pair with the phone was very simply. All i did was open up the app and tell it I had some ear buds. I can't wait to try these at different opportunities coming up this summer.

As with many other users on Samsung forum, sound quality is good locally, but the other person on a call hears pops/static/garbage. (Users report this problem remains even after reset & exchange for new pair!)

As a user of AirPods, Nuheara IQBuds, and Sony WH-1000XM3s, I am now using these as my daily drivers with good sound on “Dynamic” mode in the Equalizer within the Galaxy Wearable app. Sound quality isn't as good as my WH-1000XM3s, but these are certainly more discreet and appropriate for one-bud driving and work.

- Initially upon pairing with my Note 9 and testing with my favorite testing song (you have one, right?) the volume was simply too low. I tried everything but couldn't get it to go to more than maybe 50% volume even though the system said they were maxed.
LOW VOLUME FIX: Had to go into Android “developer settings,” check “Disable Absolute Volume” and reboot… only then was the volume fixed. Pairing with iPad Pro 11 and iPhone X had no volume issues and good sound.

- Good overall balance between price and quality.  On the Dynamic setting, sound is similar to Apple airPods.  AirPods can sound artificially “processed,” which is not the case in the Galaxy Buds.

- Although these aren't actively noise blocking, the design blocks enough that people will have to shout for you to hear them.  For the sound blocking to be effective (and to have good bass) you must rotate the buds after you place the tip in your ear to put them in the correct position in the ear canal.  Rotate counter-clockwise for the optimal fit.

- We tested call quality and microphone quality by calling my teenage daughter's phone. She said my airPods sounded like I was talking through a bag, and Galaxy Buds sounded clear. Good enough!!

- We expected ambient sound control similar to Sony WH-1000 series or Nuheara IQBuds, but Galaxy Buds controls were primitive and less effective by comparison.  Ambient sounds coming in are mixed in but sound tinny… not a big issue for me, but the Sony WH-1000Mx3 win the prize here with ambient sounds mixed in that sound natural with “focus on voice” settings that actually work, unlike the same setting for these Galaxy Buds, which seemed to have very little effect.

- Ambient sound is only needed when both earbuds are in, so the option is greyed out if only one is in.  [NOW FIXED: There's a software issue with ambient sound where if you only use one bud after having both in, ambient sound controls cannot be turned back on even if you then place both in your ears.]

- Volume control can be configured with long-press on the left (volume down) and long-press on the right (volume up).  If you only use one bud at a time, this doesn’t work of course. Interestingly, volume appears to be independent of the Android's media volume setting (i.e., you could max media volume on your phone and then turn it up even louder with the earbuds)

- Battery life is good… can easily get full day alternating left/right, and battery percentage shown in Galaxy Wearable app is often visible.  You cannot see the case’s charge except in 1/3 increments.  When the case is unplugged, open the case and then close it again.  The front LED will show green, yellow, and red for rough charge left in the case.  Using both earbuds all day should theoretically be possible since there should be 2+ charges in the case, providing 18 hours of play (17 hours in my tests) before everything dies. Like the Nuheara IQBuds, you can't turn things “off” when charging in the case, so eventually things will likely run out even if you're not using them.  Definitely use a higher amp base charger to charge the case quickly.

- Size is easily as good as airPods for the case slipping into a pants pocket. However, the slick non-textured case surface means it could slip out of my pocket while seated or lying down.

- Can locate a lost bud though Galaxy Wearable app, but just as with iOS and airPods, you cannot locate the base (which you'll recall likes to fall out of pocket due to its slippery surface)

- The Galaxy Buds reads notifications?  Yay! Right? We expected functionality similar to free Android app “Out Loud” by hillman apps, which can read your text messages or Facebook messages or other notifications out loud. Sadly, the Galaxy Wearable provided only very basic functionality, only reading app name and no details.  (So instead of reading the full text message, it says only “Messenger.”) Not very useful.

- Overall… I've been waiting for someone to come along with something better than the Apple airPods, and I've always been disappointed that no one could beat the airPods -- until now. I'm now using these every day. Many of the issues above can be resolved with firmware/software updates, so I'm more than pleased with the capabilities and quality in this (early but related to consumer) state.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They block noise very well which is a pro for workouts and noisy offices but a con for situational awareness. Battery life is amazing.

The case is super slick, like fall out of your pocket slick.

Sound quality is.... Interesting.... If you jam the things in your ears, like uncomfortably so, then they sound good. If you try to let them hang out a bit so they are more comfortable and you can hear around you better, then the sound quality drops significantly. Bass is the most affected, but honestly the pros far outweigh the cons.

I have a lot of bluetooth headsets and these are the best on balance. However I'd like to stress that if you are going to wear them long term, like all day at work, then airpods are much better. After a few hours with these in they start to really hurt my ears.

I wish they'd have a smaller eartip than what's included like the old Moto Hint from back in the day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

There is an echo that happens as well normally when using them when talking on the phone. Paired with a Galaxy S10+. I was willing to overlook the disconnecting. Even the echo as it normally stops after 15 to 30 seconds. But losing sound in one side is just bad. I could still hear the chime if I pushed the touchpad and the earbud was connected as it could still control the music. It would just stop playing the music out of one earbud. I would not reccomend unless you plan on using one earbud at a time. Then it might be ok although you will lose the ambient sound feature.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Treble- 10
Bass - 7.8 [not surprised but they are good thou, not perfect but they are buds so maybe it's perfect based on price and technological limitations]
Mids/Vocals - 9 [damn right]

So here's some quick pros n cons while i'm here;

Pros:
- easy to pair and the App is very intuitive
- the carrying case is perfectly sized and if you been reading online or watching videos you know the S10 line can charge it via the case wirelessly and it uses USB C!!! lol so nice
- Like i mentioned before the sound is pretty good, i paid 120bucks and i'm not mad, i spent way more for less quality in the past.

Cons - sound quality for all i know could be better, i just based it as good in comparison to all the other non popular buds out there.
- it works seamlessly with Samsung devices but not with apple, little glitches here and there but nothing major. just shows either apple don't like buds or samsung purposely made them to glitch with apple.... both parties suck IMO....

that's all for now [05/24/2019] i'll update if something happens or i discover something. as for now, they get my vote of approval [for droid users anyways] apple users stick to your Airpods, why even try it when it will glitch from time to time more often than not?

For those complaining about the low volume it can be configured via the application. Pairing and configuration was relatively straight forward. The touch buttons will take a while to get used to them. The lack of actual buttons if a drawback. Phone calls are loud and clear on both sides of the line.

I am so surprised with these headphones. I mainly bought these to do yard work and was unsure if they would stay in my ears.

Downside, they can been a little uncomfortable after a while but I also haven't tried to use any of the different ear pieces that came in the box. The sound quality is pretty good, if you are looking for a headphone with a lot of low end bass, these are not your headphones. They have a nice dynamic sound but I wish they had a little more bass to them. I also don't understand or used the ambient sound feature it made everything just sound like static.

Paired with my Galaxy S10, they sounded good (though not Bose quality, which I'm a bit biased towards anyway), they connected easily, and felt comfortable. It was great having no wires to worry about at all. However, this whole experience is CRIPPLED by the fact that these buds suck on any other device that's not made by Samsung. I often use my home computer and work computer to listen to music, videos, etc. And these headphones sound TERRIBLE on those devices, both Windows computers. Sure, I can download an equalizer to improve this, but I shouldn't have to. And there's no official Samsung Windows app either, so I can't adjust anything that I would be able to adjust on my phone. They could at least make it so that the headphones remember the settings from your phone. My previous Bose Soundsport Wireless sounded the same on every device, no downloading or adjusting the equalizer or anything. Now, if you just use these with your Galaxy and no other device, they're fine. But this limited functionality is just lame, and it's a shame that Airpods work and sound better on other devices compared to these, right out of the box. Really disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I owned a pair of Jabra elite 65t's and so I'm kinda compairing. Samsung's sound is pretty good, I been listening for the last 5 hours at a somewhat elevated volume. The left one lasted longer at 25% right one 15%. The signal kinda got fuzzy once or twice but quickly corrected itself. I had to change the eartip and piece that fits into my ear to the larger one that made the sound much better. I don't like the touch pad on the earbuds as it makes it too easy to pause the music accidentally. Downloaded the app for earbuds from Google play that helps. Oh, and when you turn it up loud the treble seems just a bit too high the music is not even. It has good bass to me. But honestly Jabra elite are awesome the only issue was they just slightly too big for my ear and after awhile uncomfortable but the sound is amazing even without the eq.

No ear fatigue what so ever and comes with 3 sets of tips for the best possible fit. For something this small, I didn't expect the sound quality to be that great, however its the opposite. Audio quality is one of the best in its category and features a built in equalizer to customization. I can hear the highs and lows very well even when on a call in a noisy environment. Wireless charging case is a great added feature even a quick 10 mins of charging gives me about 40 mins of musics. If you have a Samsung Galaxy S10 variants, you can use the PowerShare feature to charge the case. Love the Find My Earbuds feature which send out an audible sound to direct you to it location(they do want you to find them). Ambient sound to hear your surrounding.

Very pocket-able, last all day, great sound for their size and weight, touch controls, pass trhu mode (although imperfect) all work excellent. I waited way too long to get these. If you are getting a new phone, do not buy! I heard a lot of carriers give these out with a galaxy phone purchase.
I use these for just about everything, and the anti lag integration on galaxy phones makes videos enjoyable (did not work on my 2017 MBP)
I came from bose earbuds and quiet comforts, and these bridged the gap to the sealed-in-ear style.

After charging the Buds completely and ensuring all updates have been installed,  no one could hear me if there was the slightest outside noise (a oscillating room fan, on low setting 10 feet away, prevented people from hearing me) and if I was in a completely silent room,  I sounded muffled to everyone.

And with the Galaxy Buds long tap right/left controls to raise/lower the volumes are all but non-functional. The problem also occurs when synced to my Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop OS. Installing the Galaxy Plugins didn't help either.
I'm almost positive that the Buds would have had excellent sound with the Nano and I would have decided to keep them for that reason alone.

Easy to go running with and to sleep with. The sound quality isnt bad but it isnt anything special. Its like the akg ones in the Samsung s9+ package. They are a little bulky but you can still sleep comfortably with some maneuvering.

The case is very nice and it charges them wirelessly. All you have to do is charge them inside the case once in a while. The battery life is pretty good, I use them pretty much everyday for exercising and before sleeping.

They are small and easy to fit in your pocket. Happy to not have to deal with tangled wires anymore in my pocket which makes it worth it. Also I don't have to deal with wires when I'm exercising.

They connect to your Samsung s9 almost instantly when you take them out of the case and put them in your ears. The single tap and double tap feature is very useful too. The noise cancellation is something I dont really need or use often. I like loud music when I'm exercising and I put the volume up to 80% of the max volume and that cancels my loud footsteps and breathing. I dont think I have noise cancellation on.

I am very familiar with Samsung products, and was excited about these after reading the upgrades over previous versions.

Pros:
Compact, lightweight, very comfortable. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. I even wear them while running and they do not move.
Sound quality is good. Noise canceling is decent considering that it is only passive. I spend a lot of time on planes and they work well I blocking background noises.

Cons:
Battery life and charging. Will only get about 3 hours of continuous use. A pain if you spend long periods of time on a plane. Also, charging is inconsistent across the buds. I have had the left bud not charge at all several times.

My biggest issue with these buds has been call quality. They are absolutely horrendous!  The microphone muffled your voice, all the while picking up every little sound around you. I have found improved performance indoors, but absolutely useless outdoors and in noisy environments like airports. Totally defeats the purpose of why I bough them for.

If you are looking for good buds for listening to your favorite tunes, then these are a good choice.

I recently bought these wireless earphones and kinda clueless why a lot of people give these earphones a good review. First and foremost the design is great. I love how they don't stick out like Q tips on your ears, and the charging design cool. Here's the bad part.

As I used them when walking to school or work during phone calls it tends to lose a lot of connectivity with both pods in my ear. It sounds like the ear phones are losing signal. Second, when using one pod. Prior who I am calling tell me that they can't hear me at all. Not sure why it keeps doing that. It's legit updated about three times since u got them but these earphones are bad quality. Being Samsung brand and akg I think I get better results buy another pair of airpods.

Lastly forgot to mention that the earphones case smell like burn plastic or of the box. Might be the issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After a month the right earbud lost 80% volume. Look it up its an issue. I added the app, updated firmware, did everything on the forums and youtube to correct the right earbud. Let the wife have at it on her Iphone, my Pixel 3, everything thrown at them.

So instead of just returning them we went to Samsung, sent in for warranty instead of Amazon and now they have not sent any replacement for several weeks. I got one month of use. I sent them in to Samsung for warranty and now I guess i have to fight for the replacement set??? I have no earbuds working or not now.

 I would say its been a horrible experience with both the product and the manufacturer, don't buy Samsung Buds.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The ambient noise feature is a must for me.  Got these delivered and installed the app to test them out aaaand.....the ambient sound feature didn't work. The proximity sensor in the left bud doesn't work so it thinks that only one bud is in and the ambient feature is disabled unless both buds are in your ears.  Huge deal breaker. I've placed an order for a replacement and will update the review accordingly, but after a quick Google search it looks like this is an extremely common problem with no solution.

Sound quality is great and they are very comfortable so far.

UPDATE:  Got the second pair and the proximity sensor works on this pair.  However, the ambient sound feature leaves much to be desired.

Kim","Works great indoors or inches from your head","April 26, 2019","So I bought a pair of galaxy buds off Amazon after reading about them online. Nice design, small and simple. That's where the good ended for me. The Galaxy Buds worked fine on my Galaxy 9+ when I used them indoors; however, if I walked outside with them the buds would begin to stutter and the connection would go in and out. I took every step I could find online to fix the issue. I spoke with Samsung customer service; more solutions other than to exchange the items. I called Verizon and spent an hour and half with their support and ended up changing my phone for another Galaxy 9+ under the assumption the problem was my phone. Got the new phone... same problems. I then exchanged the Galaxy Buds through Amazon. Got the new Galaxy Buds today... and well the new buds don't work either. My other bluetooth earbuds work fine. I returned the Galaxy Buds today for a refund. There seems to be a problem with the Galaxy Bud design. Either way I was very disappointed my experience with these earbuds. I've heard that because of the size of the buds, there's a lot of interference going through my pants pocket and through me to the buds. Well, I bought a cheaper pair of bluetooth earbuds, of similar size, that work perfectly on the first pair. Compared to the two Galaxy Buds I tried. Plus you would think that the assumption would be that a person would carry their phone in their pocket or a some bag(either purse of satchel) not inches from their head; otherwise, it's just using your phone as normal.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The original seal was ripped and there was another seal on top of it that doesn't look like the original. I couldn't get the box to open no matter what, some of the sides were glued shut when I tried getting my fingers in, the only way to open it was to cut it open. It seemed like someone used it and returned it. I decided not to open it and just return the thing itself. BEWARE: The seller was Amazon.

However, for the best sound quality, by my sound engineering experience, there is 3.5 mm out jack needed, and a good HiFi wired headphones such as B&O, Bose, or Sony :D if a you need to perform some simple sound engineering tricks using a smartphone :D
As for wireless buds, they have very good sound quality, good job Samasung.
While waiting my new galaxy from Samsung, I paired the buds with my LG V20!  LG V20 does not recognize Galaxy buds as a HiFi device (analog out B&O Play certified in V20 built for wired out only.. ) , but the installed galaxy buds plugin from Samsung does very good job - just needed to play with its settings.
I increased the sound volume to max in the buds, while in in my phone, the Bluetooth sound usually set <= to 60-70% - this gives better bass quality and very nice reach sound.
Will update my experience when receive my new Galaxy Note 10 by the end of Sept.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They dont seem to have a ""master bud"" like some sets do, you can just take out 1 and use that one and then take out the other when the first ones battery dies. When you just use 1 bud then the long press volume only does what that bud is programmed to do, for example if I just use the left bud the long press will only turn the volume down and if I use the right bud the long press will turn the volume up. When using just 1 bud your media pauses when you take it out, if you use both then you have to take both out for it pause, or just tap once on the touchpad of either bud. Doesnt automatically play when you put them back in, you have to tap the touchpad to play.
MAKE SURE HAVE THE RIGHT TIPS IN AND HAVE THEM AS DEEP AS POSSIBLE FOR OPTIMAL SOUND QUALITY
SUPER EASY SETUP: on my s9+, just make sure you have the samsung wearables app. Auto connects when case opens if you have bluetooth on.
 AMBIENT NOISE: mode is kind of weird, probably not best in class but could be improved through software update. But you could definitley hear cars and loud voices if you have ambient mode turned up (only works when you have both buds in ears) There is an update you need to install when you connect for the first time that takes about 2 minutes.
3 different size buds and fins included. Wireless charging works on highpower and low power charging mats not just on the back of an s10 device, usbC charging also available.
Tiny wireless charging case, weak magnets hold the buds in and guide them to the charging pins, you can shake the buds out if you have the case open, stronger magnets hold the case closed in your pocket, good and solid clicky case, satisfying to open and close.
 CUSTOMIZATION: You can customize the ""long press"" on the touch pads to turn volume up and down, turn on ambient mode or activate the digital assistant of your choice.
UI: No buttons, just a touch pad that is very responsive and it has sensors to know if they are in your ear and the touchpad doesnt work unless they are in your ear so you wont accidentally change your music when you take them out. Touchpad can be impeaded by hair over your ear. These buds and the case are tiny, you could probably hide them if you have long hair. Be sure you like tight fitting in-ear buds, everyones ears are different.
SOUND: If you arent an audiophile they are great, I personally dont see much of a difference in any earbuds no matter the price, they do sound alot better the deeper into your ear you can put them. They dont seem to get ear bursting loud but they do get very loud, good bass punch.
No onboard storage like the iconx.
BATTERY: I have not ran them to their limits yet but while using just one bud I listened to 5.5 hours of podcast (mostly voice) at about 35% volume and after the 5.5 hours the bud still had 40% battery left. When that ones battery runs out you can switch to the other by just picking it up and putting the other one in the case to charge.
INSTANT PAIRING: when you open the case and have bluetooth on they connect in less than 10 seconds, I have not had the little pop up window show up like in the ads but they instantly connect when you have bluetooth on.
Great purchase if you like in-ear style buds, kind of like ear plugs. Most features only available on Android, Samsung phones apparently work best though, Iphone works with basic features and siri.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Totally unnecessary if all your interested in is listening to music and calling folks.

A nice set of earbuds!!","June 18, 2019","My search for the best and most cost effective earbuds has not been a very easy or quick experience. I must have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews, saw many review videos, and tried and returned 7 different brands based on their recommendations, before I finally decided to go with the Galaxy earbuds. Honestly, I thought that I would never find a pair that sounded great with both phone and music, and had a decent battery life. You would think that the countless reviews on Amazon and other websites I looked at would make my decision easy, but this just wasn’t the case.

I actually found the reviews to be extremely unhelpful and so black and white that it made me completely confused. I would read 5 verified reviews praising a product for the exact same reason and then the next review would say that particular area of praise was shit. I mean really! Sometimes I think other brands have people do this to throw off potential buyers and if so it worked. But really, I just didn’t appreciate the sheer magnitude of this type of thing. It’s so frustrating as a potential customer to spend such a ridiculous amount of time trying to decipher which are true. We all have better things to do.

Ok so about these earbuds...This is everything you need to know without all the unnecessary crap.

These buds are extremely comfortable and come with several size rubber pieces to get a great fit.
Very reasonable price for such a great product.
They are the perfect size and not obtrusive at all. Also, the size of the case is very small so super easy to carry in a bag or your pocket.
You can touch gently to control your music, answer/hang up calls, etc.
They pair very easily to any Bluetooth and make a cool sound when they detect that they are in your ears. It’s automatic...
They have an app so if you have an Android you can download that allows you to customize your sound, ambient noise, and see any battery life remaining.
The sound for music is VERY good. They sound like you are in the front row of a concert. Rich, immersive, and not crazy base but definitely good base.
EVERYONE can hear me fine and not 1 person ever makes a comment or even knows I am on them. Also, I hear them great as well...Hallelujah! And you can use both (which gives the voice a stereo sound) OR you can just use one (either). If you take one out during a conversation the conversation keeps going without any disconnect.
They stay put when exercising, dancing, hanging upside down.
A voice says email or text when you get one.
The battery life is very good...I honestly haven’t counted the hours but I can wear them all day without any problem. I think I have maybe charged the case every few days or so...just depends on how long you are using them.

The ONLY negative for me is that they do seem to cut out for a second here and there when it’s windy outside. But for a very brief moment and that’s it. But really not a deal breaker at all, especially after I have experienced what else is out there.
Also, they might not be waterproof but they are sweat proof I think?

These buds survived 5+min swim in the deep end of my pool!","July 10, 2019","I'm a HUGE fan of Samsung in general. I discovered them over a decade ago and I've been with Samsung ever since. Some may say that fact alone renders my review to be biased. But they'd be wrong. Very wrong. I'm possibly more skeptical than anyone you know.
I've heard all kinds of claims about these buds barely being sweat resistant. Well, I've been using mine DAILY, sweating like crazy down in Houston Texas as well, and I'm amazed by the resilience of these crazy comfortable and light as a feather - great sounding {wireless} earbuds!!!!
Both the charging case and the buds fell into the deep end of my pool today by accident. Normally I would have dove right in to retrieve my precious tech. But all of those (false) claims of their water resistance told me to write them off and buy another pair.
It took me roughly 5 mins to grab the skimmer and scoop them out.
No one believes this next part, but I don't leave extremely positive reviews for the adrenaline rush! Lol.. I kid you NOT- whenever I grabbed the charging case out of the skimmer net (with the buds still inside mind you) THEY WERE STILL CHARGING!
THE INSIDE WAS A LITTLE WET, BUT IT MADE ZERO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER! IT'S BEEN ABOUT 3 HRS SINCE THE INCIDENT AND I'M STILL JAMMING MY FAVORITE PLAYLIST!
I'm completely amazed by the sound quality, battery life, connectivity, durability, style, options, etc.. of these very reasonably priced buds!
These earbuds have even saved me unknown amounts of money in terms of phone cases and screen protectors and deductibles for refurbishing or replacing broken screens, cases, protectors, etc.. seemingly everytime I would set my phone down after changing a song or whatever it may be because of the corded earbuds yanking my phone off the table and onto the floor.
In short, the true wireless feature alone, at least for me, is more than worth it because these have truly has paid for themselves a few times over by this point.

That being said... one would think, that with all the new advancements in protective coatings of late, that Samsung would have made the outside layer of the charging case FAR MORE scratch resistant than they are. After maybe 3 days of very limited and controlled careful use, I could barely make out the lettering on the top and bottom of the case.
In retrospect, my small complaint is just my skepticism finding anything possible to critique.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE TRULY WIRELESS EARBUDS TO ALL SAMSUNG GALAXY FANS ESPECIALLY. BUT ALSO TO ANYONE WHO WOULD RATHER SPEND LESS $ ON QUALITY EARBUDS.

Oh, and 1 more thang... this ain't no fake review.

Pros:
1. Excellent sound(for stereo), for ear-pods. I mostly listen to rock and metal, quite satisfied with the sound, the bass mostly.
2. Battery lasts long enough without using the cradle. about 5+ hours at full volume without recharge.
3. Cradle is small enough for carrying in your pocket, about the same volume as Apple airpods.
4. They don't have noise canceling, but the tight seal they form while wearing them seem like they do. Just turn the volume up and you're good to go.

Cons(all of these have pretty simple solutions):
1. Battery doesn't last long enough, would trade a slightly bigger cradle for more than 7 hours of extra battery. (just being picky).
2. The low volume default setting was off-putting at first but managed to solved it.
3. Cradle material feels slightly fragile and cheap, as if i drop them a couple of times, it will crack.

I own QC35, QC20, MDR7506. Tested WH1000XM3, QC35 II. For being a quite small piece of electronic, they do pack a punch. just enough for my taste. Since i like to travel light, they will perfectly substitute my QC20s (hate the wires and the big noise canceling brick) for now.

EDIT 1: A Month In: Work great still, battery lasts as long as its intended. BUT, it bugs me when they are connected to my galaxy S9+ and i open my pc and the connection changes to my pc. I open the blutooth settings, manually disconect the earbuds from the pc and manually conect them to my phone again. WITHIN SECONDS they reconect to my pc again...rinse and repeat till im fed up and have to remove them entirely from my pc. Turning off the pc bluetooth is not an option since i have other devices conected to it. Happens when im in the car too, i start the radio and they instantly disconnect from my phone. Setting the car radio to audio only doesnt seem to fix it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

When I listen to music, I wanna go deaf.  I'm not kidding.

That being said, the sound quality really depends upon your source.  I listen to just about any type of music (no rap, no country, no jazz).  So I fired up a few different genres and tried different settings with all of them.  Keep in mind that the bitrate makes a huge difference.

A few bits of music I listened to with these headphone:

1.  Judge Jules Creamfields - 2000 - Old school trance - This sounds great but it wasn't loud enough.  This is Trance Energy and I like it loud.  Sound quality for this oldy was pretty damned good, just wish it was louder.

2.  Hans Zimmer - Da Vinci Code - Chevaliers De Sangreal - FLAC format.  The song gives me the chills but the bass was slightly washed out and the highs were absent.  Also, it wasn't loud enough for me.  DAMN!  This song is a great song to test a sound system with and these earbuds were a 5/10.  So unfortunate.

3.  Simple Minds Live - FLAC format -  Just not loud enough.  Could use a little help with the highs as well.  The lyrics were drowned out by the music.  Disappointed with this one.

4.  Van Halen - Runnin With the Devil - Cuz I love David Lee Roth.  This is a 3.43mb MP3.  Everything sounds great with this song.  My only gripe... VOLUME.  I wanna hear Diamond Dave SCREAM but that's not happening with these.

5.  The Church - Reptile - My only complaint...  I'm not deaf yet.  Okay...  The bass was a little dull but not terrible.

6.  The Police - Synchronicity II because it's bad ass.  Sound is a bit washed out on this 6.07mb MP3 but it's okay.

7.  Grateful Dead - Sugaree 1977 live - It's about as loud as you'd want for this song... eh... maybe not.  It's a little washed out but what do you want from a 1977 recording?  Okay so I realized for this song I was on Bass Boost.  Taking off of Bass Boost and putting the head phones into Dynamic mode makes a HUGE difference (No longer washed out).  Still could be louder though.

8.  David Bowie - Heroes -  Sounds okay - The Man Who Sold the Word sounds about the same.  Two of my favorites from Bowie.

9.  Spiritualized - Ladies and Gentlemen We are floating in Space - Never heard of Spiritualized?  This is a great band to test out new headphones with.  Such a complex song.  The dynamic mode works for this song and sounds great.  Bass boost mode isn't too shabby either.

10.  Pink Floyd - Sorrow (Pulse) - It's my favorite post Waters song; might even be my favorite Pink Floyd song ever.  Dynamic mode is best but it needs to be louder.  Guitar solo at the end of the song needs to make me deaf and it wasn't happening with these.  :(  Overall, the sound was pretty damned good for this recording.  Anyway, I'm sure this isn't the song you wanted me to review so let me review TIME (DSOM Studio version)...  This sounds absolutely amazing but for some reason, the headphones keep cutting in and out.  (I'm writing this review real-time.  I wonder if the earbuds are overheating, it's getting annoying?)  *Update an hour later and it's no longer cutting in and out (Sounds amazing just wish it was louder).

11.  Echo & The Bunnymen - People are Strange (Doors Cover).  Who does the Doors better than the Doors?  Echo...  This song sounds great.  Only gripe?  You guessed it, I'm not deaf yet.

12.  ColdPlay - A Rush Of Blood To the Head - Live - This sounds absolutely phenomenal.  Even the volume was loud enough.  Vocals are crystal clear, music is perfect...  Everything is excellent.  Dynamic Mode.  I had to listen to another one of these from the same live show to see if it was still perfect.  Politik - Sounds is absolutely amazing.  Blew me away.  If every song I've reviewed was as crisp and clear as these, I'd given a 10 star review.  WOW!

13.  Radio Head - Creep - not bad, not as loud and crisp as the Cold Play I just listen to but it's good.  Needs to be louder.

14.  Darude (Trance) - Finland - Old School Trance Energy - Sound is pretty good.  Just wish the highs were a little higher and crisper.  Overall I'd give this a 6/10. Tried different modes but Dynamic Mode sounds best.

15.  Bon Jovi - Livin' On a Prayer - Crisp good sound.  Greatest hits...  Sounds great, bass could be a little better but the highs are high and the dynamic range is pretty good.  Same thing for Wanted Dead or Alive.  Nice sound, you won't be disappointed.

16.  U2 - The Unforgettable Fire - Sounds kinda dull so I tried another U2 song from a much newer album... Achtung Baby - Love is Blindness.  Sounded much better but still, there's an awful lot of bass in this song and I think the highs and lows are getting lost.  Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses Sounds better but still, the bass is a bit washed out.

17.  Sir Paul - Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey - This sounded just fine.  Dynamic mode and Bass boost mode although dynamic was a bit more... dynamic (It expanded the highs a bit and got rid of the slight muffle).

18.  Metallica - Master of Puppets - So unsatisfying.  This is the remastered version on spotify.  Sounds great but this needs to be LOUD and it's not.  Same with, Enter Sandman.  Ride The Lightning - NOT LOUD ENOUGH.  WTF.  This needs to be much louder.  Even the live version was not loud enough, however, sounded pretty damn good.  ""One"" Live sounds pretty damn good.

That's all for now.  I reviewed a bunch of various genres in real time.  Here's the thing.  I find that the recording and bit rates are going to have a major factor with whether you can appreciate these or not.  Since I'm not an audiophile, I'd have to say that you'll experience similar disappointment with any headphone that's not geared for a specific type of music.

Overall, I'd have to say these are a 3.5 out of 5.  They need a little work.  I'm listening for a few hours now and I'm at 70%.  of a 95% charge.  That's not too shabby.

I had a phone call which wasn't a great experience.  The person on the other end asked if I was on a speaker phone.  I asked if I was coming in clear and they said, ""Yes but it sounds like I'm on speaker"".  The caller wasn't as clear as my 4yr old Plantronics earpiece either.

I'll come back in a few days and give another review.  This is my first day with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'm training for a marathon so I really wanted a pair that I could wear running totally hands free. Almost every run they would just stop working and I'd have to restart my phone. When I finally got them to work again, they would constantly cut out with almost every step I took. It was so incredibly frustrating. Even just walking they would cut out with my phone in my pocket.

Warranty does not cover replacement.","July 31, 2019","I bought these earphones on April 3, 2019. The wireless charging case stopped charging the earbuds in July 2019. These earbuds are used for the office to block out noise so there was very little wear and tear on the unit. I called Samsung customer care since it was within 1 year of purchase. Samsung sent me a wall plug and a charging cable...

After receiving the wall plug and charge cable, I called Samsung to ask why a wireless charging case was not sent out as discussed with the previous customer representative. The second customer rep apologized and told me that the one year Samsung warranty for the wireless earbuds does not cover the wireless case. My only option is to buy the entire set. I can't just buy the charging case.

Did I mention that I bought these wireless earbuds on April 3, 2019 and they stopped working July 2019? Great warranty Samsung. I should have bought a Jabra elite 65t instead.

I opened the ear bud case and my Galaxy S9 immediately notified me of a new set of buds in the area. Connection could not have been smoother. The only setting I had to change was the long hold initially set to activate Bixby. Thru the galaxy wear app I could change it to control volume. left side down, right side up. The fact that the buds are touch sensitive and not buttons is a huge selling point. A prior set had buttons which would have to be pressed firmly for up to 5 seconds to activate menus. these are just a light press or tap.  They are so light. hardly noticeable that they are even in with the exception of the music that is blasting out of them by personal preference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have these in on the subway to work and home playing music not even at max volume. The other day, there was an argument in the car next to mine, not even 20 feet away that involved the police once the train had stopped, and I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE BECAUSE OF HOW WELL THE NOISE CANCELLATION WAS. I only noticed since people were looking back and we hadn't moved, once I press and held to turn on ambient noise mode I could hear yelling. I took out my buds and chaos to my ears. I was standing there as this lady was screaming at the police and remember being super impressed at how I didn't hear anything going on with these in.

I've never had wireless buds before so I was scared of them falling out but they haven't and it's a snug but comfortable fit.

The connection does otherwise suffer sometimes. I’ve had two sets of Galaxy Buds and used them with a few different phones. My biggest issue is an occasional lag where the earbuds will get out of sync with each other for a second (normally the left one), then sync back up. It’s jarring and seems to happen in crowded areas, possibly due to wireless interference.

voice calls are enhanced by a pair of microphones in each earbud that work to isolate your voice.

They used to hurt my ears a little bit, but now that I've grown accustomed, I don't notice it at all), and I've never worried that they'll fall out when I have the wings on.

My one complaint. Phone calls. When talking with people, I've had lots of complaints about me sounding pretty quiet and the background noise being really loud. If you're outside while on the phone, the mic picks up even the slightest breeze. It can make it pretty dofficult to communicate.

-Nice function for the case to be wireless charge-capable
-Earbuds are comfortable, have other size options if necessary
-Earbuds themselves turn on when in your ear, making them quite efficient for battery
-Easy connectivity with phone (using Samsung S9+)

-Sound quality leaves much to be desired - using the equalizer in the Galaxy Wearable app is a must
-Lack of much customization for custom user commands with the long press
-Not waterproof (I bought another pair of wireless headphones for about $40 that were great and water resistant)
-Ambient Sound mode is a bit tough to really see the potential for at first (personal thing).

I like these headphones quite a bit. I've been a Samsung fella for some time, so I'm going to use these for longer and make an update later. These are mainly first impressions.

This is my first totally wireless pair though. That part I love! The Galaxy Ear Buds connect very easily, have nice software features and work great with my Note 9.
They are almost perfect!
However, I still have the same problem with these as I've had with all wireless buds... little disconnects and stutters. It seems if you hold your head still and look straight forward, these keep a great connection but if you turn your head or look down much, it seems they break up some. I've been trying to pinpoint it but have yet to find a pattern.
While they work almost flawlessly, the sound and comfort of these are fantastic! My only complaint is the losing signal part. It doesn't happen a lot but enough to be annoying.
So, if you've had that problem in the past with ear buds or wireless in general, I don't think you will find these much different. The big difference in these is the easy setup with the phone, the instant connection when you pull them out and put them in and the sounds quality which I find to be pretty dang good. I think the price is pretty good too.

After a month the left ear bud crapped out, the case opens and the ear buds going flying if you drop them. Honestly just purchase air pods and some little rubber ear buds to fit ur ear better if that’s the case.

Thinks like noise cancellation (which these don't actually do), isolation (which they do well), ambient noise passthrough, good battery life, and the like? Those are just nice to have.

The Galaxy Buds do a lot of those nice-to-have things, but they don't do the basics especially well.

Pros:
+ Great sound isolation (note: they don't have active noise cancelling)
+ Great battery life
+ Some fancy advanced features like ambient noise, equalizer, touch controls that work well, etc.

Cons:
- Connection quality is poor. If I keep my phone (a Note 9; another Samsung product) in my left pocket, and turn my head to the right, they will cut out. The connection is often static-filled even when the phone is sitting on my desk, five feet away, with a clear line of sight.
- Microphone stops working after a while. I have a lot of conference calls for work, where I'm often sitting on mute. If I need to speak later on in the call, I'll take the phone off mute, but the microphone has stopped working. I can disconnect the buds and use the phone speaker fine.

If not for the fit issues, I would have rated this a 5.  But the fit of the buds in my ear are a big factor and a disappointment.  Other than that, everything else is ok.  I am just dissatisfied with the fit.  After seeing family members with the Apple Airpods, I was considering purchasing those (before buds came out). Although I wouldn't get the full benefit of the Airpods being that I own an Android Samsung device, they looked to be a good option for hands-free.  I was excited when Samsung came out with the Galaxy Buds for their devices.  I could now have something similar to Airpods to cater to the device I own. But I became disappointed when I realized the buds do not fit comfortably in my ear. I have tried all 3 of the supplied eartips/wingtips.  I can be walking and one would fall out of my ear.  I have to be careful how I move about because they are just not secure. I am hesitant in using them when working out for fear of losing one. Even now, sitting at my desk at work, they feel as though they are about to fall out.  I wanted to love them so bad but it just hasn't worked out for me. Sadly

I had airpods before, loved them. However I found they were really easy to lose, which is exactly what happened. I lost them. Or maybe someone stole them? I'll never know.

So now I wanted new wireless headphones, but I didn't want to shell out over 150+ dollars just for some headphones. I admit the airpods are great, but are they worth over 150 dollars of my hard earned money for some wireless capabilities? I didn't think so.

So I tried the 30-50 dollar headphones, some were a hit or miss but most of them were a miss. If they had good sound quality, they had bad bluetooth connection. If they had good bluetooth connection, they had poor sound. You get where I am going with this.

So I decided to shell out a little bit more, and get the galaxy buds. This was the sweet spot that I was looking for.

The Pros:
-the sound quality is good-also in the app you can change the type of preset sound you want, such as soft, bass boosted, dynamic, higher treble, etc.
-they last a good while. The case charges them and they work seamlessly when you put them on and off. just like the airpods
-has wireless charging
-they are nicer looking than the airpods (in my opinion, because there's no awkward rod sticking out. Some people don't have the right ears for it and it looks really silly)
-and can fit ANY ear unlike the airpods
-they have noise cancellation. I turned it on and off with the app to see if it was true and it does have ACTUAL noise cancellation.
-decent price
-good touch commands(but this also can be a con)

Cons
-the commands arent really configurable or advanced. There's no swipe for volume or anything and you can only customize the long hold. The single, double and triple tap commands are locked in. Not a deal breaker but something to understand.
-build quality, although more expensive than the cheaper china-brand ones, seemed similar. There was not much glossy finish to make it look sexy(again not a deal breaker)

for those who want to just say they have the airpods for stature or want to show off to people, I'd say stick with the airpods. The airpods still I believe are the best tiny buds, in terms of SOUND QUALITY for music. However these buds are for those who want functionality, with practicality, at a reasonable price. I said the airpods didnt seem like they were worth the 150+ dollars spent. Galaxy buds however, are they worth the 100 dollars?...I'd say a solid yes","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They are comfortable and I didn't have to change the tips or wings because out of the box it was perfect!

Like every new product there will be some issues. I have seen some issues with music cutting out here or thier for a slight second and it fixes it self. Samsung did just update them today which seems to have fixed Bluetooth issues but just know Samsung is working on fixing any issues we have with these.

This does feature ambient sound which is an awesome feature that just lacks a bit. I feel after a few updates this will be amazing and one of the best features!

Call quality on these have been good but have noticed slight cutting out every once in a while but could be due to service and we're I'm located. The people on the other end can hear me perfectly in door and out so that's always good.

Overall I would highly suggest getting them if you have Samsung or not because of the price and the awesome features it has already built in.

Sager","A ""must have"" for Samsung Smartphones","October 4, 2019","After reading the reviews of this product, I  honestly don't think a lot of people understand the difference between wireless earbuds and full over-ear wireless cans. Huge difference. Having said that, these wireless buds are a ""best of breed"" product. I have a Samsung S10 and these pair perfectly with that phone. The app is great. Very easy to set up and use. They are extremely comfortable and can be worn for extended periods of listening. The sound quality is really, very good. I listen to a variety of music - admittedly not hip hop, and the depth of these buds is excellent. Bass is good - not thumping. Mids are spot on and the highs are clear without being shrill or tinny. Volume is loud. The maximum level will not make your ears bleed, but it's plenty loud. Noise cancelling is good - not great, but good is still ""good"". They do not compare to high end, over-ear head phones. They cost way less than high end head phones. So my verdict is; this is a great earbud for the price and a ""must have"" if you own one of the new Samsung smartphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have shelled out collectively close to $1,000 and tried all the major brands. While my overall experience has been pretty positive, my individual experience with each has been a combination of highs and lows. That is until I tried the Samsung Galaxy Buds. On paper, the features for these things looked pretty amazing - 6 hour playtime with an additional 7 hours stored in the case, wireless charging, automatic pairing when the case is opened, touch controls, I mean, what's not to like? Then I actually put them in my ears and started my workout. This was going to be the real test. When using earbuds, the single most important feature is the fit, because if the bud doesn't conform to your ear properly and create a tight seal, the sound will be washed and the base nonexistent. The way the buds came out of the package did not form that seal for me, but the additional tips and ear stabilizers gave me more options. After switching out the stock setup, I was pleased to find that I was able to achieve that seal, and let me tell you, the sound is impressive. I'm fairly certain the base was the best I've experienced of any buds I've owned. As far as my workout went, the Galaxy Buds didn't move a millimeter. Not when I was rowing, not when I was deadlifting, and not when I was slamming battle ropes. I can't honestly say I've successfully put any other bud through my workout routine without getting at least some movement, which ultimately broke the seal and ruined the sound. I think the Galaxy Buds passed this test for two reasons. First, the stabilizers keep the outer part of the bud firmly in place, and don't allow any space for them to move. Second, the bud itself is almost flush with the ear, so there isn't much projecting outward to create the leverage needed for wobble. Another awesome feature is the ambient sound option. When ambient sound is turned on, you can actually hear the outside world in addition to your music. It's actually quite mind boggling when you use it. I'm assuming it uses the mic that picks up your voice during phone calls to receive external sound and pipe it through the buds with your music. I'm so happy with the performance of the Samsung Galaxy Buds that I keep an additional pair charged in my car to wear when I work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've owned everything from iPods, to Apple Watches to the iPhone X. I still think they are great products. However, I switched to Samsung about 6 months ago. Why? Well, I don't want to paint myself into any corners and with the ease of trading in phones I figured I'd give Samsung a try in case I was missing anything.

Boy, was I missing things. IMO, Samsung is just far easier to set up. Samsung has more apps and abilities for me personally. Samsung is just overall better in nearly all facets of this game.

Now, on to these ear buds. In summary...I love them. They are as close to perfect as anything you'll ever buy under $200. (I paid $129). The fit is great. The sound quality is fantastic. I don't consider myself a sound snob, but these are clear and loud. I have seen some reviews complaining about the loudness, but I think these people didn't realize that you can adjust the loudness settings via the app. And how great is it that as soon as I opened up the case they found and paired with my Samsung Galaxy Note 9? How great was it that I was able to open my laptop and see that my ear buds were an option without having to do anything? I mow the lawn with these. I work out with these. I sit at my desk and listen to music while at work with these. If you're considering these or the Jabra's or Apple Earpods...just get the Samsung.

The charging case itself also has some power issues and constantly needs plugged in or placed on a charging pad because it can't produce its own charging power to the buds. Regardless, I could have it plugged in for hours and the right bud won't get above 50% while the left is full. Customer service just wants to pass my problem around from representative to representative without even knowing what to do to fix it. Great product save the battery issue... I assume they've worked on it with the newer models but regardless, buying through Amazon has been less than ideal as Samsung would have honored the replacement warranty without question or handing off my concern to the next person if I had ordered through fire directly.

Well done Samnsung.","April 1, 2019","EDIT: I am giving these an updated 4 star review. It happens randomly, but the Bluetooth connection gets choppy when only a couple feet away from the Buds. If I have my phone in my pocket and bend over or reach to grab something, the connection cuts in and out at random times. It has only happened a handful of times. So we'll see if it becomes a constant problem. The battery life is solid, however. I used them for 3 hours and still had 40% battery. I still stand by my initial review. They are great, but maybe need a couple bugs worked out still.

These things are amazing. I had purchased a $70 no name brand Bluetooth Airpod look alike. They were cheap garbage. They constantly lost signal and had terrible sound quality. They also didn't fit my ear and fell out multiple times. So I decided to drop the money on the Galaxy Buds. They have been well worth the money, at least so far. The difference is almost uncomparable. They came with the medium ear tip and wingtip installed. The Buds fit my ears perfectly right out of the box. The sound quality is insane and the connection is strong, with no loss of signal at all**see edit.

The ambient noise reduction is pretty damn impressive. The option to either turn on the ambient sound filter permanently or temporarily by holding the Bud is extremely useful. I have been using the Dynamic equalizer setting and have found it hard to hear certain sounds without the ambient sound option enabled. So I suggest experimenting with what sounds good to you so you don't have any safety issues. These things really do block a lot of sound.

They are incredibly easy to connect to a Galaxy device. Make sure to download the Galaxy Wearable app beforehand to make connecting even faster. After connecting and charging, I used them for over an hour straight and the battery was still at 90%. I will update on battery life in detail after more use. Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase. If you are looking for new headphones and have the funds, I say buy a pair. I plan to update my review if anything drastic or alarming happens. But so far, I highly recommend the Galaxy Buds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

-Fit my tiny ears, comfortably
-Can be used together or independently
-Happy I've spent the money for the quality

I have gotten some cheap earbuds over the years, bought a different set and returned them the next day due to not fitting at all just before getting these. Granted the tech has improved as a function of time. These are worth every dollar so far.
I have small ears, finding buds that will fit is very hard (even using the smallest options). These are the most comfortable and secure I've ever tried.
Being able to use each bud independent of the other was a huge factor in deciding on these over the more expensive ones I was eyeing. I'm still getting used to the touch aspect, I like it though. You don't need to mash them into your ear to get the button to engage. The set-up was super easy and I like that there's an app for further control/customization.
It's a bit disappointing that the case dosn't have a bigger battery for more charges. That's a small gripe though since I tend to only use one at a time.
These aren't for hard audiophiles, from what I've seen so far. If that's a deal-breaker; go drop on some corded-over ear monitors.
So happy I took the plunge on these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I recommend using them with Dolby Atmos turned on, it improves the quality and volume even more. Keep the setting on dynamic mode.

They Wont Fall Out!","November 7, 2019","These are my first pair of wireless ear buds! I am pretty surprised and impressed by the quality of them in each category.

I dont have much luck with ear buds staying in my ear. Especially the Apple earbuds. However, these are some of the first that I am not having to be pushing back into my ear at all. In addition to having the in-ear tips, they also have soft, comfortable fins on the top that locks the bud into your ear. While I can feel the earbuds themselves in my ear, this upper locking ""fin"" is not intrusive at all.

Sound quality is great! Bass is rather deep and everything seems balanced. Because they are in ear, they have some pretty great natural noise cancelation. I feel pretty immersed whenever I'm listening. They also have this ambient sound feature that can be toggled on and off. It allows the listener to let certain sounds through so that you can hear your surroundings and not be totally isolated.

Charge time is fast. The case they come in is sleek looking. And it has wireless power share from a Samsung device.

The bluetooth tether distance is pretty far too. Ive left my phone in the back yard and walked into the house and was still able to listen! In general, the bluetooth has never dropped on me.

My only piece of criticism is when using the touch pads, on the buds, when they are in my ear. Tapping on them is akin to tapping on a drum. It's not the worst thing in the world, but something to note.

I cant imagine how the new Apple earbud Pros would be better than this. They have many of the same features such as noise passthrough and the Samsung buds are $150 cheaper.

Wanted so much to like these. For the most part I do, with one overwhelming negative... they cutout. The more I use them the more I notice they cut out. Phone in your pocket and you lean over, cut out. Turn your head, cut out. Hand against your head, cut out. Any activity, except sitting at a desk, you can expect them to cut out. 83.5% of the time they stay connected, but that 16.5% drives me crazy. Maybe I'm expecting too much, maybe bluetooth technology isn't capable of meeting my expectations. I've tried every suggestion to improve this issue with no success. Have requested a replacement pair in hope that I got a bad set so will update review if those work out
Pro:
Great fit
Comfortable
Sound good
Look good
Wireless charge

Con:
Cut out

The sound quality actually was a pleasant surprise. I really wasn't expecting much from it sound quality wise, the actually sounded pretty good. I find that higher volumes is where seem to get the punchiness of the bass. Mids and top ends r clear (not the crispiest but crispy).

The earpieces were a snug seal that even when I jumped up and down, never even move to come out. That seal also helps with the sound quality a lot. I did have to tweak the settings on the Buds app on my phone to find the right balance of sound. The sound it'self is great. The balanced sound had clear vocals and solid bass, I like the concept that you can maintain awareness of your surroundings. I tested it out while listening to TV, for example, you can hear the difference. I also like that I can answer calls I tested by making a few business calls to my client's offices and they seemed to have no problem hearing me. I could hear them clearly Overall, I am very happy and excited to use these! I LOVE being totally wire-free and the convenience and comfort of these.

I have never had something I bought instantly become a part of my ""daily carry items"". I never leave home without these things. They are so easy to pair to my phone, by the time the earbud is in my ear, it's connected to my phone and I can talk on the phone or listen to music.

I will say that sometimes there is issue with the connection quality if the phone is in your pocket, but given how darn awesome these things are, that's not an issue for me.  Sound quality is good all things considered, but I'm no audiophile so I would understand if some people might be disappointed. I also thing the noise cancelling is good considering is passive cancelling. Battery life hasn't been an issue.

According to what I have been able to find you would have to be using Windows 8 or an earlier version to have compatibility with the Galaxy Ear Buds via your PC Bluetooth connection.

Let’s start with the fact there is no compatibility to a PC via Bluetooth. Regardless if your PC is Bluetooth ready, these may may not pair. They didn’t work with my brand new Dell Latitude 5290 running Windows 10. Hence, if you travel with a laptop or use it to listen to music while working you may be plain out of luck.
Second issue is if you want to use these with an IPhone you may want to reconsider this. I did get sound from them and they did pair. However, there is no supporting app I’m in the apple App Store which means you can’t update firmware unless you go to a store and have them do it. That was Samsung’s work around for this issue. Also all you can do is listen and talk without any of the so called features.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After a few hours of comparisons and a full workout in each, I am sticking with the galaxy buds. The sound quality is better, more clarity and depth, but a little less bass. The ambient noise feature is unique, but nice and I'll have to play around with it. These were much more comfortable for longer wear than the jlabs. Both stayed in place well, but these do not stick out as much. That made them feel more secure and I touched them less. The touch pad is intuitive, but sensitive. I stopped my music a few times on accident. I pair these with a galaxy s8, and the galaxy wear app provides additional controls and EQ settings that are nice. Glad I spent a little extra to try them. However, the jlab air buds are a quality product, especially if you don't own a Samsung phone. Attached photos show relative size difference between the galaxy buds and jlab air buds.

 - Great fit.  They fit nice and snug and don't feel at all like they want to come loose.  I've had many other nice (wired) earbuds, and some that come with different ear hole cups.  None have been large enough to fit snug.  The large size cups and rings on the Galaxy buds fit perfect.
- Sound quality is good.  Not great, but good.
- The charging case is nice and works well.
- Battery life seems good.
- Bluetooth performance is poor, and I'm talking about range, not sound.  I have an S9, and this phone works great with my gear wearable and my car stereo via bluetooth.  I normally have my phone in my back pocket, and the buds do not work well at all with it there.  In my front pocket its better, but if I turn my torso at all in either direction, the sound cuts out and gets choppy right away.  These two factors alone are enough for me to wish I hadn't spent the money on these.  I should have waited another year for version 2.

Very little bass even w/ the equalizer settings maximizing the bottom. I much prefer the sound quality of my Bose (wired) noice canceling in-ear phones.

Cole","Works better on iPhone than on Galaxy","August 23, 2019","I want to start out by saying I really like the overall physical design of these headphones.  They are really nice feeling and ergonomic in a way that my old AirPods just never were.  Also the sound quality is top notch when it comes to music or spoken-word audio.  The noice cancelling aspect works great which can be easily overridden with a feature that allows you to hear ambient sounds (a feature only usable on Android devices, unfortunately).

I purchased these as AirPod replacements.  I wanted something with some proper water resistance and good audio quality.  My AirPods had slipped out of my hands one day and fell right into a puddle.  They still work but at a significantly reduced sound quality.  After reading reviews on several different kinds of wireless earbuds, I eventually settled on these as a replacement set.  They worked very well on my iPhone, however a major downside to using these with an iOS device is you don't have access to the ""Galaxy Wearable"" App which allows you to adjust settings or use the ambient sound feature.  This doesn't make a lot of sense since there already is a Galaxy Watch app for iOS which allows you to use Samsung Galaxy watches on iPhone.  I feel like this App should be ported over, it could only mean more sales for Samsung if they did.  As they are now, for the basics of listening to music or other audio, making phone calls or talking to Siri, they work great.

Then I had another water-related mishap with my iPhone and I was forced to revert back to my old Samsung Galaxy S6.  On the S6 I've had a very mixed experience.  I can now use the App and now have a more feature-rich experience.  The different options inside the Wearable app are pretty neat and contain a lot more detail than what you could achieve with the AirPods running natively on iPhone.  However, one gigantic flaw that I experienced to a limited degree on iPhone began to become insurmountable on the Galaxy: the bluetooth connection.  These headphones have the most strange relationship with their connected device once you go outside.  If I understood better the different radio frequencies at play with WiFi and Bluetooth maybe I could go into detail about what must be going on here, but near as I can tell anytime you reach the edge of any given WiFi range, the signal between the phone and the headphones begins to distort.  So if you want to use your headphones to listen to music or something while jogging in the neighborhood, they are functionally useless since you are always in this dead-zone and distortion occurs.  The sound crackles and skips or just goes silent.  The audio is still playing on the device and once you get back in a distortion-free area you can hear it again, not paused or anything but having advanced normally as if you could hear the whole time.  There are some strange workarounds.  If I take the phone out of my pocket and hold it close to my head, the issue does not occur.  If I take my phone out and place it on a table outside, that also seems to work and I can hear fine while I stay within the normal Bluetooth range from the phone.

No, I am not streaming audio over Wifi, this happens regardless of whether the audio I'm listening to has been downloaded to the device or is being streamed.  I can turn WiFi off on my phone and it'll still happen.  Indoors I have almost never experienced this nor have I had it happen in my car.  It only seems to happen out of doors vaguely near buildings.  If I'm away from any buildings its fine.  This is why I am attributing it to a conflict between the WiFi signal and the bluetooth signal.  I don't have this issue with my AirPods or any other wireless headphones I've used over the years.  This is a massive pain and severely reduces their usability.  As such, they are very difficult to recommend.  If they can fix this with a future firmware update (which seems like something they should be able to do), then I can rate these higher.  The issue isn't as pronounced on iPhone.  However, without the app, there is no option to get updates and as such any issues you have will never get fixed.

EDIT 10/4/19: Several updates have come out since posting this and there have been some slight changes.  It seems like the problems I was having with distortion while out-of-doors have slightly improved.  The nature of the distortion has changed from an analog distortion sound to a digital distortion sound if that makes a any sense at all.  It distorts a little, little less than before, but it's almost unchanged.  They are still almost completely useless if you carry your phone in your pants pocket outside.  If you want to use them outside, you'll need to put your phone in a shirt pocket, hold it in your hand out at an angle, carry it in a purse so long as the bag doesn't hang below your hips, or use one of those armbands that were a thing back when people went jogging with their iPods.  I am a living/breathing sunk-cost fallacy so I will continue to use these headphones for at least another year to justify the cost, then I'm just hoping that whatever Apple is planning with their next release of the AirPods will include waterproofing and better audio.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Unfortunately,  negatives far surpass the positives.

PROS:
Design - I love the design. They fit completely in the ear without any ""extras"" dangling down like the Airpods
Fit - Extremely comfortable & stayed in my ears during my run without any problem. I have small ear canals & ear buds often hurt my ears. These did not bother me at all even after a few hours of wear.
iPhone Connection - It was easy to connect the Galaxy Buds to my iPhone by selecting them in my iPhone's Blue Tooth settings
Charging Case - case is compact, sleek & easy to operate

CONS:
Sound Quality - If you're a sound connoisseur these are definitely not for you. I bought these solely for running & to replace my Plantronics Backbeat Fit 300. The sound quality of the Galaxy Buds was notably inferior to the BB Fit. I was willing to compromise on sound for complete wireless convenience, but...
Noise Canceling - Non-existent. So much ambient noise bleeds through it's unbelievable. I wore these in the airport & could barely hear the music playing on my iPhone despite having the volume turned up quite loud.
Connection Issues - As I mentioned above, I bought the Galaxy Buds primarily for running.  I took the Galaxy Buds on my first run & paired them to my Apple Watch. The entire 3.5 mile run the Galaxy Buds snapped, crackled & popped. I can only guess they were having trouble staying connected to my Apple Watch which was on my wrist no more than 2 feet away at any time. I never had this issue with the Plantronics Backbeat Fit ear buds. For me, this was the deal breaker. By the time I finished my first mile I wanted to tear the Galaxy Buds from my ears & throw them in a ditch. The constant popping was unbearable. I turned the music volume up which helped to mask some of the crackling sound & was grateful I had only gone out for a short run.

Sadly, I'll be returning these little guys.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I remember thinking: “why AKG would put a bad driver here when even their cheaper headphones are so good for the price? Why Samsung, using bluetooth 5.0, wouldn’t put a decent sound?""

 Well, either some reviewers (I mean Youtubers and web reviewers) are deaf, or the latest software update changed radically this TWE, because the sound is good! (as usual, just finding a good seal with the correct eartip size).

I'm not an active person outside of my work, which requires that I be able to hear, so my use for them is simply the convenience of walking into the more populated areas of my house without disturbing people when I do venture into the abyss that is social situations.

Battery life: I'm just going to get this one out of the way. I think after we all did the 3 hours of research comparing the top dogs of true wireless earbuds, we threw the idea of going days untethered from charging wires out the window with these.  No one is expecting exceptional battery life from these and neither was I.
 I can say that the buds alone seem to have the will to go well into what I'd consider lengthy use sessions of around 4-6 hours of YouTube and less on the music end.  The sacrifice to the technology gods we make when buying these though, is the case. This case is weak sauce, sometimes holding what I'd consider to barely even be a full charge for them. It does make up for it with it's hysterically compact design. Lil pill boi.

Sound quality: I've owned apple airBUDS (not pods), samsung akg headphones, onemore triple drivers, and currently own onemore quad drivers. I'm an audiophile who knows nothing about sound but i'm not so primitive as to not be able to differentiate between to experiences. These compare most closely to wired triple drivers in the hierarchy of sound quality. I was pleasantly surprised with the highs and base of these guys. They aren't top of the line but they pack a punch that goes well beyond any out of the box wired headphones that come with a phone.  I'm not kidding.  For convenience sake, I rarely use my quad drivers anymore.

Functionality: The bluetooth is flawless in timing and instantly connects to your phone. The range is average. At about 30ft and between multiple walls and one story above me they started to lose connection. The touchpad is annoying as it seems to go off with a brush of the arm if I'm not trying to touch them but as soon as I want to pause I need to give it multiple taps sometimes. That's not going to be used again.  The ambient noise is noticable but not usable due to it being really selective with what it lets through.

I can definitely say they're 100% worth the money for me and I won't be on the market until they break.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Great snug yet comfortable fit and don't fall out after months of use in a variety of activities and exercise. Great noise cancelling for buds when mowing grass and on airplane. Not complete noise cancellation, but close when playing music. Exceptional crisp sound, best I have heard on any buds. Would be nice to have a little more bass, but better than any buds I have tried, probably need larger headset to get more bass. Love auto play music option when place in ears. Never need to turn on or off, automatically turns on when place in ear and off when place in case. Very innovative case, easy to open yet firmly closes to keep from accidentally opening. Wireless charging in small case minimizes burden of charging and gradual green/yellow/red light helps warn battery level to avoid surprise loss of battery power.  Samsung deserves some type of tech award, these buds are brilliantly designed and worth the price. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The setup was more involved than a simple pair of bluetooth headphones, however it is understandable considering the features and tech that is packed into them. They are linked to the Galaxy Wearable app which controls different features including noise cancelling, the touchpad buttons, the equalizer, and the find my earbuds feature. They fit in my ear very well and come with adjustable ear insert thingies to fit different ear shapes/sizes. They case/box they come in also double as a charger which can charge wirelessly. I have been vigilant of other wireless earbud wearers and these seem to be fairly low profile in comparison. The sound quality is pretty good. Good highs, ok lows, and a dynamic mode on the equalizer that is a good balance of sound. I thought the sound quality would be just a little better but still great for the price. The battery life seems great, no complaints.

The sound quality and battery life is excellent compared to the obvious competitor (Airpods). A small, sleek case that fits easily in your pocket and allows wireless charging. Great noise cancellation by default, because they form a seal in your ear, which further improves the overall sound quality vs. the open style of Airpods, particularly in the bass department.

It's also good for work environments since you can use one at a time and once the battery on one gets low just put tmit in the case to charge and use the other, though if you want to use both it still has good battery life I'll say about 3-4 hrs if you like to blas your music. If you have small ears like me it'll still fit if you have big ears they'll fit like a glove. They also dont take that long to charge and the case doesn't take long to charge either.

Sound quality is good for earbuds that are 100% wireless.

I'll recommend these over earpods because they come with wing tips and the airpods doesn't.

Once paired with your device all you have to do to connect is turn on your Bluetooth and open the case.

The touch pad is pretty responsive.

If you watch videos on YouTube at x1.75 or x2 speed like myself I won't recommend it there's a huge delay, watching at normal speed is good though.

I didn't really expect it to be so difficult to hear people talking to me. You can turn on the ambient sound booster but it hisses. So you can't just wear them while you are in a social environment (or at the office). My solution was to wear just one.

The audio quality when playing music seems a little dull. The quality is on par with or below regular old cheapo earbuds. Perhaps I don't have them seated properly.

Sadly, one of the reasons I got these was for mobile gaming/media. Unfortunately, the latency is garbage. Audio is at least a half second delayed.

These aren't terrible or perfect, but there doesn't seem to be a useful fit for them in my life apart from hands free calling while driving.

These are extremely light and comfortable regardless of how many times you take them out and put them back in your ears.  The sound is great/good. The connection is distance is great and so is the size and look in public. The only 2 issues which i experience a couple times a day is first it gets some kind of interference as if your connection breaking up even tho its in your pocket.

Hayes","Convenient, but connection could be better","April 13, 2019","I bought these for use with my iPhone X because AirPods and other earbud style headphones don’t stay in my ears.

I particularly like the fit, as the in-ear design both keeps them secure and blocks out noise. They’re also very light which means you can wear them for long periods of time without worrying about discomfort. The small size means they also don’t look odd shoved in your ears like some competitors.

Sound quality is decent, but won’t blow anyone away. My biggest issue, however, is that I consistently have connection problems while walking. I can use these without issue while working out but if I use them while walking on my lunch break (in a city) I’m met with lots of dropouts and interference. I have to hold my phone above my waist for a consistent connection. Thus far I haven’t figured out what causes the interference as it doesn’t happen in other situations (gym, home, airplanes/airports, etc.)

Still, despite the issues while walking I’m generally happy with these.

EDIT: After a recent firmware update I’ve had far fewer connection issues so my biggest issue has pretty much been taken care of. I’ve adjusted my review to 4 stars as a result.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Amazon did not dissapoint on delivery.  2. The buds were a gamble. 3. After updating the software and fitting the buds, I can't complain.

At first, I was sceptical on the low range of sound, but honestly they're just good.

The mid and high are great off the rip.

Bass took boost from the wear app, but it is genuinely solid. We tried some Dr. Dre, some Clint Mansell, Halsey, Madonna, and GoT theme.

Fitted and ready, these are very nice.  They aren't going to blow out your skull, though.

As far as the product itself, well, they're pretty great for what they're meant to do, especially, when you consider the fact that the Sennheiser and many other rivals cost twice as much (or more) without any real benefits because these sound amazing, the noise isolation is superb, they're comfortable and light. The battery lasts a long time and they're easy to use.
The only real issue is the fact that the Bluetooth seems to cut in and out, a lot, I tried to change the settings but it doesn't seem to have any impact on the issue.

I wanted to love these buds but they suck and I don't love them at all. I returned a pair of soundcore neo's that sounded twice as good at half the price but had some connectivity issues when my galaxy s9 plus was in my pocket and I was walking or running. So I bought these Samsung Buds figuring they'd be much better, especially at more than double the price. I'm not sure whether connectivity is better because I couldn't get past the horrible tinny sound and lack of volume. I went into the Samsung Wearable app and set the volume at Max, maxed volume on my phone as well, but they're just garbage. Low volume AND horrible sound quality. And it's not just this particular set, either. I paired a set my friend has and same thing. So save your money and buy the soundcore neo's, maybe you won't have the same issues I had. Or, spend a little more and buy the Sony's like I'll be doing right now.  UPDATE. I decided give these buds buds more of a chance. I have an xl ear chamber so replaced the largest sized tips(included with buds) with a larger pair that I had from another set that still allow the buds to fit in the case and accept a charge. Doing that improved the performance of these buds dramatically. As far as volume goes I've gotten used to the max volume of these buds and find it to be quite sufficient since I now get a better seal from the larger tips. I've changed my two star rating to four, and would give them a five if Samsung included some xl size tips for those of us with larger ear canals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

It might take a couple of tries to find the right size of buds to attach so that they fit snugly in your ear though. But once you do, it blocks out a lot of the sound, and I NEVER put the volume past the ""unsafe levels"" and I like my music LOUD. Its loud enough that I can only hear my music when jogging, its great.

Speaking of jogging, these things have never once popped out during any strenuous activities/exercise either. Sometimes I'll be upside down for ab exercises and they've never fallen out.

I had tried the Bose wireless headphones before, way too big and clunky, fell out who knows how many times in the 1 week I had them before I returned them. AND the biggest thing that made me return them was because when on a phone call/discord/skype only ONE bud would work. These headphones work together or separately, they're 10/10.

The battery life is great too, I charge them for maybe 30 minutes every couple of days. But I'm not too sure on how long the battery life lasts in total, I generally use them at the gym for 2 hours a day, and a couple hours whenever I'm out of the house for shopping.

If you have android, it automatically connects to your phone the moment you close the case and pop them into your ears. Not too sure about iphone since I don't have one.

Regardless if you're using a samsung device or not. If you're using a samsung device the likelihood of sync issue goes away, but you still have connection issues.

I cannot go ~20 minutes before my stationary head at work starts to experience audio skips. I don't move when it start happens and it eventually resolves itself. You can force this to happen by covering both of your ears with your hands and the left should go out. So, when you think about how much of your body is in between your right ear and a phone in your left pocket and you're out of luck. Simply unusable for any amount of time.

if the device is not a samsung device the issue happens and has sync issues. It'll be small at first, you'll hear one clip in the audio and all of a sudden the left earbud is a full second behind so you hear double the audio. There is no way to fix this without taking out both earbuds and placing them back in the case, closing it, waiting 5 seconds, opening it, waiting for it to pair, realize it doesn't automatically pair and you have to delete the previous paring and repair it, then place them back in your ears only to have it happen a couple hours later or the next day. Overall a very bad experience and don't know why this product has such a high rating.

My experience has been using a Surface, Note 8, and Macbook, they all experience the same issue regardless of distance to the buds, even being in line of sight of the device & within 2 ft.

Edit: The replacements suffer the same problem and the update released within the past day (1.35) doesn't fix the issue. It actually made the issue worse. I'm still using my Macbook and the ear (closer to the macbook) will lag and delay itself to make the music in phase. Love it! Now when I cover both of my ears with my hands they both cut out and make awful crackling and static noises that would deafen me if I didn't remove my hands.

Returning my pair and going with a product that at least can play music for more than 5 minutes and of a greater distance than 2 feet.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have a Samsung Note 9 and these Galaxy Buds complement this phone flawlessly. When I place 1 or both buds in my ear(s) even if bluetooth isn't enabled Samsung technology working in true tandem pops up with that Galaxy Buds notification to ask Connect or Cancel. When paired you can use individually Left, Right or both at the same time. When you use the correct rubber ear peices included in the packaging they sound great. It does take a moment to place them and get them in that comfortable position in the ear but that's because these are so tiny and lightweight. Once they are in I forget they are in! The bass is strong, I don't know how you could expect more bass in a ear bud like this, I mean I love bass, I have 2 12"" Memphis subs in my car so I know bass. These have a great balance between bass and treble, just an all around quality sound. These are 100,000x better than those AKG wires headphones that come with Samsung phones like the NOTE 9 and other others. The sound may not be up to BOSE standard but it definitely sounds just like a quality movie theater to me. Quite loud too, I like my music loud and these deliver... maybe a little too well, will be trying to leave these below full volume for my ears sake. Also, the phone calling use with these buds is great. I work in the air on telephone poles and now I can seamlessly switch between music and phone calls with minimal effort. The people on the other end say they hear me great even though it is always windy and blowing right on these ear buds. I can see how if it was noisy like in a large city or event where thousands of people are all yelling around you these may pick up a lot of those voices but like I said it seems like it takes a lot to make phone call quality lack with these. If people like to whisper on the phone or attempt to make a call in a library without disrupting anyone, that might be a little tough because there is a certain low decibel level (normal indoor voice talking volume) these are tuned to work at. I am definitely pleased with these.

My 2 gripes:
1. The case itself is just plastic and I dropped it once, that was it scratched the case right up. Now I have paired this with the araree silicone bean sleeve and I'm good to go for work.

2. These cancel sound so well for tiny ear buds! Which can be a pro or con depending on what you use these for. People used to using Air Pods by Apple might have a tough time adapting to these if they decided to finally do the right thing and switch, lol. Air Pods are a pod style earphone which allows passive sounds to get into your ear along with the music. That open air gap between Air Pod and ear drum can be good and bad. Good if you're using at work and someone comes up behind you and tries to have a full conversation with you while you don't even see they are there. Galaxy Buds cancel outside sounds which can ruin the overall theater-like sound experience when watching movies or listening to music, but obviously makes it tough to hear anyone unless you leave ambient sound on. Ambient sound is a great feature to help with this issue but I think it could still use some improvement.

Overall worth the price and I am very pleased!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I didn't expect them to be this small. I use another brand earbuds which seems too big before Galaxy buds. You know how the craving to use new buds will be. so I tried it extensively over last week. To my surprise, these became my favorites.Now to listen to music and for calls. I kept my other brand earbuds aside. It beats all other brands in size and audio quality. Connecting to Samsung devices was simple, and the calls are audible on both the buds, that's something new. These are small and yet fix perfectly in my ears. Buds never gave any issue connecting to multiple devices. And I tried connecting it to TV. It connected. That's so Cool, right ? Now I can binge watch all my shows without disturbing the house.
Pros:
 --Good for listening to music
--Small enough to fit completely in the ear
--Good charge time and battery life
--There is no ache or pain in the ear if we use it for a long time.
--Doesn't fall off while running or doing jumping jacks.

Con's:
--The buds case is small enough that it can be easily lost.
--Buds need to be properly placed in the case to charge even a small tilt will bring them out
--The case is not scratch resistant
--Not good for Audio calls when outside.

The other day while on was immersed in listening to music at home, My wife came up to and pulled my ear bud out. She was saying 'I have been talking to u and don't you hear me'. I was like I really couldn't hear her while I was listening to music. May be these act as noise cancellation in little.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The main thing is these don't stay in my ears at all, no matter which fins and inserts I use. Next, the fact that you can't customize all of the touch gestures is extremely annoying. These two problems led to me trying to push them further into my ear and constantly pausing my music.  I don't have good luck with these type of earbuds fitting properly. I need to use over the ear headphones apparently, I'll try airpods but I'm not holding out too much hope.

Battery life is not great compared to cheaper options I've tried either.

Also, if you are buying these for the ambient sound feature like I did, then maybe keep looking. It didn't work for me at all. Even with voice focus, it only picked up the loudest noises (dropping weights, and gym screamers). My wife who was 3 feet in front of me talking was muted by my music, so any conversation with someone who spoke quietly or had a higher voice was imperceptible unless I was violating their personal space.

I love that they charge with Qi or USB-C.

These sleek and compact in-ear earbuds are great for music and phone calls in any situation. The convenient carrying and charging case ensures that the buds are charged and protected while not in use. A great feature of the case is that it can be wirelessly charged using a Samsung wireless charging pad. Charging is quite fast and the battery life lasts a long time. The option to connect via USB-C is available as well.

Connecting to a Samsung phone such as a Galaxy Note9 was very easy. The buds were detected and setup was completed in the Galaxy Wearable app and the buds are configured from within. Once the buds are paired, when the case is opened this automatically establishes a connection to the phone. The battery life indicator shows battery level for both the left and right buds as well as options for configuring the number of taps for various functions. The Equalizer has five modes (Bass boost, Soft, Dynamic, Clear, and Treble boost). There was some noticeable difference between these but nothing that was groundbreaking. A nice feature of the Galaxy Wear app is ""Find My Earbuds"". When initiated, each bud makes an audible noise that sounds like birds chirping but makes it relatively easy to find them if they're misplaced.

For the small form factor, these produce clear highs and some deep lows. The bass isn't deep enough to rattle any windows but it's good for the size. The active noise cancelling (ANC) does an OK job of blocking out background noise as long as the volume is turned up to about 60%. This was in an office setting where conversations at normal talking levels are occurring.

All in all, these are very well designed wireless earbuds which produce fantastic sound for all occasions. This fits well with the Samsung brand and is a home run in a small package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Connection: Unlike some other people, I haven't had problems with sound cutting out while the phone is in my pocket. I've even walked into another room and the earbuds work just fine.
Sound Quality: Good not great. If you've already got some fantastic in ear headphones then these will only serve as a convenience, not a replacement.
Ambient Feature: This is another feature that I liked for the convenience factor but the quality isn't that great. If you want to hear something while you have them in, you can activate this feature but it sounds like it's coming through a tin can.
Battery Life: I haven't used a full charge on these things yet. I checked their percentage periodically while in use and they seem to last a long time. I could probably get through a full work day with some breaks in between.
Comfort: You have to rotate the earbuds so that the fin is pointed up. I feel like the left one isnt as snug as the right but I've had that issue with earbuds before. Maybe my left ear canal is slightly bigger than my right. Overall they are very comfy and light.

I do want to complain about one thing though. The charging cable that comes with the case is plastic and maybe 3.5ft long. I think with the price you're paying they should at least offer a higher quality cable. I guess if they wanted to offer a competitive price to Air Pods they had to cut costs somewhere, right?","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Noticeable video delay. Disappointing experience","July 14, 2019","Pros: Price. Sound quality. Design and look. Style and compact size.
Cons: Uncomfortable fit. Noticeable latency in video/audio sync. Missing features with iPhone. Easy to mistakenly activate touch features.

I really wanted to like these. I did extensive research before settling on these. I read most review articles and watched many of the available pre-release video reviews on Youtube. I was comfortable dealing with the iPhone compatibility limitation but was ultimately disappointed with the discomfort of the fit. I tried to deal with it for a few weeks but decided to return them in the end.

The fit wasn't the only issue. The latency/delay of audio with video was too much to deal with. I mostly use Youtube, and while on my commute, my viewing experience was unenjoyable. Anything involving precise action or comedic punchline was virtually unwatchable. I had a $6 pair of Bluetooth in-ear headphones that had better latency than these, so I was very disappointed.

Using an iPhone significantly limits your experience. Upon researching, I was willing to try these with the missing features, but it seems crazy that with all the available apps, Samsung couldn't come up with an iPhone app to allow you at least some of the features (at the time of purchase there was nothing available - not sure what the current app features may be).  Because of this, I can't speak to the functionality of the ambient noise control feature.

Another annoyance was the touch controls. The earbuds are very small (a good thing), so there is limited space for you to handle them. Half the time I was handling them to put them in my ear, I would activate something by accident. Or if I needed to reposition or adjust placement in my ear, it was activate something unintentionally.

If you have bigger ears and a Samsung/Android phone, you'll probably love these. As an iPhone user with small ears, these were no good.

I decided to go with the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air earphones. They kind of look like Airpods, but with soft buds. They fit comfortably and have great battery life for almost half the price. I recommend these as an alternative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'm using them with an iPhone 8 Plus and there are some minor problems though. Can't get the app for customizing the buds, oh well. But I can't watch YouTube videos while using these as there is a significant latency issue, meaning the audio is out of sync with the video. So far that's the only time I've notice this as Netflix and such seem to be just fine. I can only change volume on my phone which isn't too bad as I can easily hit my volume buttons while my phone is still in my pocket. I've occasionally had an issue with them not connecting when I take them out and have to put them back in the case and out again but it's rare. But they have great audio quality, and they fit great thanks to the different wing and ear tip options that come with them. I like being able to have the touch options for pause/play, skip, back and even siri control with a press and hold.

I was preparing to buy another set, but realized that the new Earbuds had just been released.  As with the 2018 Iconx, they were really easy to connect without issue.

In comparison to the 2018 IconX, the chargin/carrying case is noticeably smaller & lighter, which i definitely appreciate when putting them into my pants pocket.  The case still feels very solid.  In addition to the case being smaller, it feels as if the actual earbuds are slightly smaller and lighter.  I don't notice them in my ear, and yet, they definitely feel secure (not as if they are going to fall out.  This wasn't an issue with the 2018 Iconx either).

The sound seems to be the same (excellent) with good bass and maybe a bit louder than the 2018.  I had found the 2018s were also really good at noise cancellation and so are these.  Note that to change the bass and treble options (as well as other options), you need to download the Galaxy Wear app to your phone.

Definitely happy with my purchase!

I'd live with that but the disconnects while running are unacceptable. For what it's worth, my first pair of buds come up as BC33 in my bluetooth settings and the second as C335; I was hopeful that the latter would be an improvement but so far it really isn't.

UPDATE: Outdoors, these connects regularly but randomly in both the crowded city and alone by the waterfront; also, the left and right buds, used separately, both disconnect, i.e. there's no improvement if one is ""closer"" to the phone, which is in my jacket pocket.

VERDICT: Unacceptable.

And I mean that literally; it came like the first pic, open, in the box. The buds were also clearly used by someone that doesn't value personal hygiene as much as I do.

The rating system is pretty mediocre so I'll leave it with what it deserves. Ever since I got my free pair of these with my S10+ I have cut the cord. This may vary depending on your particular situation but I use these at least 30hrs a week at my job and the convenience is impossible to beat. So this is where I'm coming from.

The sound quality, like, wow. Really impressed with these.

You can't beat a wired pair. You just can't. I have a pair of FH5's and Sure 846's. The extra power (amps, wattage) they can inherently provide beats out anything currently available. In the end they all use similar drivers; it's the execution and the end result that matters and for a truly wireless set, I'm waiting for something to beat these...

This, for me at least, is the beginning of the truly wireless age.

EDIT: I got these replaced obviously and Amazon sent me yet another open and clearly used item. Was also someone with gross ears. I wouldn't reccomend buying these from Amazon. Two in a row shows that they are clearly, intentionally, restocking returned/used items as new and reselling them as such.

The pros:
- Decent sound quality; you can switch the codec to scalable in the dev options and it makes somewhat of a difference. as for sound and noise, people say that it is too quiet, don't believe them, they don't know how to work it. You have to change the touch options to when you hold down it will make the volume up, as the headphones have a separate volume than the phone does.
- Excellent noice cancelling; when you put them in your ears, you cant hear people talking around you, especially when music is playing. I have to take them out to talk to people because of how good it is. I've asked people around me if they can hear my blasting music and they say they can't hear a thing so that's good.

In the middle:
- The fit; they have adjustable earpieces in them and you can change them according to your ear size. after a while you start to feel the effect of the wing, but after getting used to wearing them for a day, they don't hurt like they did. I can now wear them for long periods of time without anything hurting. it's just a matter of getting used to it. they also have great bass isolation, just adding that in there.
- The look; I have a small head and I was really sceptical about getting these considering how big they actually are. I got them, and they don't look half bad. they look like they has a price on them when you wear them, like airpods do. They fit in my ears without me looking rediculise.

The cons:
- The only thing I have found to dislike about them is that you can feel that your wearing them. I had a pair of Bose soundsport and when you wear them, you couldnt feel them and it was like it was playing around you but then you'd look and no one was jamming to the music! 10/10 recommend those btw but keep in mind they hurt your ears lot after (it's worth the pain for the sound quality). Sorry went of on a tangent.. The buds let you know how heavy they are (not a lot,but more than others).

out of all I give them about a 8/10. Hope this helps your purchase!

They frequently cut out when playing music for no apparent reason. The volume is set very low at the factory and the only way to increase it is through the phone.  I do not like to max out the volume on the phone, but have no other choice except to do that when listening in a noisy environment such as on the street.  They do not cancel out noise very well. I have tried different ear bud tips and none seem to seal well enough to block out the noise. The microphone is not very good either. The person on the other end of the call thought I had my hand over the microphone. They could hear me, but barely.  I called Samsung and explained what I was experiencing and they said I got a defective pair and that I should call Amazon and ask for a replacement pair sent out.  That pair is on the way.  I hope all of the issues mentioned above will be resolved with the new pair.  We shall see.  I will update this review once I get the new pair and try them for a spell.  If things do not change, they will go back to Amazon for a refund.  I will go back to my $50 pair that sound better, do not cut out as frequently, and make better calls.  The only drawback to them over the Samsung is the battery life is shorter, about half as long. 5/24 Update:  The replacement pair had fewer problems. but still cut out when playing music, so they were returned and I get a refund.  I will go back to my $50 Ikanzis and I have ordered another pair so I can have longer listening time. When one pair needs to be charged, I will simply use the other pair.  Even though I bought two pair, their total cost is less than one pair of Samsungs.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Here are my reservations:
1. The control buttons on the buds are easily activate just by touching either bud when inserting or removing from ears, activating different functions.
2. Range of Bluetooth is very short compare to all other buds I own.
3. Erratic behavior - I am not sure how to explain this but it's like watching 3D without glasses, 2 independent sounds coming out.
4. Screeching noise coming out of the left side. I had to leave the left bud in the car when I went to the gym.
5. The ambient noise sounds like you are in the toilet, and wind sound makes it worst.
6. Callers complaint on quality of the call.

They have been updated to the latest firmware.

I have until the end of May to return the earbuds and right now I am incline to do that. I am going to start searching for replacements. If only the Jabra had magnetic case to hold buds in place, I would repurchase those.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sound quality is fantastic, but it can be subjective since I am not an audiophile everyone has different opinions. But in all honesty, they sound great, make sure you download the Galaxy wearable app that way you can tune the quality to your liking, I am a bass head so I have it on Bass Boost...

Bluetooth is solid, really good has incredible range, literally, I walked at least 50 close to 70 feet away from my phone and the connection remained strong, it started cutting out when I went further than that. So yes most of the effort definitely went for Bluetooth connectivity very reliable even with phone in pocket, and as soon as you open your pill case they start connecting immediately, not bad Samsung not bad at all....

so why only three stars you ask?

 Let me start off by saying that this review is not meant to sway you off your purchase, these are great you do get your money's worth, but, don't rely on it for phone calls. Phone calls are a hit and miss some people hear me nice and clear others have told me that i'm either too quiet or it sounds slur-ish, it works best in quiet places especially with both earbuds, the earbuds can work independently as well so you can use either the right ear bud only or the left it really doesn't matter. Voice assistant works too, if you say ok/hey google it will pop up, however, it doesn't always work and sometimes it cannot understand you, I find it best if you just change the tap-hold button for assistant but again sometimes it wont understand what you are trying to say to it, either bad mic quality or earbud design ...

But then here comes my second gripe, the touch controls on these are pretty frustrating, they are very sensitive for sure, single tap and tap-hold work just fine but double tap and triple tap are very annoying at times, they would register some times as a single tap, or a triple tap it gets confused, most of the time I just end up whipping out my phone to change tracks. I'm pretty sure this can be fixed with an update, you can change tap-hold to something else and you can also lock out the touch controls, but it locks out all of them, why? why not just lockout some of them not all of them at once? Also give us the ability to modify our tap controls any way we want, why is it limited to only tap-hold? it makes no sense Samsung, get on this man....

Overall, if you don't mind changing tracks with your phone, and you just want to listen to music these work great you wont be disappointed, but these small bugs need to be fixed, never tested the wireless charging ability since I do not have a wireless charging pad but I assume it works....","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound quality is very good for an ear bud. While it cannot match the bass and overall sound of a large over ear style headphone, these buds do a great job in a small package. As far as comfort, I have no complaints. They sit nicely in your ear and come with a few size options for the little wing tip that locks it in place. Even while sweating a lot at the gym and moving around a lot I have never had them fall out. The battery life is great, I haven't actually had them die on me yet because any time I'm not using them I put them back in their charging case and they get charged back up to full battery very quickly. I try to remember to charge the case for a little while every day and that has been enough to support using them for a few hours each day at work and also at the gym. The case is small and convenient to carry around, but a little slippery so I have accidentally dropped it or had it fall out of my pocket while grabbing my keys a couple times (and everything still works fine). The only reason I would not recommend these to someone would be if their primary use will be for calls. It seems like the other person has a little trouble hearing me when I talk, but I really don't make many calls with them so that is a not a priority for me. The ambient noise feature works decently if your music is at low volume. It is enough to hear your surroundings while walking indoors, but not great to have a full conversation and if you are outside, it picks up a lot of wind sound making it rather useless. Overall I would definitely recommend these ear buds to anyone with a Samsung phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However, they are awesome for music quality.  You can use one earbuds while the other is charging in the case.  That case has an internal battery that you can charge and whenever you put your earphone away they will charge with the built in battery that's in the case.  The case has two LED lights.  One light is internal and the other is external.  The LED colors are green, yellow and red.  I also love the size of the case.  I thought the earbuds would hurt my ears after hours of use but they are comfortable and they do not fall off.  If you happen to misplace your earbuds the app on your phone, ""Galaxy Wearable"" can find your earbuds.  The earbuds make a chirping sound to locate your misplaced earbuds.  You can also charge these earbuds with, ""Wireless Powershare"" with your phone or any other wireless charging device.

I've been using my Level U for like two years but I've finally lost all of the rubber earbud covers and they're falling apart anyways so I decided it was time to buy some new ones.

It was decidedly easy to buy these as they are some of the cheapest truly wireless earbuds by a major technologies company out there (I've had mixed success buying off-brand earbuds) and I already have a Samsung phone so I thought it would just work out better. FYI It did!

It's so great to not mess with wires anymore but the one earbud at a time feature is another plus. I know that one of the major complaints is the sound quality, but I haven't seen many issues with it. For $130 the sound is incredible with decent bass. I think some people may expect Harman Kardon or Sennheiser level quality but then go out and buy one of their products then!

You will definitely notice these sit in your ear but with the different sized rubber rings and earpieces, it shouldn't be uncomfortable. That's the tradeoff for the tight fitting secure fit I guess. It does an amazing job canceling out external sound when both are in. One note is that the ambient sound feature does sound tinny in a smaller room because it picks up everything and does leave something to be desired.

Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and can't wait to try them out on a run now that the weather is nice again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I had to install an app on my Pixel 3 XL, which then prompted me to install another plugin (could be better). Still, this took overall just about a minute.

The audio quality is great, although turning off ambient noise made it considerably worse. I don't know why that is, but leaving ambient noise on and setting its volume to zero left me with great sound.

The reason why I'm giving the Buds 2 stars, and why I'll ultimately return them, is the quality of the microphone. I simply cannot use them for calls, either on my Pixel 3 XL (regular phone call or Skype) or on my Surface Book (and Skype). While I have no problem hearing the other person, they can barely hear me. This is not an issue with the signal quality, as I don't have the problem with AirPods or via USB-C headphones with microphone.

I don't have huge demands on the microphones: it's obvious that one shouldn't use them to record a podcast. But having a conversation on a call is not a cutting edge feature and I'm completely perplexed why the microphone is so poor that this is not feasible. I initially thought I might just have a defect pair of Buds, but googling the issue specifically returned a number of reviews raising the same issue.

It's really a shame: they are otherwise well worth the money. But making calls isn't exactly a fringe use of headphones like these...","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The only thing I really dislike is that all the customizable options are only available through the Samsung wearable app and while the buds work perfectly with my iPad and laptop like any other Bluetooth headphones, I really do wish I could use the ambient mode and equalizer as well. Otherwise, if you don’t care about these settings, it has been a very solid purchase. Battery is very very good, and, though not officially noise cancelling, they do nest in your ears in a way that it feels like noise cancelling as only really loud sound gets through. Ambient noise, doesn’t. Though, when walking with them, you do listen and feel the steps, and it takes time to adjust. Same goes with the buds overall.

If someone could find a way to merge these two products, I would be much happier.

The good:
-Battery life is actually quite good. I have yet to have the battery level warn me it was low, despite heavy use.
-You can use either headphone solo or together. A limitation of the Bose Soundsport Free is you need to use the right headphone, but cannot use the left headphone solo. The Samsung wins on that one feature.
- The charging case is small, easy to toss in a pocket and not notice. The case charges the headphones quickly.
-The ""find my earbud"" feature is excellent. It makes a loud chirping sound that is easy to hear across the room. The only way to improve it would be to add a sharp finish to the sound  at the end to help your ear focus on location.
-The profile when wearing it is the best I have seen on a completely wireless headphones. They fit snugly and have lots of sizing options.

The Bad
-They have an very limited range. Maybe 15' with clear line of sight.  Putting my phone in my left pocket while using only the right earbud leads to a choppy signal, at best. With the Bose, I can go 35' away with walls between my phone and the earbud and have clear, crisp sound. The shorter distance with the reception is probably something that helps the battery life on the Samsung over the Bose, but can be irritating.
-The sound quality is mediocre. Especially compared to the Bose. Acceptable for the gym and most activities, but if you are an audiophile, you will be frustrated with the sound quality.

Summary-
Solid package. I use them more than the Bose. The case is smaller, the individual earbuds can be used independently of the other, and the battery life if much better. The earphone block noise well, are intuitive, and fit well. The signal strength leaves A LOT to be desired. It is my biggest gripe, but not a deal breaker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Features: The touch sensor on the device gets a little getting use to, but once you have the figuration set to your liking it very easy.  The pill box case is light and easily placed in a pocket, going to purchase a sleeve with a clip for it so i can have on my belt instead.
Sound: Great quality on the sound, once ear buds are in they pretty much cancel most of the background noise and the bass and clarity of what you are hearing is amazing.
Call quality: Now here is what makes the score drop. So when people call me I can hear them with such great clarity, however in most cases that can't be said about me.

Upon receiving the Galaxy Buds I was really excited, small earbuds, usb c/wireless charging, great sound quality, they seemed like the whole package. Unfortunately after using them for more than an hour I proceeded to get light headed. I thought, ""Hey you're probably just tired."" but after trying them out for a few days now the same thing happens each time I use them. I was reading up on it and apparently I fall into the small percentage of people who get motion sickness due to the noise isolation and in ear rubber tip.

Extra pieces are included which allows you to customize the Galaxy Buds to your ear. You have 12 different ear shape/size combinations! The ambient noise mode helps out, greatly, but it not very useful with your music turned all of the way up, which is expected.
One thing to note is that talking on the phone with heavy wind causes the person on the other end to hear it for sure, but that is expected with most bluetooth earpieces that do not have a foam cover on the microphone.

I gave it 3 stars on mostly sound quality and fit. The sound is nice for a room setting and/or no so loud public places. The fitment was ok and you have to get use to it bc it feels awkward at first. Aside from that it always feels like it's going to fall out with a little bit of sweat. I never had enough confidence on fit and I'm always having to readjust them. Maybe it's just me. Ambient sound adjustment is nice to have and it works, and you need to have SamsungWear app to use it.  Overall they are good.

But they are more secure than airpods. I ended getting these after returning my airpods because I couldn't get the most out of the airpods from a Samsung device and I must say I'm happier. I'd recommend trying all of the wing tips and ear tips to find your fit before you decide that they aren't for you. My only concern is the battery case only gives you 7 more hours as opposed to the airpods 24 hours.. CMON MAN THATS RIDICULOUS. Touch controls work great actually, work better than the airpods touch controls and more options per bud too. Really these are better than airpods in every way other than the case's battery life. Cheaper too. Also note that the wing tips may cause some pain in your ear after an hour of wearing them or so, so keep that in mind. It doesn't bother me so much but this can be a deal breaker for most. So comfort is more of a 2 out of 5 star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

If you plan on using these for actual conversation though...NO. stay away. When talking on the phone, (if one of the buds isn't  just randomly dead that is ) the other person can barely hear you. At first I thought maybe it's them, but I decided to download a call recording app and it's terrible. The battery life, last maybe 3 hours then you hear beeping and its time to recharge.

As a previous owner of the Iconx 2018, I was expecting some of the same feature passed down. For instance, on the Iconx 2018, you could set the main earbud to left or right. This was handy when running with my Garmin. Connection issues happen when the main earbud is set to the opposite ear of the arm your watch is own. So the watch is on your left arm and main bud is in your eight ear. This causes the connection to drop out continuously. This is something great the Iconx had. You could change it to any ear. This feature is lost to the Galaxy Buds. I have to change the watch to my opposite arm to combat this, and it's quite awkward

The biggest let down was they had no internal storage. This was very disappointing, as this was my favorite feature on the Iconx. I understand they wanted to cut the size down but they took away what made the Iconx so great.

I haven't decided whether I want to return them or not. If someone can tell me how to set the main earbud or get around this, I'll change my review. This doesn't mean telling me to move my watch to the other arm.","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I've tried so many others but they all had various issues and the worst being people did not understand me when I was speaking on the phone especially when the batteries were low.  I love that you can use these as a pair or use thr right or left ear bud by itself. You can take them in and out of your ear without disconnecting the call. The sound quality is good but I wish it was a little louder but this would possibly damage your hearing so where it is works. It also has a nice feature that alerts you when thr battery is low and needs to be charged. The charging cradle does a fine job of giving you additional power on the run. The cradle also has a longer charging cable than all the others I've tried. There's also a handy app that you install for these earbuds that also lets you know the battery life in percentages. Another thing I love is the ease of paring these and the ease of them connecting with Bluetooth whether it is on a mobile device or with the hands-free module in my car. Finally, the earbuds are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.

My earbuds have pretty annoying connectivity issues with the Bluetooth dongle I have for my PC, but I'm going to try a different dongle before I judge them on that.
If your planning on watching many TV/Movies with them I would pass. They have some of the highest latency of all the wireless earbuds at 320ms and they don't feature the aptX low latency audio codec (unless you're exclusively streaming from a Samsung phone which apparently uses a lower latency audio codec). This translates to a very noticeable delay between peoples lips and the actual sound.
The earbuds are relatively comfortable. After 4-5 hours of having them in I do sometimes experience enough discomfort that it's obnoxious. Oddly enough, smiling or laughing while they're in can be pretty uncomfortable.

I would only recommend these if you're planning on using them exclusively (or at least mainly) for music during a workout or listening to podcasts around the house.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I ordered them as soon as I could. But after having them for a week I am not as impressed as I hoped I would be. That being said I will be keeping them.

Pros
- Comfort,  these are extremely comfortable in my ears.
- Sound quality,  these buds sound great and have good bass. I love how they seal in my ears to block out other sounds when I really want to jam out
- Battery life/charging case,  they seem to live up to the 6 hour life and i like that i can put them back in the case to get some extra charge.
- Wearable app,  easy to navigate and like i can change some of the tap gestures.

Cons
- The ear buds occasionally have gone out of sync requiring me to remove one bud and putting it back  my ear so they are synced together.
- Ambiant sound mode automatically turns off when you remove one ear bud and you have to go back into the app to turn it back on. I have the long tap gesture set to volume so I can't turn it back on that way.
- I expected more out of ambiant sound mode. I bought these for going to the gym hoping that I could have a conversation with my wife and still listen to music. I can do this without having to remove a bud but do have to pause my music to hear her.
-  Blue tooth,  this issue I think is with my Galaxy S8 but cannot confirm. When I am outside I cannot put my phone in my pocket or swing my arms when walking as the connection drops in and out.

Overall I am happy enough with them to keep them but for $130 I expected a lot more from them and am kind of disappointed. Hopefully some of these issues can be fixed with firmware updates.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've had them got A day and so far I'm pretty impressed honestly. I didn't have the gear iconx or whatever the predecessors to these were. I went for a decent length walk yesterday with Lots of stuff in my pockets along with my phone and had minimal sputtering, by that I mean once. The buds never came out of sync with one another fortunately as I had also read.
These buds are super immersive with their sound and I really like the quality of the sound, very full but the bass could be a little fuller, but its still pretty good, especially for wireless headphones.
The call quality for me was fine, not stellar, but when I got a call yesterday on my walk, I answered the call with my buds and left the phone in my pocket and kept walking and the call went smoothly. I was walking along a busy street and the person on the other end had no issues hearing me.
The down side wasn't on part of the buds, but amazon really. I didn't appreciate this, ""free one day shipping"" then my package didn't get to me causing me to have to go to the post office the next day and the told me that the package had just come in right before I got there. Amazon told me that my Apt wasn't accessable and told me that's why my package wasn't delivered.

After a few days I realized these things are not falling out, unless of course they are directly hit. I used the Beats X before these and the sound on Beats are very loud, that being said Galaxy Buds could use one or two more notches on the volume up button. They could be louder for me since I work in a noisey place, but they get the job done listening to Howard Stern everyday at work (BABABOOEY TO Y'ALL). For example if your on say a riding lawnmower these won't work at all sound wise, I use my OVER ear beats in that situation. These are snug, very sharp looking, and well worth the $125 price tag. Battery last all day during my 8-10hr workday, if you're not using em throw them in the case so they can charge wirelessly another great feature.

It's not ideal for dedicated music consumption. There are alternatives such as the soundpeats that offer much better audio quality, however with any other smaller brands they're limited in functionality or practicality.

Like the Airpods, these buds allow for single side use and gestures. Cheaper alternatives require some awkward fumbling to pause the music or worse pushing a button on the ear piece--this drives the ear piece into your ear and needless to say, it kind of hurts/uncomfortable.

Using this with Spotify premium (Android), I had to tweak the equalizer settings to get a comfortable listening experience without cracking the highs and the lows were kind of muted. Regardless, it's underwhelming coming from a wired experience.

Who would I recommend this to? If you like Airpods but you use an android device... Better yet if you own a Samsung device, without a doubt this provides the best listening experience. I'm not sure if it's intentional or not, it sounds and works twice as good/well than on my Pixel 3 XL.

I have had the IconX's for about a year now. So let me run though my list.

1. This is easily the best part of these buds: they are SUPER COMFORTABLE! I almost can't even tell they are there. I have been wearing them for hours (part of that time with a beanie on and part without). They are simply a joy to wear. A big upgrade from the IconX comfort which plenty to be desired. Also the fit on these exceed the IconX. I have a weird left ear canal and shape and never could get the IconX's quite right but the galaxy buds work perfectly. So if fit and comfort are the most important things to you then I highly recommend these.

2. Sound Quality - It's about the same as the IconX's despite being ""tuned"" by AKG. Volume is roughly the same. If the IconX's volume got an 8, I would say the galaxy buds get to 7.75. Bass is good enough as is treble. The mids are alright too; I'm not a huge audiophile but they sound very nice.

3. Noise Isolation - top notch; they filter out sound quite well. I will say the ambient sound feature on them is CRAP compared to the IconX's; the IconX's ambient sound was much better. If you care about that sort of thing.

4. Touch Response - its very touchy. If you press too quick it'll only register the first tap. So you have to slow down a bit and I don't like that cause the IconX's didn't need that. Plus remember that they removed the swipe up/down for volume controls (which I hate that they did that) so you are stuck with a tap and hold (right bud does volume up and left does volume down and NOPE you cannot remap this).

5. Software - IconX is winner here. They removed the tap and hold and it would cycle through your list of available options (like ambient sound on/off, voice command, start workout, etc) but as mentioned above they removed the swipe for volume. This is a huge step back Samsung.

6. Connectivity - I keep my phone in my front left pocket and my IconX's would very rarely disconnect/crackle for a moment or two. The Galaxy buds do it every single time I turn my head in any direction. I moved my phone to my jacket pocket and that essentially fixed it. That isn't viable for year round though; I hope Samsung fixes this with a software update as this is crap.

7. Battery - it's fine; but overall the IconX's would last longer in the long run as its case held more of a charge. However, the wireless charging case is nice. But I was fine with just the wired USB-C charging of the IconX's.

8. Long term frustrations - I cannot say as I haven't had the buds very long however the IconX's had this super annoying problem where ear wax would sneak its way into the canal of the bud and block most sound. You had to take off the screen, clean the canal, and replace with a new screen (thankfully supplied by Samsung in abundance). I don't think the GB's will have this issue but that remains to be seen. They don't include a repair kit with these so I'm assuming they don't expect it to happen.

9. They removed the internal 4gb of storage. Why Samsung, I used the heck out of that. I love going out for a run/jog and not have to take my phone OR smartwatch. I would pay for that; I think others would too.

With the removal of the volume swipe, the tap and hold scroll through list, lesser battery and sound that isn't any better than last year's model I'd have a hard time recommending these over the IconX model. The comfort, fit, smaller size, wireless charging case, and multiple color options are about the only things the new buds have going for them. I love Samsung products but this one isn't as good as I hoped it would be. It isn't bad either. YMMV.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Greatly improved design for sure. Much better fit and amazingly light weight. No discomfort after long term use. Which brings me to the point that long term use is possible with not only amazing battery life but the multiple convenient charging options. From the additional charge ability of the case itself, to wireless charging off your phone or pad, to simply plugging it in to the same usb C your phone uses. Sound quality is quite impressive for the compact size. Easy to adjust EQ levels create a great sound of your preference. Bass comes thru great without sacrificing clarity like other earbuds might. Call quality has been the most impressive. My callers cant even tell I'm using a headset. The noise cancelling has definitely improved in this model. ""Quick Ambient"" is probably my favorite new feature. with just a touch of one ear you can engage external mic and hear all around you. such a simple yet handy feature.

These are not for hands free talking. You will be able to hear your caller just fine. The sound on your end is great. However, your caller will be able to hear every single sound and noise in your background including hearing you swallow if you take a drink. Lol. They will not be able to make out what you're saying. I have not had one successful call with these. I was walking around the mall, I answered my friend's call. She could instantly tell something was off and different. My friend asked me what kind of 2003 Bluetooth device did I get and that I should throw them in the trash. And she wasn't the only call I've answered and my caller was like ""please disconnect me from your Bluetooth device"". So... Not for hands free talking. At. All.

Sound Quality - The sound, 5 out of 5. Beautiful sound quality. There's an equalizer with different options. I love the bass. It's very easy to become immersed in what you are listening to.

Noise Cancellation - These are ONLY for listening and possibly noise cancellation if you need it. The noise cancellation is 5 out 5. It actually concerned me at first because I couldn't hear ANYTHING in my surroundings. The ambient option helps you to be aware of your surroundings, other than that, be careful and be alert.

Battery - no complaints. It has always later as long as I needed. And when I'm not using them, I put it back in the case and it's at 100% again. 5 out of 5.

Bluetooth Connection - 4 out of 5. I'm not sure if it's the range, the walls, or when the battery gets low, but it makes this awful digital scrambling sound when the Bluetooth connection is breaking up. My apartment is a little less than 800 sqft. My phone can be in the living room, if I walk in the closet, the sound will scramble. I rated it 4 and not 3 because of the effortless connection. Just open the case and it automatically pairs to the phone. I have a Note 8.

Charging case - 5 out of 5. It's very small. I have clumsy hands so I have dropped it and lost it several times. Lol. That's a me problem though. It has the same c-type USB charging port. Super convenient.

Other functions - 4 out of 5. If you drop an earbud and can't find it. Click on where's my earbud and it will begin to beep louder and louder. I wish it did that for the whole case. The tapping functions to turn volume up or answer call (it's customizable) are fine. No real issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The mic is also garbage, something I was embarrassed to discover while attempting to conduct a business call. I've attempted all of the recommended troubleshooting techniques and it's never improved.

I'd like to start off by saying the Samsung Galaxy Buds functionality review is #2 here and is separate from the main point.

#1: Nastiest package from Amazon ever. These buds came Very USED condition with oils and ear wax crusted to the device and charge container. Bought to use before going on a trip making it pointless to return at the time. Should have paid considerably less for having to sanitize them. Minor scratches on package after finding items were scattered, fully apart, thrown around in large shipping box.
Possibly the most disappointed I've been for conditions of a shipment in years. (4k picture uploaded, apologies for grossness)

#2: Samsung Galaxy Buds functionality: Still quite the upgrade from the first bluetooth set produced from Samsung. The size is perfect for small ears and has sizing to adjust for larger. Range is massive, best upgraded feature imo aside from size reduction.

Will update if new opinions.

In terms of design, they far exceeded my expectations.  At about $30 cheaper than AirPods, I actually prefer the design of the case and earbuds Samsung offers.  The soft rim and earpiece come in 3 sizes each, and I found that after swapping to the smallest, they fit snug but are comfortable for hours. I have run in them without any need to adjust them at all, a first for me with any headphone or earbud.  The touchpads on the earbuds are easy to use and one function is programmable.  The case is tiny... smaller than the AirPod case or any I have ever seen.  The bottom allows for wireless charging, a nice feature, but they do come with a high quality USB-C charger.  The earbuds rest in the case with magnets securely.

In terms of quality, the fit & finish is comparable to every Apple product I have ever purchased - high praise for sure.  The earbuds are very light, but sturdy.  They connect automatically after one seamless setup process (much easier than any other Bluetooth experience I've had) once you take them out of the case.

Regarding battery life, Samsung claims 6 hours, but I haven't had to push it nearly that far.  I have found after 3+ hours half-volume listening from full charge the earbuds are generally around 60%.  I firmly believe the battery life drawback is a sacrifice for the smaller case, which I'd rather lose personally.

All things considered, these are excellent ""truly wireless"" earbuds, I highly recommend them, especially if you have a Samsung phone.  If you travel often or want to put them in your pocket, these have the smallest case yet. Battery life is reasonable but not near first-class, and the overall design and build quality are excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The one feature i wish worked better was the passthrough audio.  It's not great.

Great battery life, and multi-feature button is great.","October 27, 2019","I wanted headphones that I could wear to the gym and not need a wire attached to my phone or even around the back of my neck. A friend had these and I knew I had to try them.

They do not fall out. I can run, jump, accidentally hit myself in the head with a rake, they don't go anywhere. The battery lasts and lasts and they charge very quickly when it finally runs out. And the case is convenient to carry around without needing a ton of space.

As much as I enjoy trying to blow out my ear drums and ruin my hearing, these just don't quite do it but are plenty loud enough. The sound quality is quite good, but you won't get a whole lot of bass simply due to how small these things are.

The only word of caution I would give is for people with in-ear piercings. I have a daith, which sometimes gets a little uncomfortable with the earbud after several hours of wear, and that earbud will often discharge a little faster because it occasionally contacts the metal of my earring. But it's hardly enough to annoy me, they're great earbuds.

Sometimes people don't notice I'm wearing them, which can be fun when they start talking and it seems I'm ignoring them, but hey, the noise cancelling works really well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've previously owned the jaybird x2's and jaybird freedom but these are my go-to headphones for working out! They fit well and dont fall out of the ear even during sternous exercises. They include different sizes of ear tips to ensure a proper fit for most ears. Connectivity was simple! If you have a newer samsung phone, all you need to do is flip the lid open to the galaxy bud case and the phone detects them itself and asks if youd like to connect. If you have an Apple phone, you have to go in to your settings and manually pair the ear buds after opening the case. The best part is, you can choose to use only 1 earbud at a time! The sound quality is good after being tweaked using Samsung's equalizer. So far, I haven't needed to charge my buds as the case charges them back to 100% everytime I put them in.

When idle or when walking it's usually fine, but if I take these out for a run, or want to do chores around the house I have to fit my phone to a wrist mount or place it somewhere on high. They *definitely* sacrificed range on these.

That being said, the bass is nice and the highs and mids are crisp. Microphone works well, but seems to have intermittent connection issues for the above mentioned reasons. I didn't have to use any of the alternate sizes of earbud or wingtip to get a nice snug fit. You can tell them R&D'd the crap out of the twist-in design, you get a perfect seal everytime. The hear through function is basically necessary, even with only one earbud in, if you're gonna talk to someone. The use of touch controls is very welcome, as previous ""true wireless"" earbuds that had physical buttons always felt like plunging my ear whenever they were pressed. The tap is sometimes unresponsive, but you learn quickly that there's a sweet spot that needs to be hit. Still annoying that occasionally you have to try three or four times when out on a run, and it looks a little silly. I tend to use the pause and long press for assistant functions exclusively (it's not that hard to pull out your phone lol)

The fact that each bud can be used independently is really neat, but not without flaws. Occasionally when watching video one of the two buds will lag behind the other and there's a jarring distortion that you can't really ignore. Rarely, one of the buds will not connect when switching from single to dual, and won't respond until you put it back in the charging case and then take it back out. It's never persisted past that initial reset, so I'm not exactly taking any points off for that.

The battery life is adequate, the time to charge is not all that great but not at all bad. About 3 hours of nonstop use, at full volume; roughly an hour to charge the whole case, and roughly an hour to charge a bud back to full power. If you wanted to, it's perfectly feasible to use one at a time for ~12 hours of uninterrupted use. The ""in ear, in use"" sensor works fairly well, but lags quite a bit when taking the buds out before disabling the touch controls. It's more for battery preservation than anything else.

There's a lot of confusion online about the samsung app that goes along with these earbuds. *you do not need to install anything to get these to work*. The main reason one would *need* to install the samsung app is if you wanted to fine tune the use of the hear through function, which can be set once and then the app uninstalled.

at ~140 I'd put these a fair cut above the competition, Jabra's offerings are over priced and I dont even wanna start with apple earbuds (they're basically expensive trash by comparison). Despite the persistent issues I have with connection I wont be returning these, I consider that an unavoidable burden with tech this small. I would (and have) recommend(ed) these to a friend, but like it says in the title here, be aware if you are larger in frame.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have my hair parted to the side and that means I can use one of them at a time and listen to music at work without anyone noticing at all because my hair covers my right ear. The sound quality really is good. Definitely not like stock earphones at all. Not as great as a full on headset, but you hardly notice any dip in quality and you get amazing portability with it. I can't comment on the battery life just yet but I will likely update this with that info after a week, although I have a portable charger just in case. Also, it ships with a USB-C cable in the box so don't worry about purchasing that seperately. Very satisfied with my purchase.

EDIT: May 20th; The battery life actually isn't that bad. I haven't had to recharge them with my portable charger even once. They charge in the case about 3 1/2 times for me and they each lasted about 5 hours, although I do only use one sometimes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They kept falling out of my ears.  I replaced them with these and the Galaxy Buds fit much better.  I still prefer the fit of Bose ""Stayhears,"" but the little fins on these are pretty good!

I was surprised to find that even though the overall weight of these and the Jabras are very close, it is distributed differently.  I tried many different aftermarket tips but these just work better for me and I feel less fatigue/irritation. It all depends on the fit for your ears.

The sound quality is decent once you find the right tips that isolate the sound in your ear canal.  Not nearly as good as wired earbuds.  My bose QC30s blueooth buds have significantly better sound but they require you wear the collar. These are much less constraining.

The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the very limited flexibility in what the earpads do when you tap them. You can't change the built-in function for single, double and triple taps.  All you can set is what happens when you touch and hold each earpad.

I wanted to be able to adjust volume up and down plus have a way to access Google Assistant/Siri.  Unfortunately, you can't do them all. If you pick volume up for one of the volume controls, the other is automatically set to volume down.  If you choose Siri, you can't do volume with the other ear, it has to be set to affect ambient sound, which isn't useful for me.

All in all, nice wireless earbuds at a better price than the Jabras.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Shutes","Decent Sound, Absysmal Call Quality","November 14, 2019","I live in Nashville and we're no longer able to hold our mobile phones while driving.  I bought these - as a longtime Samsung / Android owner - to go with my Galaxy S10.

First of all, if you just want earbuds for the gym, these still aren't great.  I had them fall out of my ears while lifting on a couple occasions.  Getting the fit and placement makes a huge impact on sound and it took me a few tries to even get that right.

The call quality is just simply not there.  I have better luck on speakerphone in my Jeep than I do attempting conversation on the Galaxy Buds.  I live in a city.  It's not that I have bad cell reception.

Sorry, Samsung.  Try again.  In the meantime, it's back to the drawing board for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've recently taken an interest in other Samsung products besides smart phones. My Beats bluetooth headphones got lost so I went searching for a new pair and came across these. I purchased the white ones and I love them. The case is sleek, easy to use/charge and best of all, small! I keep the case in my pants pocket and it doesn't noticeably protrude. My favorite feature is the touch sensitive earbuds. I love that I can reach up and tap twice on my left ear bud and it changes the song.

The audio quality is fantastic. These babies block out EVERYTHING. Which is super awesome for me considering I'm a college student on campus and these help me cancel out noise and concentrate/zone into my own little world while studying and walking across campus. The call quality is amazing. The voices are clear and I've had no complaints from others on the quality of my calls.

The Galaxy Wearable App on my phone adds to the experience. You can customize the ambient sound so if you want to stay aware of your surroundings, you can set it to where the headphones will distinguish voices over background noise. You can also change the sound quality: bass booster, treble, etc among many other features.

Overall: Very pleased. I will HIGHLY recommend these to my other samsung user friends!

Upgrade worthy? Debatable.","March 12, 2019","I've been HYPED about these earbuds since they were announced during Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked Event, and now I have them! I also own the predecessor to these, the Gear Icon X 2018s. I also have a pair of Jabra Elite 65Ts as well, I threw in some photos of those for a size comparison. I like these earbuds. Sound is good, definitely marginally better than the previous generation. The Galaxy Buds look better, they feel better, they're smaller, and the case charges wirelessly which is actually SUPER useful.

Now, I'm a Samsung FanBoy through-and-through, that being said, I think Samsung took a couple of steps backwards on a few things comparatively. The gestures are essentially the same as the previous gen except they got rid of swiping up and down on the earbuds for volume control. It's not the biggest deal since you can still set up the earbuds to give you volume control (based on long presses of each earbud) but now you have to choose between being able to control the volume from the earbuds or triggering ambient sound or voice commands, you cannot do both (from the earbuds at least), and that's kinda lame. Additionally, it seems like they've weakened the capability of Ambient Sound? On the previous gen I REALLY felt like I could hear my surroundings, within at least a ~10-15ft radius when Ambient Sound was active. With the Galaxy Buds that listening-radius feels significantly abbreviated for some reason? Additionally, most likely in the interest of shrinking the form factor, the Galaxy Buds no longer have their own onboard storage, so you can not store music on the buds themselves. That feature was super useful when you wanted to go for a run or workout but didn't necessarily want to have to bring your phone, fortunately not having it isn't a deal-breaker by any means.

I feel like these decisions might have been driven by the desire for more people to download Samsung's Galaxy Wear app, which is fine as a companion app. I feel as though with the Gear Icon X 2018s the goal was to help you not have to rely on your phone very much, if at all, where as the Galaxy Buds definitely make your phone a bit more necessary.

In summation, they're awesome wireless earbuds! They sound great, they look great, they're compact, wirelessly chargeable, LOUD, comfortable, and not uber expensive! Personally, I love features and options. Even if I'm not particularly going to use something often, I still prefer to have the option just in case and I would say objectively speaking, compared to the Gear Icon X 2018s, your options are definitely a bit lessened with these guys.

Upgrade worthy? Ehhhh, if you're like me and prefer options and the Gear Icon X 2018s fit you comfortably then I would say you're not missing out on anything more than a slightly modified design. If that's worth an upgrade to you, go for it! If not, I think your Gear Icon X 2018s are worth hanging onto for a while longer! Lastly, if you're new to the wireless earbud game, for $130 these are definitely a solid contender, especially considering the competition. Would recommend!","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

So comfort and fit a solid 10! These fit and feel perfect! I can watch movies for hours and experience no ear fatigue. The Bose fit nice and are comfortable but unfortunately look ridiculous on your ears. I still think airpods look worse however the Bose are comfortable. Next Jabra's are nice however I did experience ear fatigue even with the smallest earpiece. Raycons looked and felt great however I could not get them to connect so they suck! Next the tranya T3 are a solid 9 on comfort and style. Now sound here the buds get a 8 from me. Bose are a 10, Jabra's get a 9 and Tranya T3 are at a 7 because the Bass is amazing! However the sound as not as clear at Samsungs buds. Battery life is also a plus. Today as I write this review I lost my left earbud for about 10 minutes! I had no idea where it was however with the find my buds app I was able to find it on the floor near my chair! I was so happy I was able to find it before leaving work. I hope this review helps.

Raven","These are fantastic!","August 22, 2019","I've been wanting wireless ear buds/headphones for years now. I just didn't trust the tech yet, or everything was way over priced. These are a decent price and are fantastic. They are not huge buds that stick out of your head making you look...special; and they are not like those small white ones that drip down and can only be held in place by ear wax. These have small rubber rims that hold them in place very well.

The sound quality is better than I was expecting. They are wireless, so you'll never get the quality of the regular overhead headphones, but they are as good as, or better than many wired earbuds I've used.

They connect to multiple devices without issue, which makes me so unbelievably happy! I can use these with my cell phone as well as my music device and it only takes seconds to switch back and forth.

I was a little put off by how easy it is to activate the touch controls - every time I stuck them in my ears or took them out, I turned on or off whatever I wanted to/had been listening to. But I have actually gotten used to this and now know how to put in and take them out without activating anything.

I've done a few calls with these as well and they are great. No issues with sound (from either end) or connection. They work better than anything else I've used in the past.

The wireless charger and charging are fantastic. I've never had them run out of battery, even though I use them most of the day at work to keep out office sounds. I don't know how many hours I use them, but maybe between 3 and 4? I've yet to run out of battery with regular daily use.

If you've been on the sidelines, unsure about buying wireless earbuds because of price or quality, these are (so far) a great product to get you started.

Two of the best features are the ability to wear either bud singularly, and be able to answer calls. (JLAB Air only allow calls from the right bud). And secondly, the fit. Between the 3 different size bud cushions, and the 2 different size fins, I was able to find a fit that was secure, and that I would have no problem wearing all day! Most other features are average, but about the same as other brand, cheaper buds (i.e. sound quality, battery life, quick pairing, charging case, etc.). The final straw for me was that the buds would lose connection when my phone was in my pocket, and I was outside walking. After researching, this is a common problem, and a complete deal breaker for me, because I use buds a lot when walking / working outdoors, and can not keep my phone in my hand! I have several different brand sub $60 ear buds, and not one of them has this problem! Because I have experienced less than stellar product support from Samsung with my Gear S3 Frontier watch battery life (a whole different problem with Samsung - Google it if interested), I didn't dare keep these beyond the return policy hoping for a fix!

When I heard about them and read the reviews, I thought they were exactly what I was looking for. Small, good battery life, and high quality sound. While it is each of those things, they unfortunately do not fit. The three sizes of ear tips that come with the buds are all around the same size, and it was actually difficult to tell the smalls from the mediums at first glance. The problem stems from the size of the speaker under the tip. It alone is about 5 mm, which when the tips are put on, results in it being a very tight fit. My ear holes are very narrow and after about 1/2 hour wearing these, they start to ache. At one point I left them in for about 2 hours and hadn't adjusted them, and when I went to take them out my ears were extremely sore and it felt like someone was pinching them with pliers. I tried comply foam tips, but the rubber ""core"" was still big enough to be putting an uncomfortable amount of pressure on my ears. This likely doesn't apply to a lot of people, but if you have small ears, you should probably look elsewhere.

The sound quality is pretty good, although the bass seems a little weak given the price. Also, I don't love that they are so dependent on the equalizer in the app to sound good. The sound without the equalizer on is honestly pitiful. I have an android, so for use with my phone it's alright, but it's just a hassle. The headphones shouldn't be so dependent on an app.

The software also has some other annoying problems, like the fact that the ambient sound mode automatically turns off upon removing 1 bud. I like to have the ambient mode on so I can hear if someone comes to talk to me at work, but I am not going to leave them while speaking to the person. If I take even one bud out, the ambient mode get turned off, and I need to go back into the app to turn it on again. That's another thing: the hold to turn on ambient mode only triggers a temporary ambient mode. I would have much rather had it be a toggle of the ambient mode, or at least have the option. Also, having ambient mode on adds a constant static sound, making me wish there was a way to set a threshold for how loud something has to be to come through. Overall the ambient mode seems very poorly integrated, almost like it was added as an after thought.

Something that I do like that you don't see that often is that there is no main bud. I can alternate between the buds at will and put one back on to charge. They are also very attractive and I like they way they look when I'm wearing them.

As a whole, I don't see these being worth the $130 as is. If you can get them for <$90, and you don't have very small ears, I'd say they are probably worth the purchase. For me though, they just don't seem worth it. One of the points in getting wireless buds is to have a seamless experience, and having to take them out every 20 minutes to let my ears rest, and then needing to turn ambient mod back on completely defeats the purpose.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Apparently it’s a known bug.
They said the solution is to reset the earphones using the app, but the app is only available on android devices and I use these on my iPhone.

Pros:
- great fit
- personally I like the way they look, very minimal and do not pop out of ear much

Cons:
- ambeient noise control not available unless u have an android device. This was very disappointing because it advertised the feature heavily. Pretty strange that you can’t activate a bunch of features that are in the hardware because u don’t have the app for it.
- broke within a month
- sound quality not really impressive.
- mic not very clear","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Noise cancellation is not all too great, but once you turn the music loud enough, noise will be blocked. When these first arrived, my right ear would feel fatigue after about 10 min. After 2 days of constant use, my ears got used to them. The only issue I am now facing is random cutoff of sound. Sound sometimes will start to mess up when phone is in pocket. Another bad thing if you take out one bud and don't put it back in the case, then the sound will cut off from the bud in your ear. Overall, these are great for the price.

UPDATE: A day after I wrote this review, they ended up in the washer. On Friday the 13th. What a coincidence. Left bud is completely toast. Case is fine, but the right bud get hot when charged and the sound is muffled. The battery is also messed up.

Also, sometimes the quality of my voice seems to make people have a hard time hearing me but this is only when I am in a noisy environment so take that as you will. Besides that, these offer an awesome sound that provide amazing noice canceling that I have not experienced before with in ear headphones. From mowing the lawn to vacuuming inside the house, I could barely hear either noise when using these. You also have the feature to allow ambient noise to hear your surroundings while enjoying these headphones which was a nice plus when you're jogging or are in an area where hearing your surroundings is important.

I gave the buds a 5 star because the are perfect small portable and last a long time between charges I'm averaging around 12-13 hours total play back and that's insane for how small these things are. The are able to be charged either with a charging cable or wirelessly and both work well.. the size and weight of the actual earbud is perfect it's super light so once it in the ear its almost unnoticeable they do cancel most noise and do offer an ambient sound setting to help keep you alert to your surroundings but I have found that feature is not as good as I was expecting. The sound from these is good for an earbud but it's just not fair to compare these to a pair of high quality/studio headphones.

I spend hours on the phone everyday day and everyone told me I sounded muffled. I have an Anker Bluetooth that I use all day long and never had this issue.

Poor bass response.","April 9, 2019","I got these Galaxy Buds to use with my iPhone, because Airpods unfortunately don't fit my ears.

I was quite impressed as I unwrapped the beautiful looking box. The design of the packaging, the charging case and the buds themselves is excellent. Pairing even with a non-Samsung phone is quick and easy, and putting the buds in is intuitive. I was pretty happy with my new purchase so far. They look and feel great.

However, once I started playing some music through them is when the disappointment hit. These buds (at least the specific ones I received) are completely unable to reproduce bass. Sounds in the highs and mids are decently represented, even higher bass notes sound pretty good, but once you get to the lowest frequencies, there's just nothing. I tried the various accessories to improve the fit but nothing improved the frequency response. Even the various cheap wired earbuds I have do way better reproducing the full spectrum of music. I don't know why some people are raving about the sound quality of these things. Did I get dud buds?

All 3 configurations 'fit' my ear; but I found that the medium inner ear and the small 'wing tip' piece fit my ears PERFECTLY. Wow I cant believe I was wearing them wrong this whole time...

The sound quality is 2nd only to Bose, for $70 less.

Looks: #1
This is obviously opinion based but because of features like the case style, actual bud looks, and they dont have the douche-vibes that you get with wearing apple airpods thus making the Galaxy Buds the best option.

Customization: #1
If you have a galaxy phone...forget it man the customization of the first gen Galaxy Buds is already light years above the competition.

Features: #1
Wireless charging, touch pad on ear buds, command customization, sound customization, EAR PIECE CUSTOMIZATION

I can wear these hours on end with no discomfort and these stay in my ears.  The Jabra's are not quite as comfy and I can't stop the right ear bud from falling out when I'm active.  The Galaxy Buds touch controls are not as slick as Jabra's though.  Jabra's work every time and their application offers a 5 band eq.  I like to set the Galaxy Buds presets to dynamic to get the best sound.  The Galaxy Buds having a case that allows wireless charging and use of the newer C type USB connector is very nice.  In spite of their weak points I'm giving these 5 stars due to sound quality, all day comfort and staying in the ear.

Having the wireless charging is a best option as now there is no need for charger for the earbuds when they can be wirelessly charged by the Samsung S10+.

The Wearable app gives much further control into seeing the sound Equalizer types and Ambient Sound options and Touchpad controls on the Buds with an option to set a custom control.

Setup of buds is quite simple and easy to setup, just opening the case near a Samsung Phone prompts user to set up the Galaxy Buds.

Good feature is that each bud can be used independent of the other which is always good when working at office where one headphone suffices.

But upon talking about what is missing, there is no option to see how much charge the case holds at a moment so it would be all guesswork as to when to charge the case.

Upon frequent use, noticed that each bud lasts for about hour and a half or so, and case charges them 2-3 times.

Size of the Galaxy Buds remains as same as the Gear Icon X, but the features have improved a lot, including the connectivity and charge time. Also the white color is really good. Earbuds are detected as put in and instantly shows the Connected message on phone and shows the previous volume level that was set.

When updating software on earbuds, it still requires both earbuds to be connected and it takes over 2 monites to update 1mb and earbuds are useless during that time so was disappointed in that.

All in all, a really good earbud with good Equalizer options and easy control trackpad

Pros:
Compact size
Individual earbud usage
Wireless Charging

Cons:
No option to check Case battery

If you read it, you may gain some insight on the Galaxy Buds :) I was compelled to do this review because of how Amazon’s customer service > Samsung’s “customer service” and for how great this product truly is. I preordered my S10+ only to be one of the many who were unlucky enough to not get it included with the phone, and would subsequently have to wait ""15 days for the promotional $130 gift card only for usage on Samsung.com” ..not sure if I will receive that or not because the promotional support is extremely subpar for such a revolutionizing smart phone like the Samsung Galaxy S10+; so, I decided to order it on Amazon and will use the $130 for a Micro SD or some other accessories, if I get it.
Amazon... you continue to amaze me :) I ordered these Galaxy Buds on Wednesday, 03/13/19 with a an originally scheduled delivery range from 04/05/19-04/29/19. THESE BUDS ARRIVED 3 DAYS LATER ON Saturday, 03/16/19. WHAAATT?? Thank you, Amazon!!! Now THAT is quality service for these quality Galaxy Buds!
The new 2019 Galaxy Buds are purely amazing.
The highs are great; I personally have the sound toggled to ""Bass Boost"" on the Galaxy Wearable app and the sound is utter bliss. I have a pair of ""noise-canceling"" Bose QuietComfort 35 II, and the sound quality on these Galaxy Buds definitely compare with “elite” brands because of its quality. I find these Buds to be on an even keel as far as sound quality with a variety of genres in the “Bass Boost” mode: rap, rock, country, reggaeton, opera, and even classical all sound great with these Buds. Trust me, I have songs in my playlist that have different ranged bass lines, I managed to fit 2 12” Rockford Fosgate subwoofers in my Subaru BRZ, and these Buds’ sound quality did not diminish and did not distort even with the heavy bass line usage. I normally use headphones to listen to classical music while I am studying, doing a project for work, or just like everyone else- shell off from the outer world. As a test, the Buds were able to ""cancel"" the screech of the BART cars when I was riding BART earlier while the volume was at 75% to full volume, something the Bose QC 35 II sadly could not do despite its ""noise-canceling” capabilities. (BART is an extremely loud, outdated train transit system in the SF Bay Area).
Not sure why the finish on the exposed part of the Buds is glossy, it would have been better off as a matte finish because it is bound to get oily fingerprints all over it. The “Touchpad” is not as responsive and comfortable as I would like. It is going to take some time to get used to because when one taps on the touchpad, to play/pause/skip it kind of drives the silicone padding into your ear drum- and is somewhat deafening with the taps. The touchpads can be customized to do voice command, quickly adjust ambient sound, or volume up/down with a touch and hold gesture. The ambient sound is an interesting feature to use, especially when someone needs to be alert with their surroundings.
In sum, the delivery was just like ordering anything with Amazon Prime, despite the projected delivery being 3-6 weeks from now. The Galaxy Buds can compare with “noise-canceling” rated headphone despite not being rated to cancel out noise. The sound quality is purely amazing with great highs and lows that do not distort no matter how heavy the bass line is. The finish is glossy, but who cares it’s going to be in your ears! The Touchpad

I have tried many bluetooth earbuds, both wired and true wireless, and these take the cake. I guess what surprised me the most is that these earbuds are unsurprising? They do everything they say they will do, and they do it fairly well.

Sound quality: Good, completely satisfactory, but not amazing. Which is fine considering their size and weight. Pretty flat frequency response, but the bass can be nice and punchy if you get it fitted right.

Battery life: Excellent, never had a problem or even come close to draining the battery. But like I said, my longest typical use is a 1 hour workout. Wireless charging is excellent, but not insanely snappy. Perfect for tossing your earbuds on your desk when you go to bed and picking them up in the morning.

Fit: Amazing. Never even comes close to coming out, better than any other headphones I've ever used, wired or not! Very comfortable and light, never caused me any problems, even during heavy running.

My personal favorite category, VIDEO PLAYBACK. I have hated every true wireless earbud I've tried because of awful latency between the video playback and the audio. These earbuds have practically no noticeable latency! It's awesome. However, I have been told that non-Samsung devices tend to have mixed results with this.

Durability: So far, so good! I have sweated thoroughly with these on, and dropped them a good couple times (the case too) and they seem to be fine. If you drop them, there is a 90% chance that the lid will open and the earbuds will fly out, but this doesn't seem to cause too much damage.

And the rub, software: Not great. Yet. It works, but I have encountered an irritating issue. Like many earbuds, these have a volume level separate from your phone's volume. This can only be easily changed if you set the touchpads on each earbud to adjust their volume. Which means you cant use the touchpads for other things like the ambient sound mode or to summon your voice assistant. Software could definitely be better.

If you have any sound quality issues, my suggestion is to play around with the phone and headset volumes. I personally crank up the earbuds all the way, then adjust listening volume with the phone.

All in all, these have satisfied a very picky person who hated all the other true wireless earbuds he tried.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I tried the B&O's and though they sounded great they were extremely uncomfortable and stuck out of my ears  way too far.

I'm happy to say that the Samsung's are very comfortable and sleek.  I can wear these for 90 minutes plus with very little discomfort.  They stay in my ears while working out too!  Once in a while I have to twist them back into place but not too often.

The sound quality is ok.  It's definitely not as good as the B&O but those are more than twice the price.  These are tuned to favor the highs for sure, and at first sounded too harsh.  But either I got used to them or they are now broken in, they don't bother my ears anymore.

As far as connectivity goes they have yet to drop out or disconnect.  They pair up quickly with my phone and laptop, and the app is easy to use.

Overall I'm happy with my purchase and if you're on the fence or thinking of getting these, I recommend that you try them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The two biggest pros of the Buds are the truly wireless nature of the Buds and the in-ear perfect fit. The idea of not having to worry about cables is an obvious feature of the Buds and boy is it great! That fact plus the comfortableness of the Buds makes this a good investment.

Pro: Feel. The fit/feel of the Buds is very comfortable and comes with adjustable parts to change the wingtip or eartip size. Upon first trying on the Buds the wingtip clips into your ear so that they do not fall out easily. The wingtip edge makes sure that it fits snug into your ear- perfect for working out or if you are nervous about the Buds falling out. If you are not comfortable with the feel of the Buds, you can simply change the sizing with the interchangeable eartips and wingtip- or if you don’t want the wingtip there are tips without the wings.

Pro: Simple Use. After pairing the Galaxy Buds and using them for a while, one of the coolest features of the Buds is the touch navigation of the Buds. Tapping once on the Buds will pause whatever you are listening to. Other navigational options are: Play, volume control, and answering calls. Also, the Buds can sense when you take them out of your ear and they automatically pause and will resume upon placing back into your ear. If you don’t like the settings for the touch menu it can be changed on the app. The other simple use is the charging. It uses the same USBC charger as the newer Samsung phones and is compatible with wireless charging pads. I haven’t had to charge them much- the battery life has lasted me pretty long stretches.

Pro: Easy Pairing. The Galaxy Buds are Bluetooth enabled and paired with my Samsung Galaxy phone easily. It is set up through the Galaxy Wearable app, (which was recently updated to include a hub area for the headphones). This is the same app that connects to the Gear watch, so if you already have it then great. If not, you can easily download it from the app store. Through the Galaxy Wearable app you can check the battery percentage of the Buds, adjust the sound through an equalizer, change what the touchpad responses are, manage notifications, a “find my earbuds option, and (my favorite) the ambient sound option. The ambient sound option allows you to hear your surrounding while you play audio through the Buds. This is perfect for situations where you want to listen to music but may need to hear your surroundings- like going on a run outside but wanting to hear your surroundings for safety reasons.

Con: Although the ambient sound option is a convenient mode to use it has its cons. The ambient sounds option makes the volume low and turning up the volume all the way does not seem to help. Also, during days when it is windy, you hear the wind more than you hear the music. The ambient sound mode is a great option to use but Samsung needs to improve the sound quality.

Pro: Good Use For library. I primarily used the Buds in the library, and they are perfect for college students looking to tune out their surroundings during studying. The ambient sound mode actually worked great here. I was able to concentrate on studying while having the volume low and still being able to hear my surroundings.

Overall, the Galaxy Buds have a great feel, are easy to use and pair, and have quite a lot of customization options. I recommend for the price!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But that was manageable - what is not is the earbuds constantly go out of sync with each other when using them on my laptop. The left earbud is about 0.5-1 second ahead of my right earbud, and happens without warning when I'm watching shows or youtube. They have no sync problems when I used them with my Galaxy s7 phone, but will go out of sync every few minutes on the laptop.

I'm using a new Dell laptop and have reinstalled drivers on my computer + tried resetting the earbuds, but the problem persists. Other truly wireless earbuds I've used had no problems (Jabra Elite 65t, Anker Soundcore, Master & Dynamic) so I know it's not my laptop. Googling the out-of-sync issue revealed that this is a pretty common problem too. So while I enjoyed these earbuds and had no problems with the not-great audio since the price was lower than most high-end earbuds, I can't recommmend these.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Horrible Customer Service Policies","August 16, 2019","Bought these and was quite happy with the easy use, pairing, and functions within. Prior to the event causing me to contact customer service, I would have rated these at 4 stars.

About a month after purchasing these, I was on a hike in some mountainous trails in Colorado. While placing the charging pill, with the earbuds inside, in my pocket, the pill slipped an hit the ground. When the pill is ever dropped, the headphones go flying 3+ ft. Well both the headphones and charging case fell into rock crevices around us. We were able to find the charging case and one headphone, but unable to find the other. What we recovered still work, pair, and charge just fine (just with one headphone). I tried to contact Samsung Support on multiple occasions to see about getting a replacement bud for the one I lost. SURPRISE: Samsung refused to work me on getting a replacement. I was told that there was no way to get (and I even asked specifically about purchasing one) a replacement. I couldn't send them what I have, then pay the difference (as I'm sure they can refurbish mine and/or provide me a refurbished bud and just pair it with mine). No options, simply told ""You have to buy another pair"". For a device that essentially explodes into its pieces when dropped from 3 feet, being unable to request or replace an individual component seems like a money-grabbing business policy instead of working with customers willing to pay for the missing piece.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

As soon as I remove them from the charging case, they seamlessly connect to my phone and all I have to do is press play. The touch controls work well.
I primarily listen to music with acoustic instruments and I am very impressed with the sound quality on that front. The bass is satisfying for me, that being said, I don’t listen to EDM.

I have used them several times over the past week. When they work they are nice, they work fine if I use them at work or around the house, but if I'm running or hiking they de-sync from each other and stutter CONSTANTLY. They are completely unusable and infuriating. They have been updated by Samsung, but still the connection problems persist. Hopefully Samsung can fix these problems in the future, but until then I'm not happy about paying top shelf prices for a beta test. I'm going back to my $20 Chinese earbuds that actually WORK.

I received my Galaxy Buds last Friday the 29th. I was excited to receive them as  I use earbuds often when working out or just walking around and the $20 set of Chinese earbuds I had been using worked reasonably well but I wanted to splurge a little on some really nice truly wireless earbuds.

Initial thoughts:

Aesthetically they are very nice, they don't hang out of your ears, really it just looks like you are wearing earplugs or something. They fit comfortably in the ears, they come with a variety of rubber parts of various sizes so you can really dial in the fit. Most importantly they sort of ""lock in"" to your ears. That is a feature that I cannot live without. There's nothing I hate more than earbuds falling out when you are just getting into a run.

I used them around the house over the weekend. Buds in, phone sitting on my desk or sometimes in my pocket and they worked fine. The sound is decent. I'm no audiophile but I've used good earbuds and bad ones and these definitely fall into the good category. The app is great, the charging case is convenient and easy to use, and the ambient sound ""enhancement"" works surprisingly well.

Now for the downside:

I took the Buds out for a little hike today, nothing serious. Phone in my pocket. At first they worked fine, but as the hike went on they started cutting out intermittently. Sometimes one, sometimes the other, sometimes they were out of sync with each other. I tried disconnecting them, turning bluetooth on and off, even messing with audio settings. I tried holding the phone, putting it in a different pocket, no matter what I tried it would only help the problem for a few seconds at most. By the time I was nearing the end of the trail the earbuds were almost unusable cutting out and stuttering constantly.

I had a similar problem with a pair of the Chinese bluetooth earbuds and I had to return them for a replacement, but now the current pair I have work flawlessly. I'll try the Galaxy Buds again and update my review, but if this continues and the connectivity is really worse than a $20 pair of earbuds I can't recommend these to anyone.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The noise cancellation is weak. I'm not a sound snob though, so I probably would have kept these buds had they been more comfortable.

I have small ears, and they were simply too big. After a while, my ears would ache from the pressure on the upper section of my ear (where the soft piece sits). I tried both the hook and non-hook style, and both hurt.

The final kicker was the first time I used these I took my dog for a walk. Mind you, it was not a run, so no real bouncing. At one point, I jogged to cross a street, and my left bud fell out. I noticed within a block, retraced my steps, and found it, but that should never happen. I can't afford to lose a $160 pair of buds. These are supposed to stay put, and they didn't in my ears.

(Pro/Cons)","May 26, 2019","I am always VERY skeptical and do lots of research before ordering a new pair of headphones. I saw a lot of great reviews and a lot of bad reviews on these.

I was looking to get a pair of Samsung headphones to connect to my TV, since  Samsung SmartTV’s only allow you to connect Samsung Bluetooth headphones, no other brands. I have an iPhone (and a lot of other Apple devices), so I didn’t want to spend this much money on something that would ONLY work with my TV, but not my phone. Luckily, they work on any device and sound great!

*These are just my personal opinions, but I’m going to break down some pros and cons:

Pros
-They sounds great
-They work with any device
-They’re extremely comfortable in my ears, which is a first for me with any earbuds (AirPods are absolutely impossible for me to wear because they hurt so badly and fall right out)
-They come with several different options for the little tips that go on them to make them more comfortable in-ear
-They’re small, but not so small that I would lose them easily
-They stay in when I’m walking, running, etc.
-They will cancel out just about ANY sound around you
-There’s Touch Pads on each bud that allow you to pause, play, play next track, play previous track, and activate Siri/Bixby
-Battery life on the buds is actually pretty great, and the charging case will charge them completely a few times before needing charged itself

Cons
-Connecting to devices that are NOT Samsung devices can be tedious at times (especially if you want to connect to a specific device but have connected them to several already, or if you’re connecting them to a new device)
-The Ambient Aware Mode, Equalizer, and Auto-sync features are AMAZING, but ONLY available on Android-based devices!
-Same with being able to change what the touchpad does on each bud. Being able to change long-press on the touchpad from Siri to Volume Up/Down is also an exclusive to Android-based devices, which really bothers me because I’d LOVE to be able to turn the volume up/down from the buds!
(I tested these Samsung-exclusive features out on my mom’s Samsung S9+ and I have to say that these features are absolutely amazing and it’s VERY disappointing that they have them locked!)

As you can see, my pros list far outnumbers my cons. Although the cons are minimal, they are pretty big cons for me. The Ambient Aware Mode and other Samsung/Android-exclusive features are incredible. Really wish they’d allow other devices to use those features, but these earbuds are 100% worth the price tag to me, even without those features.

I guess it’s just a personal preference, but I never thought I’d find a pair of headphones/earbuds I liked more than my trusty old Bose SoundSport headphones. I was wrong. I can’t even wear my Bose ones anymore because I’m so used to how comfortable these are, the sound quality, and how great the noise-cancelling is!

Hopefully this helps a little bit if you research a lot too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Ultimately, I chose the Galaxy buds because reviews said they had the best sound quality at a great price. I have not been disappointed. The sound quality is surprisingly rich, especially when you consider how small they are. The little rubber tips help to block out a lot of ambient noise. The setting that allows you to hear ambient noise works pretty well, I just don't like how it sounds. Since the last update, the touch gestures work very well. Heads up, DON'T DROP THE POD.
