Decent sound quality, pretty sound battery life, fits perfectly.
Cons:
Tedious costumer service, easily broken, cord is annoying, whistles in wind.
More details:
Sound quality, If your the sort of person who really cares about this then it’s not for you.battery life if you want something to last you all day this is not for you(1 to 2 recharges if used all day each takes an hour). Fits perfectly in the ear it has options that cover the needs of 98% of people who buy it.
Cons rant:
These headphones would usually last me just outside the warranty, so this time I got the protection plan so that if it broke I could have it replaced, so when one day I find one side is ten times quieter than the other normal side. So I look for the email I was supposed to use when they needed to be replaced, it was never sent. Mistakes happen whatever, so I go to my orders in amazon app and I get and error message when I try to contact manufacturer for the protection plan(it was just this order that wasn’t working)
Managed to get general costumer service to tell them my situation when it is obvious it needs to be replaced we switch to phone.

 I told them I wanted a replacement he said he would be happy to help and asked me to hold as he connected me to the protection plan agency, took 20 minutes... only to be put on the line with the most condescending person I have ever met, summary was they couldn’t lift a finger to keep there end of the bargain because it was still within the warranty. The person the line apologised and said he would take care of the problem, full instant refund I agreed just wanting it to be over(didn’t want to wait another 20 minutes to get connected to the headphone company). I get a full 2 dollar refund of the plan and had to go through the process of sending in the headphones to get a refund(wanted a replacement) been a week since I sent it in no response.

If you fall asleep using these they might break, if you take them outside on a cold day they will break, if you drop them too many times they might break, if you fall and they are in your pocket they will break, if you accidentally step on them because they give you the tiniest charging cord possible they will break(even in slippers). These are great for you if you are the most careful person in the world.I’ve always got these for the price I’ve had 5 by now...

If you have to cord in the front it wraps on it’s self, in a way that is uncomfortable and looks weird, if you have the cord in the back and are not equally ambidextrous in every part of your movement, then the cord condemns you to awkward one sided cord where it is so far to one side that looking towards it pulls out the headphone, and looking away feels awkward and further pushes it to that side. Unless you don’t move your head you’ll have to reset it every 15 to 20 minutes.

If you plan to go biking with these don’t, just don’t.Or if you want to use these outside and you don’t live it a city the whistling will be so loud and varying that listening to anything is near impossible unless you’re ok travelling about keeping your head permanently to the right or left to mitigate the whistling.

If there was a reason to buy these it’s probably for the price or it’s expendability. thanks for reading my rant hope it could help.
and company if you’re reading this my review can’t be bought, at best an update if you fix my problem and fix your product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound isn’t as good as the Apple AirPods but those will cost you $150. Also they won’t cancel all the noise around you but do a good job with a lot of it. They come in black case which feels like leather. I would assume it isn’t but the case is nice. They are very easy to sync up to an iPhone.  There are 3 different sizes of rubber tips for the earbuds which is nice for a custom fit in your ear canal. The earbuds are comfortable to wear for the most part. I find if I wear them for an extended period of time, they will start to bother me. I also have the comfort issue with my Apple AirPods.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After spending a little more time using them, it is my opinion that they are actually pretty good, considering the price paid. Sound is decent, battery life is really good and bluetooth calling is very good. They fit well to, even with glasses on. My only gripe is you can see a reflection of the bluetooth light blinking, when you wear your glasses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Very comfortable.","July 7, 2019","I bought these three months ago and have truly run them through their paces! I wear them at the office, at the gym, outside for runs, and at home. They do pretty well for calls, nice bass and full sound for music (I only like headphones with good bass), shows and podcasts. I appreciate their long battery life and durability. I also love how the cord doesn’t get tangled when I toss it in my purse or car console. They’re also very comfortable, they don’t hurt, and they STAY in my ear- it’s so hard to find earbuds that fit my small ears, sometimes after a while other headsets will make inside my ears ache even if they start out comfortable.

One thing that I would improve is that when the battery is low, the notification could be earlier, and less startling/intrusive (a robotic voice says the battery is low, repeatedly and incessantly, and then they die within a couple minutes.) That said, they do hold a charge for a long time and charge up quickly!
I also can’t use them to talk on the phone if there is background noise at all- my callers can’t hear me well if I’m in the car or in a crowd (i.e. at the store), but I also haven’t had any Bluetooth earbuds that are good for talking so I wasn’t upset about that especially for what I need them for at this price!
Haven’t had any issues connecting to multiple devices and I expect them to last a while.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Months later, they still hold up very well! They are great for a college student who doesn't want to walk a mile across campus without an audiobook or music playing. My previous challenge was that I like wearing dresses and gym shorts--which often do not have pockets to accommodate my phone--and I don't like having to hold my phone all the time. I was also tired of having to be careful with wires and tangles. These headphones gave me the option of setting my audio, tossing my phone in my bag, and rushing off to the next class hands free.

I also don't have to worry about them falling out as I'm walking which is nice. I have small ear canals, so I always have to go to the smallest earbud available, and even that isn't satisfactory sometimes. Not only do the smallest options with these earphones fit, but the ear hook makes the earphones falling away from my ears impossible. I wear glasses, so I was worried initially about discomfort when the glasses and the ear hook overlap, but the hook is soft and flexible enough while also maintaining its purpose that I don't feel discomfort when using them.

At first I was worried about battery power. I commute and don't want to sacrifice listening time to charge the earphones when I'm out and about. The battery power is more than enough to last me the entire day from sunrise to past sunset.

I can't speak to the audio quality in detail as a not-audiophile, but as the average modern, tech-savvy young person with reasonable standards, I find the audio quality satisfactory to my needs. As for the noise cancelling, I haven't tried to activate the full ear seal since earphones like these create a suction that hurts my ears. That is a personal thing though so I'm not sure how it affects others' comfort.

TLDR; Great earphones for a great price! Bough a second pair for my mom because of how much I enjoy these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I am very impressed with the earbuds, and for the price they have decent sound quality. They seem durable enough to last maybe 1-3 years, we shall see how the battery lasts!

I have tried probably 6 different brands on Amazon. My favorites had been the SoundPeats Q30, but they were just good enough - not great.

These Letscom came highly recommended by someone I know, so I thought I'd give them a try. I had been using my son's AirPods (because they were better than the SoundPeats and he wasn't using them) so I had something of quality to compare them to. They are definitely more noise-canceling than AirPods, and they're louder. The sound quality is only slightly less than AirPods, but not enough to complain about. I do wish they had a richer bass sound, as I like to listen to music with a lot of bass. But overall, the sound quality is very good.

At first I didn't think they were that great, but once I changed out the ear piece things, they fit just right in my ears and the sound was loud. I actually had to turn the volume down a bit because they were too loud.

My favorite feature is the side button that lets me pause the music so I can talk without removing the earbuds. I do wish I was able to change out the piece that goes over top of the ear for a smaller one. I have small ears and that piece doesn't quite fit right around the top of my ears, but it's not much of an issue as the buds stay in nicely regardless.

I liked these so much, I bought a pair for a gym buddy who lost his earbuds on the Metro. He likes them too!

Seriously, just buy a pair. You can't go wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Best quality for the $$ in my opinion!","July 2, 2019","First, I am an aerial performance artist and dancer and *rely* on my headphones to be able to train, choreograph, abd warm up before sets. Music is my life. These were on sale, so i gave them a try. i was pleasantly surprised. And these headphones stay on even while i'm spinning like a dervish upside down. rare that earbud-style headphonez do that! For the price, these headphones are amazing. they pair quickly and seamlessly; they can pair to two devices at once (i pair my phone and mp3 player) the sound quality is not quite what you can get from full headphones but for earbud-style headphones like these - the sound quality surpasses my usual go-to brand of earbuds (taotronics). The button controls are intuitive and straight forward. i like the extra buttons for spund adjustment. The noise cancelling ability is on par with othet earbud style headsets, could be better. Finally, my only beef with these is i eish the cord was firm, not loose, or a least shorter. i've managed to catch them on one of my batons and pull them off. for most uses, though, i dont think that this woukd be a problem. overall, a good brand to watch, and excellent quality for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

So I got their cheap POS heart rate monitor (DON'T BUY), then got an offer with it that they would send me a free product if i would write a positive review about both of them, or contact them before posting a negative review... fishy fishy...

So chose these bluetooth, WATERPROOF earbuds, whatever u want to call them.

I'm a bit of an audiophile and came from the Powerbeats 2, the audio quality of the letscom headphones are not as good. I also think that the Powerbeats 2 have a better fit overall. These stay in the ear well, but the over-ear part is very flexible. I use these headphones for workouts, biking, walking, work, phone calls, and airplane travel. The issues that I point out here are not bad- I am satisfied with my purchase and would buy again.

Pros:
- Price, it's amazing how much these can do for the price.
- Popularity. I work across 4 gyms and see these things everywhere. Even our staff like them. Proof that they're doing something right!
- Battery life
- Button location
- Phone call clarity

Cons:
- Audio quality (compared to Powerbeats 2 which I bought for $100 years ago). Good enough for me though!
- Shape/ear fit

Sound/Audio:
- After using it for several weeks and comparing it with some other wireless headphones, I think the audio and sound is one of the highest quality for bluetooth, wireless earbuds
- The bass is really good, and the stereo sound is amazing
- I really like the CVC noice cancelling feature, when I'm in a noisy environment such as the train, these headphones do a really good job of blocking out the outside noise and allowing you to focus on the sound from the headphones
- You can listen to these headphones from a good amount of distance from your device

Design:
- The headphones fit very well in my ear and stay on very nicely even while I do activities such as working out at the gym, running, biking, etc.
- They are very comfortable to wear
- I like how you can put them over your neck so they don't come in the way
- One feature that I would really love to see in the next version of this product are magnetic clips on the headphones so when they are over your shoulder, they can stick to each other making it easier to stay on your shoulders

Functionality
- I love how quick and seamlessly the headphones connect to your device. Since both pair of earbuds are wired to each other, there is no need for them to pair to each other; therefore, as soon as you turn them on, they pair automatically to your device very quick and easily
- I like how you can control the volume of the sound from the top of the right earbud which is very convenient
- The battery life is amazing on these headphones. I have been able to use these for the whole day without having to recharge them. Sometimes when I don't use them heavily, they last several days without charge. They battery life for these is about 8 hours as listed on the product page which met my expectations for how long they will last with a single charge. The charging time was also fairly quick for me to recharge the headphones.
- The earbuds worked really well with my iPhone XS and also worked well with my Mac and my Windows 10 laptop
- They are also waterproof which is a big plus in case they accidentally fall in water

When I decided to look for a set of bluetooth headphones, I was hoping to find something that was lightweight, that had good sound quality, and that I could use daily. These headphones well exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. I spend a lot of time on my feet moving around, whether it be working in the kitchen or around the house or exercising, and I like to listen to news and podcasts as well as music, and these headphones give me the freedom to move around without getting tangled up in a cord or having to drag my phone around with me wherever I go. They also block out surrounding noise well, so I'm able to focus on what I'm listening to without the distraction of outside noise. I'm also very happy with the battery charge, which lasts for several hours before needing to be recharged. Great purchase!

My one nitpick—when the battery hits 30%, it begins to tell you that “battery is low,” and then repeats it over and over until they finally die, meaning that your remaining listening experience is now completely ruined until you can recharge them. I don’t mind a heads up, but how about when there’s only maybe a minute or two of juice left? Why not let us actually enjoyably use more of the full capacity of the charge?","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Pairing was super easy and super fast! I run near a highway so the noise cancellation feature worked really good.  In the beginning I had some problems with fading in and out depending on where my phone was located in my pocket.  After about ten runs the fading problem seemed to go away for the most part!  After less than two months of use the volume/multifunction buttons stopped working even after resetting several times.  Finally after 70 days it shut off and when attempting to charge no red light comes on to notify me of a charging state even after days of keeping it plugged in.  I can only get enough charge out of it to work for two minutes and then shuts off again! When I do turn it on all the red and blue lights come on so am not sure if it is using the same led for charging or not but this happened the day after the support contract ran out.....My guess is moisture got to it since I do sweat a lot!

Previously, I had some JBL Yurbuds for 3 times the cost that broke in 2 weeks. These are light, the sound is loud enough to listen to audiobooks even on loud busses, and they hold a charge all day. I'm not sure how long they take to recharge because I just leave them plugged in overnight, but I've used them daily for about 4 months now with no issues at all. I have really small ear canals so almost all earplugs don't work for me since I can't get them to sit in my ear properly and they just fall out. But I put the smaller tips on these and they are perfect. I've never had any that stay in this well. I like how soft the ear loops are. They don't dig anywhere because of that.

I traded out the traditional covers for the earplug version. They are incredibly comfortable, and do a great job of blocking external noise. After wearing them for well over an hour my ears weren’t sore at all, and they stayed put thanks to the earplug covers and the adjustable ear loops. Sound quality was better than expected—I don’t expect earbuds under $30 to sound like over-$100 models—but these are quite good, with adequate bass presence.

Great little no frills BT headset","October 9, 2019","For the price, there's no comparison. Amazon Choice for a reason. Battery life is as advertised or better; about 8-12 hours of continuous use before it warns you ""battery low."" Gives about 3 warnings in a 2 minute period then dies. Don't get caught without your charger. Only 3 buttons, so ""long press"" and ""short press"" come into the equation for volume and track skipping. Only con is on occasion, the button for ""skip forward"" changes to ""skip backward,"" and vice versa. At first I thought I was crazy, but you'll be listening to a playlist, skipping tracks when suddenly, you go to skip a track and the same button you'd been using to go forward becomes back, and back becomes forward. Not enough of an issue to scrap the whole headset, but it does keep it from being 5 stars, because although these aren't going to impress an audiophile, the fact that you're considering a $20 pair of Bluetooth headphones means we prob have the same audio standards.

I wanted something with a longer battery life and this was able to last 3 work out sessions a week at around 2 1/2-3 hours each before being charged. which is inline with the usage advertised. No issues with sweat either.  I also wanted to be able to turn my headphones louder  then my old pair, so the built in volume control is very nice.

I bought these specifically because I was running a 10k race and needed something that would sound good, be comfortable, and wouldn't fall out during the race. I'm very pleased to say these not only met my expectations but surpassed them.

They arrive in a small case with extra rubber earpieces. I wasn't expecting all the extra ear pieces but I was super pleased because the pair that was on the headset were a little big. After experimenting with the different options I found the perfect size. After charging them I took them to the gym and used my Garmin music watch and paired them. It worked perfect with my watch and my Google Pixel 3 Android phone.  The workout was great and I barely even noticed that I was wearing them.

Race day went perfectly. What I also wasn't expecting is how good the noise cancelling was. During my race I was surround by a few hundred runners. With a bit of volume I didn't hear anyone around me and could concentrate on the music  and my running.

I highly recommend these for runners, anyone into working out, or anyone just looking for a good set of Bluetooth headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Paring: Pairing is as easy as you switch on the light. Once I connected to my mobile, whenever earbuds took out from power box it's automatically getting connected within no time.

Certainly, way more than we expected for the price. Hooking these up was a breeze to Bluetooth and it was immediately recognized, but what blew me away being a sound engineer and producer in a studio was the sound quality for the price and the great frequency response. It covers everything from low bass to crisp high treble which is great. What's best is mobility. The battery last and you can move with these so much that when I'm going over songs at the beginning of sessions, I find myself reaching for these to start off.

I also needed good sound quality (I'm a professional vocalist and can't stand crappy sound) but didn't want to spend a kidney on headphones. I purchased these and I love them!

Pros:
- They STAY IN PLACE WHILE WORKING OUT!!!! Soooo important. It's so annoying when you're in your stride and you have to stop to readjust your headphones. I've had these about 3 months, and have never had an issue with them slipping off mid-workout. Running, HIIT, Strength Training, Circuit Training... I have had zero issues.

- The sound is PRETTY GOOD for <$30 bluetooth headphones. Sometimes it does do this thing where the sound is more mono - kinda like a lower frequency - but that's normally right after pairing. When I first bought them I ran into this issue and was ready to return them because the sound sounded like crap. Tinny and thin. But after re-pairing them, the sound was great. So if you have this issue, make sure they're fully charged and try to re-pair them with your device. The sound should resolve itself.

- The noise cancelling properties of these bad boys is AWESOME for a <$30 pair of bluetooth headphones. I have a roommate who talks NONSTOP (she's horrible at reading social cues) and these do a great job of drowning her out - even at low volume.

- This may be weird, but I actually like that they have a connecting wire. When I'm not listening to anything, I'll typically unpair them and power them off to save battery power and just let them hang around my neck. They stay there. They did come with a really nice carrying/storage case, but I just use that as a coin purse now so hanging them around my neck is great. Lol

CONS:
- If you sweat, you'll feel it. I don't really sweat a lot, but I know a lot of ppl that do and I could imagine the backs of the ears kinda feeling gross and sweaty with these on.

- The battery life could be better. I'd say they last about 5 to 6 hours of consistent use and then they need to be charged again. For some people this may be a non-issue. For someone like me who constantly uses them to listen to music and other content, it can be annoying to have to pause listening or watching something to charge and then repair them but on the bright side, they charge pretty quickly. I'd say 30 minutes of charging time and they're good for another 5 to 6 hours.

- They don't come with a charger. Or maybe just mine didn't, but it's no big deal because it uses a micro-USB cord and I'm an Android user so I have tons of those laying around. It was a non-issue for me, but for an Apple user or a newer Android user who has a USB-C connector, it could be an annoyance. Something to consider.

All in all, these are worth the money. 4 stars out of 5 for the cons mentioned, but overall excellent headphones. If you're on the fence, I'd say get 'em! They'll probably be sufficient for your needs!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'd go to the gym and they'd fall off in the middle of my sets or while I was doing cardio. I couldn't deal with the wires anymore either. They'd always accidentally become unplugged the moment I layed down on any bench to do an exercise. Frustrating and rhythm breaking. Anyhow I searched amazon and finally found my solution. These letscomm are amazing! They  never come off, the sound is great, the battery life is incredible, when taking calls I hear people clearly and they do as well. Plus they're never in the way while exercising. The only thing I would change about them is they are a tiny bit bulky, but nothing that you notice while wearing them, only while  looking in the mirror.

- Bluetooth works well
- great battery life
- very comfortable
- sound quality is good enough (details below)

I was looking at wireless earbuds in the $100-200 range, but at $20, I thought I'd give these a shot. I love them-- the battery seems to last forever, they stay in my ears well, and they're very comfortable. The clip is nice because I don't feel like they're going to fall out even when I'm running. Additionally, I didn't have any issues with the Bluetooth, and the range is pretty good. If you're looking for inexpensive wireless earbuds, these deliver and then some.

My biggest concern when I ordered these was the sound quality. To test it, I compared them side-by-side with Sennheiser HD600 headphones (the gold standard for studio headphones) and wired Google Pixel earbuds. The studio equipment obviously blows these out of the water, but it provides a good reference point.

As with many consumer audio products, these earbuds sound terrible at high volumes. The treble becomes harsh and tinny and the bass is very thin. That said, I never use them at a high enough volume for it to matter. At lower volumes, the treble is pretty good, while the bass is still lacking in depth, which is pretty much what I expected.

At low or moderate listening levels, the LETSCOM earbuds were comparable the Pixel earbuds. The Pixel buds have too much bass, which makes the higher frequencies sound muffled. By contrast, the LETSCOM earbuds have clearer highs and mids, but thin bass. With EQ, they sound about the same. The wireless version of the Pixel buds costs $160, and assuming they sound about the same as the wired ones, I don't think it's worth the extra money.

I'll probably replace these in a few years when there are better, cheaper Hi-Fi options available. Until then, these do the job nearly as well as products that cost $100 more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However, that's only because I waited to replace them two months longer than I should have. Around Aug 2019 the left ear bud stopped working so I got about 6 months of good use from them but the durability left much to be desired. I know they are relatively cheap headphones but I've had headphones of the same price last way longer. They are definitely not noise cancelling. When I had them in I could still hear every sound in the gym unless I turned them up to full volume, which I don't recommend as that can damage hearing. That's fine though, because I didn't expect them to be good at noise cancellation. They weren't good at moisture wicking  at all. The one area they did excel was in the battery lift category. I would charge them on Monday for about an hour and wouldn't have to charge them till after my workout on Thursday. That was when I was working out all five weekdays for about 1.5 hours a day. When I switched to a three day weightlifting schedule then I could use them all three days off of one charge. Overall, they are good for a transition pair, or if you're ok replacing them often.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

OMG I don't know where to start but I will:

-> The packaging is BEAUTIFUL!  I know that seems trivial but it really it very pretty and durable box.  Everything is black and its very sheek  looking.

-> The case is ADORABLE!  perfect size not too small where you lose but not too large that it takes up any room when traveling.  It's a hard case so dropping it isn't a problem either.

-> The fit is PERFECT!  They come with 3 different ear sizes so those that need the small or larger sizes can adjust to their liking.  The fit very comfortably inside the ear and don't fall out.  I use mine at the gym and they still fit very snugly without having to constantly readjust.

->  They Charge FAST!  Charging fast is very important to me as I use these A LOT and i often times forget to charge them, so when I do remember a quick 15-20 min charge last a long time.

-> Sound quality is CLEAR!!  The sound quality is top notch.  I don't hear anything else going on around me when I have these turned up and there is no crackling or fuzzy noise sounds when I use these.

There really isn't anything that I don't like about these!  As a matter of fact I've already ordered my son and my daughter a pair, they tried mine and they're trying to steal them but for this price and the quality I can easily afford to get them their own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was replacing a pair of Jabro sportpace wireless headphones that I absolutely loved, so I had high expectations for these. The sound quality is really good, but what really blows me away is the battery life. I listen to these all day at work and the battery lasts 2 or 3 days at least, depending on how long or loud I listen to them.

The only complaint I would have is that the ear piece is a little flimsy which makes it more difficult to securely attach to the ear.

While running, they did stay on my ears, and the medium ear pieces allowed me to still hear traffic.  For $20 this maybe be enough reason to buy them.  But I dislike the rubberized cord which ends up catching on my neck and tugging at my ears.  It is a little better if you use the included  cinching insert, but still does not entirely eliminate the tug when you turn your head.  Sound is underwhelming.  Bass distorts and the midrange lacks power.  Good enough for audio books, but if I am not running I'll go grab my other earbuds because they have much better sound but no over-the-ear hook.  Ultimately I'm happy enough with these to keep using them for running, but if these are going to be your only pair, i think you get better value by spending a bit more.  One last note, the remaining battery percentage does not seem to decrease linearly, making it a little hard to predict how much longer it will last.  No a big deal if you leave it charging when not in use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have the matte black version and it's built with high-quality plastic will endure the harsh conditions of various workout regimes: weight-training, running, cross-fit, etc. The ear hooks are well made and will fit around your ears well even if your glasses (like I do).

Sound: 4.5-stars
The Letscom's have a full range sound that I like and on par with other headphones in its class Tao, Phaiser, Plantronics backbeat etc. Shortly after purchasing the Letscom's, purchased Beats Powerbeats Pro as I was planning on using the Letscom's as a backup pair of workout headphones. While the Powerbeats were beautiful, yes Apple beautiful, I couldn't quite get the fitment right due to the thickness of my glass's arms. The fitment affected the way the Powerbeats fit within the ear which affected the sound quality. I did try the Powerbeats without my glasses and it seemed the sound level and quality wasn't as dynamic as the Letscom's - strange right?

You would think a $240 headphones (Powerbeats) would surpass a $20 (Letscom) in every category and I can tell you it should but it didn't so the price isn't always a factor. Sometimes you have to get the products in your hands to do some hands-on testing. I sent the Powerbeats back.

Usability
- Pairing:  pairing the Letscom's are a breeze and what you would expect - hold a button on the headphones while opening the BT in your phone and selecting the Letscom when it appears on the BT screen.

- Fitment:  wearing the Letsom is easy, it's keeping them on that's harder. While the Letscom's are easy to wear unlike the Bose (see below) the ear hooks while pliable are too pliable, the ear hooks loosen during your activity requiring an adjustment. Whereas the Powerbeats ear hooks were rigid but too big causing a fitment issue, so there's a fine line between rigid and pliable - further testing is needed to ensure the ear hooks are rigid enough to stay in play but pliable enough to fit over glasses etc.

Overall: 4-stars
If you're looking for an excellent pair of wireless headphones (the best in their category in my opinion) for a workout, leisure listening, yard work or whatever - look no further. I don't think you'll be disappointed there a solid 4-star product. I am giving 4-stars because while the ear hooks fit with my glasses (Oakleys) there not rigid enough to keep the securely in my ears without adjustment. It's not a deal-breaker but annoying enough to demerit 1-star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However, recently, I've noticed a LOT of interruptions and disruptions in sound. I noticed it first while riding my road bike. Every time I turned my head to the left, the sound cut out. It didn't happen when I turned my head to the right, and it didn't happen every time I turned my head to the left. Then, it started doing the same thing on my walks and runs. And then, it started doing it randomly (without me even turning my head). On today's run, the sound cut off completely and I had to turn my bluetooth off then on again on my phone to get it to re-connect. This is seriously annoying.

The second thing I really dislike is that there's no indication of battery power left. Too many times, I'll have them on when I'm grocery shopping - listening to an audiobook. And then I get the dreaded ""Low battery"" notification. The headphones state that 5-6 times, in rapid succession, and then simply shut down. You get, maybe, 10-15 minutes after the first notification before they shut down.

On the positive, the sound quality is really good and they connect quickly to the phone. It's nice not to have to fiddle with a connection when I want to use them.

Overall though, I wouldn't buy these again. I am now saving my money for a pair that will fix the two issues I mentioned above.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I decided - what the heck, these are reasonably inexpensive and with good reviews, so I will give it a try.

I did the right thing. They are everything that I had hoped for. They pair quickly and easily. They fit well. And they sound good. I am totally happy with my purchase.

Note that I have had these for only a few days. I have used them a couple times. So I could run into a problem shortly that I have not yet seen. And I don't have too much to say about battery life yet. I charged them once and used then three times, for more than 3 hours.

The headphones arrived nearly completely charged right out of the box.  I was able to pair them to my Android phone and Windows PC.  Pairing was easy for both.  Initially I was disappointed with audio quality coming from the PC.  The music sounded like it was coming from a tin can at the bottom of a pool (really bad), but podcasts from the computer and conversations over the phone were fine.  After double checking I realized I was listening to music with the hands free profile but I should have been using the stereo profile.  Once I switched to stereo profile the music from the PC was great.  Battery life seems great as well.  Once I charge them (which doesn't take long) they tend to run all day even though I am using them for music as well as for phone conversations.

CONS:
Charging the headphones disconnects them from devices so reconnecting after charging is necessary (takes seconds but has to be done).
It was too easy to redial the previous call and not cancel / hang up before the other person answered.

VERDICT:
I would buy these again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

You can't beat this price. The quality of these headphones are top tier with a sleek design similar to all those other big name brands. I bought these simply for any type of fitness related activity, that being resistance training and cardio. So far, no issues or any form of discomfort with my ears during my 1-2 hour sessions. My only minor complaint is that the wire is a bit long. If they had some sort of clip to close the gap of the wire, it would be an awesome addition. The headphones come with it's own case with a short usb charger and extra ear buds to replace (major plus). The range of the bluetooth goes pretty far which I'd probably estimate anywhere between 25-35 yards maybe even 40. Enough to cover a standard turf setup at a commercial gym as I do not personally like to have my phone on me. As for sound quality, the bass is pretty deep and rich as long as my phone volume is maxed out. At times, I feel that the left side of the earphone kinda lacks with the base, but with a minor adjustment the sound quality improves. I probably started noticing this after 15+ sessions. The battery life of the earphones last a good while, I did not have to charge mine after roughly  6-8 training sessions. Overall, a great set of wireless headphones for the price.

I’ve never been too successful getting any earphones/buds to fit my ears.  No matter which size of inserts I used (I even experimented with other brands of inserts), I never felt I was getting the degree of fit I needed to receive the full impact of what noise canceling technology these have.  This is true of all the in your ear headphones I’ve tried, so I can’t  fault product.

Update: after finding and trying a smaller earplug set, I was able to get the noise cancelling effect.  I was wearing these in my office when two people behind me were carrying on a conversation that I wasn't hearing!  I only noticed because my office mate had turned and got up to speak.

Collins","Good Value Bluetooth Headphones","July 20, 2019","I ordered these headphones specifically for working out -- I was using Beats Solos, but they were far too bulky and harder to clean after getting sweaty. These headphones are lightweight and came with a convenient little case (that also stores a charging cord) so they are easy to pack up and bring to the gym. I found it very easy to connect these headphones to my phone via Bluetooth; the directions that came with the headphones are simple and clear.
These headphones have great sound quality, and even at 25-30% of full volume, I find they effectively cancel out noise from my surroundings. I prefer to use these for weight lifting or core exercises, routines that don't involve a lot of sudden, jerky movement. I notice that when I'm deep into my workout, the moisture wicking feature doesn't really hold up. I often have to take the buds out of my ears and wipe them off, and they will fall out of my ears if I don't dry them off manually. I have pretty small ears and have trouble finding earbuds that fit me properly (including Apple headphones), so I do not believe this fit issue is unique to this particular brand of headphones.
These are a great value for headphones!

Hughes","NOT WATER-PROOF, NOT EVEN SWEAT-PROOF! FALSE ADVERTISING! REMOVE THIS PRODUCT! ABSOLUTE JUNK!","October 26, 2019","I bought these headphones twice for running.

The first time I bought them, they lasted about a month. I was out on a run and I guess I didn't charge them enough so they died at around mile 2. My bad, I took the headphones off, put them in my pocket, and ran for another hour-hour and half with them in my pocket. When I got home, I put them on the charger and came back to them the next day when I was ready to run again. The headphones weren't charged at all. I tried different cables, different power supplies, different wall outlets. These headphones were dead. My bad, for 17 bucks I didn't think these headphones were waterproof, but they at least seemed appropriate for working out with.

I thought maybe it was just a fluke or a bad pair, and at $17, I wasn't going to make a stink about it cause the headphones did a fine job when they actually charged so I bought another pair. This pair lasted about two weeks. I ran a half marathon with them on last weekend and after I finished, I had to put my headphones somewhere and all I had were my pockets... Knowing that last time I put my headphones in my pocket, they never came back to life I did it again, figuring I had to do something with them for the afternoon and if they die, it's only $17. So I leave them in my pocket for about an hour and eventually put them in my running bag... Three days later I take them out for my next run. They were completely dead, figured maybe I didn't turn them off properly after my race, hoping that they didn't die permanently from being in my pocket.... I try to charge them, no juice... again... No lights, no sign of life... What a stupid product. I left them on the charger for three days,  going back to them just now as I am getting ready to go running... still they are completely dead.

So lesson learned, you get what you pay for, but I was curious so I dug into reviews of others to find that many many people were complaining about how ""waterproof"" these aren't, despite being advertised as such. My jaw dropped to the floor, LETSCOM ADVERTISES THESE AS WATERPROOF AND THEY CAN'T EVEN SURVIVE BEING IN A SWEATY POCKET FOR AN HOUR. THESE NEED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE MARKETPLACE. WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF TIME. DO NOT BUY!

I’d say for me if I’m doing something else and not focusing on my ears, it’s fine. I used on a call and the other person said sound was good.  Also I tried two different sets of the knock-off white apple-style air buds, and these are much easier to use and sound better.

The noise canceling really works well. So these would be even better for exercise in the gym.

I've never wore headphones in the shower before, these had said ""waterproof,"" I was curious. I'm one of those people who does watch stuff in the shower, so I wanted to try these out to enhance the experience. I don't know if they are truly waterproof but they still worked after I showered with them. In fact days later still working without any issues. The sound is very good, they fit into my ears quite well.

I bought these mainly because my wife is clumsy. She works in NYC, and dropped one of the earbuds onto the subway. So I got her these because they are wired, good battery life, and they clip over the ear for security. She's been using them for a few days and love them. They are solid, great sounding, and they even come with a nice case to house the headset. Earbuds are the cool thing right now, but these cost less than half than most of the earbuds and sound twice as good. The battery life is just killer. For $20 these are hard to beat. Great for the active person.

Get yourself these LETSCOM headsets. You won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They pair easily and fast with my phone. The controls are good. They are very lightweight. The fit could be better — I tried all the earpads and none really seem to fit snugly. The earhooks do a good job though sometimes they seem to float above my earlobe and not really grab on. The earhooks are not adjustable.

The sound is ok. My biggest complaint is that I actually cant turn them DOWN enough. There appears to be a low decibel setting that i cannot go under. So I dont like to blast music into my ears and when running I actually like them pretty low — just to get a beat going that I can keep pace to in the background and still be able to hear traffic, other people, etc. around me..

I tried these on the very lowest volume setting and it is too loud actually. My iPhone is set to the lowest volume setting and nothing I do seems to make them any lower.

I had a pair of Beats Powerbeats Wireless before this and I was able to dial the sound down to a whisper.

Otherwise these do the job and they werent expensive. But if i cant get the volume any lower I might have to look into another brand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I use them mostly when mowing grass on a farm. What I have found is that I need to carry my phone in my right hand pocket (I normally carry it in my left) because the Bluetooth will cut in an out with normal movements involved in driving a tractor or lawn mower. I assume its because the circuitry for coupling is in the right earbud housing. Another alternative is to wear my phone in an armband on right arm. I've seen the same problem  in other brands, so I wouldn't blame Letscom for being any better or worse in this style and price point.
The sound quality is good, but a little weak for using when working with noisy equipment; probably for the best sense I need to be able to hear if something goes wrong around me. I find that I have to adjust the snugness of the earbud often, but that is also common across the earbuds I have owned.
When I use these just for walking, I think they are quite adequate, and have a nice range of frequency and good volume level. They tuck under my collar when not in use so I don't lose them.
All in all, I recommend these , and have bought them as gifts for others.

OK Customer Service sent me a replacement pair pretty quickly.  I used them for about 5 weeks 3-4 times per week, and now the same thing happened with the first pair.  They don't take a charge (though the status light says it's charging), and I can't turn them on.  I've reset them per the user manual, but they will not power on, they will not take a charge.
So they are inexpensive, but the two sets I have tried, only last for 15-20 uses.  Therefore, cannot recommend.

So my headphones are used 5 to 6 days a week, outside in light to moderate rain, snow, and humidity. I need headphones to be secure, and have decent battery life. These headphones have been awesome! They stay securely in your ear, are light weight, and I haven't had any issues with sweat or rain compromising the sound. Also they charge surprisingly quick, and the battery life is accurate. I previously had Sony wireless headphones, which were good, but heavier and not as comfortable... also they were $99. Definitely recommend these! My only suggestion, as I hate a cord touching my neck as I run, slide the excess in the back in your headband, or through the back of your hat. The only con would be, like a lot of bluetooth devices, if you receive a call I've had people say they have trouble hearing me. You can hear everything clearly from a caller, but I've been told I sound like I have an echo... That doesn't bother me, as I bought these to run in and not for taking calls.

They stay on my ear really well during my workouts and haven't had a problem with them falling out on their own. I have accidentally pulled one out when putting my hair into a ponytail though.
The sound quality is the only reason I took off a star. It's not amazing sound quality, but it's not really bad either if that makes sense. I wouldn't expect it to be great for headphones at this cost though. The quality doesn't really matter to me, especially when working out so it's fine.

The range is good, sound quality exceeded my expectations, given the price (I am an audiophile, so hard to please). Noise canceling is not there. These are in ear phones with rubber inserts, so the better they fit into your ear, the more noise canceling you get. This set is comfortable to wear for me. I do wish there were larger inserts offered, since it would provide for a better/tighter fit that I prefer. Pairing does not always work well. I have noticed that if I pair it with different devices, these will not auto-connect when powered, with exception to the last device they were connected to. So, it requires a manual connect process to work. Then they connect fine every time. Not a big deal but is an inconvenience. Overall, very please with my purchase.

Build quality it very good, with my current pair having been caught or snagged and ripped out of my ears at least a dozen times without any damage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I really liked how they fit, sounded, and worked — and I left them in a locker room after a workout.  I was pretty sure I would somehow lose them (although I thought I would lose one of the “pods” and not the whole case with both pods in it) and I did.  Not willing to spend another $200 right away to replace my AirPods, I looked around for alternatives.  As we know, brands are different (that’s part euphemism, part too long a point to get into in a review) on Amazon so I looked for value-priced options that looked suitable and took a bit of a chance on these.

Starting from the beginning, the product was attractively-packaged and included adequate instructions in general.  One weakness in the instructions is that the explanation of the usage of all the functions of the multi-function buttons (MFB) could have been clearer.  But a few minutes of playing around with the buttons and I was up to speed.  Apple’s AirPods are more elegant in this respect but (again) they are five times more expensive.  The earbuds were easy to charge and pair and setup.

Sound quality is good but not great.  I was able to use the equalizer within Spotify to get satisfactory sound and (remember) these earbuds are dramatically less expensive than what I can’t help comparing them to.  I am really pleased with the comfort.  I was a little nervous about this — because they look huge in the pictures — but they are light and fit well and I can truly forget I’m wearing them.

I just got them and started using them today so I haven’t dropped them (yet); gotten them wet from sweat or anything else; or subjected them to much of anything — so, if they disappoint with respect to durability, I’ll update this review accordingly.  Based on the first few hours of my experience, I would recommend these to anyone seeking a value-priced AirPod alternative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Occasionally will have connection problems with the phone & music would come and go. But can be solved by disconneting & reconnecting.

The blue light that signals ""power on"" is kind of bright & noticable when you're wearing it. (Even when long hair is covering it)

The battery % display is not very accurate. It'd say ""70%"" when it's really at ""5%"". But not a problem unless I forgot to charge it.
I use it when I communicate & can go without charging every day. However, charging is pretty fast.

I had finally found some small earbuds I like and that actually have some decent bass response, but they just aren't going to stay put on the rare occasion I'm doing anything strenuous.
These will! With the comfortable soft rubber hooks that go behind your ears, these slip on very comfortable for extended wear. (Extended = about 3 straight hours, very comfortable, no strain)
All the controls are on the right side and are pretty simple and intuitive. A center main multi button, and a simple up and down button.
Now lets talk about sound and bass! These have it all! Absolutely the BEST sound quality of anything I've tried so far, INCLUDING my over the ear full type headphones!! Plenty of volume as well, like, a LOT of volume!
I absolutely love these and they are my main earbuds now. If you're in the market for some amazing bluetooth headphones, you really should try these, you won't regret it at all.
Oh yeah, the handy little carrying case is a very cool added little bonus as well. It's well made and offers really good protection for these little gems!
Oh, I got the green and black ones and love the look too! I didn't add pictures because they are the same as the many already shown.

The ear hoops keep them secure, though, even when running.  The problem is they aren't terribly sweat proof.  Within two weeks, they started randomly changing volume and skipping thru tracks, and by week four they stopped charging consistently.  I'm guessing sweat got inside and shorted something out.  Now they've stopped connecting via Bluetooth for more than about twenty seconds.

Unfortunately there are some major deal breakers and I had to return these.

Dealbreakers: once it hits 30% battery it will remind you every minute “battery low........ battery low....” functionally reducing your usage to only 70% because you can’t keep using it with those interruptions. Then related to the battery it does not hold a charge for long, if you need it for a few hours then you’re good, but I’m a student and study most days. I would rather not have to stop my study session to charge the headphones.

Not a dealbreaker but not great either is the sound. I would describe it as muffled, bass heavy. I listen to a lot of podcasts and I had to adjust to the lower audio quality, which I did, but worth nothing. Also, I have an iPhone and this might be unique to me but I forget that non-Apple headphones don’t get very quiet. The lowest volume setting is a few notches louder than I’m used to, but again I know most prefer louder.

Good things, the design works well. I took them to the gym and they didn’t fall out. The controls are helpful, although play/pause makes you push the headphones more into your ear so it’s slightly uncomfortable.

For the price I was willing to sacrifice some things, but the battery alerts and battery life are dealbreakers for me. If you’re okay with charging it on the regular then you’ll be fine and will ultimately save money with these. Save money but put more effort, in the end not worth it for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I used to be a nonbeliever in Bluetooth earphones either because of battery life, sound quality, or fit. This product eased all those concerns for me.

Pros:
-Great range: I can be over 50 feet away from my phone before they start to cut out.
-Solid battery life: I'd estimate it at about 10 hours of listening.
-Quick charge: I can connect them to my 2.1A phone charger (most high speed phone chargers operate at this amperage or higher) and I can get 5+ hours of use in about 30 minutes of charge time.
-Waterproof, corrosion-resistant design: the USB port cover has a tight seal that helps keep out moisture; I sweat a lot in the gym and I haven't noticed any damage over two months of hard, consistent use.
-Convenient compact carrying case: the earbuds zip up neatly with no hassle.
-Quick, easy pairing: never had an issue with my phone (Samsung Galaxy S7) forgetting the device or generating any error messages when connecting.
-Sound quality: For headphones this cheap (and especially over Bluetooth), they preserve the frequency range remarkably well. They seem to overcompensate on the bass just a bit, but not enough for it to be too bothersome. They're $20 or less, so don't expect audiophile quality, but they're as good or better than any other $20 set of wired headphones that I've used in the past.
-Fit: they come with three different sized ear tips, and the behind-the-ear hooks are soft enough that they can accommodate a range of ear sizes without digging in or being too loose.

Cons:
-Battery meter: depending on the device you're connecting these earphones to, they might they might surprise you with a sudden low battery signal, after which they'll only last for another 20-30 minutes. My phone will sometimes indicate the headset is at 70% battery when I first connect it, and then I'll hear the low battery indicator within a few minutes. This usually only happens if I haven't charged them after close to 10 hours of use, so that's equally on me, I guess... Just remember to charge them every 8-10 hours of use and you'll be fine.
-Volume button layout: It was a bit counterintuitive to press the button farther back to increase the volume, but I got used to it after a while.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

First, let me explain that I am a fairly active person and I am also a medical student on top of that (this will be relevant later). I am going to break this down into five sections: Connectivity, Sound, Running/Exercising, Battery life, and Controls.

Connectivity: I have an iPhone and the headphones paired instantly. At first, I thought it was strange that they pair separately, but now I like it. If I want to put the left ear piece in and listen to lecture while jamming out, I can do so or vice versa.

Sound: I have owned over the ear headphones, Beats by Dre, standard iPhone ear pods, knock offs, etc. In my honest opinion, these compete with the best of them. They send you three different size earpieces (S,M, and L), and I found the medium is the best fit for myself and gives me the best bass/sound.

Running/Exercising: I do insanity workouts (T25) and I also run. So, everything is high impact and quick paced. Saying that, this is where my excitement for these headphones come in! I purchased two different sets of headphones (These headphones) and a pair that are Bluetooth, but they sort of hook over your ears. I tried them both out, and I eventually picked these over the “hooking” headphones. If you pick the correct earpiece (S,M, or L) they never fall out.

Battery life: It does have a fairly short battery life (around three hours), but if you carry the battery pack around with you, it can quadruple your battery for the headphones. I pop these in during class lectures and listen to other material. During lunch I will charge them and it carries me throughout the rest of the day. Also, be sure to power them off when not in use.

Controls: I’m used to basic headphones that do nothing, except allow you to listen to music. So, the fact that I can skip songs, and access Siri with a touch of a button is nice.

Overall, I know this sounds like an infomercial, but I really enjoy the ease of these headphones. After seeing the wireless AirPods, I knew it was only time until I wanted a pair. So, I researched what would best fit me and these took the cake.

Died after the first month. (UPDATE SEE BELOW)","July 16, 2019","I really wanted to like these, because everyone else said they were great. But sadly the right ear stopped working three weeks in, and I only used them on my commute to work. If you have freakishly tiny ears like me, the ear hook doesn’t do much to hold them in either. They were great paired with my Apple Watch due to the close proximity. But pairing to my phone in my purse lead to some audio distortion and fade in and out. Too bad. I hope to use the warranty to replace them to at least keep using them on my watch.

Update: I didn't expect to be contacted by the seller about my product satisfaction, but I was. The person who reached out offered to give me another pair to try. I received them last week and they work much better compared to my old ones. No issues pairing at all and the sound has not faded in and out.
This update is with no strings attached. I wasn't told to change my review upon receiving another pair, but the seller has been so kind and really wanted to make things right.

I used to use wired earbuds, but they kept getting damaged where the cable was going into my pocket. After going through my 4th pair of wired earbuds, I started looking into Bluetooth earbuds. I didn't need a pair that had amazing sound quality, as I only really listen to podcasts and audio books, I just wanted them to have the ability to pause, change the volume, and to skip forward/backward. These earbuds had all of those features. The hook that goes over your ear fits very well, at least for me, and I have never worried about them falling out during use. Another use of the hook that I find very useful is the ability to hook it on a collar or around a jacket button, which allows me to have easy access to the side that has the audio controls. For the cost of the earbuds, I think that these are a very good value. I wasn't expecting much with the sound quality, but I definitely don't feel like I would have a bad time listening to music. Obviously they're not going to compare to a good pair of headphones, but they are great for their price range.

Pros:
• The hook allows for easy access to controls when only using 1 earbud, solidly hooks around a collar of button.
• Has the ability to change volume or pause, button is easy to press but I don't find myself accidentally pressing it.
• You can skip forward/backward with a long press on the volume button. This is a great feature for me, especially when listening to podcasts/audio books.
• Great price for what you're getting.
• Looks nice
• Connects very quickly to my phone. Fastest connection I've ever seen in a bluetooth device, the ""connected"" message often interrupts the ""power on"" message.
• Good battery life, lasts me for a complete work day, which is about 8 1/2 hours.

Cons:
• Good sound quality for the price, but wouldn't be up to an audiophile's standards.
• A bit on the bulky side, but not overly so. I don't have any problem with them but I don't think they can be considered sleek.

Overall, a great value. I really don't have much to complain about these earbuds. I haven't tried them in a wet environment, and I likely, never will, so I can't comment on their water resistance. I would recommend them to anyone who needs a cheap pair of Bluetooth earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After my first pair, I was not motivated to try another pair, but after using and ruining so many corded pairs, I decided to try out a wireless pair and the U81's have been great!  I used to pay $15-$20 for a wired set with a headphone, so the cordless aspect was a huge bonus for such a similar price.  The design fits my ears well and they are plenty loud enough to drown out noise. They come with other bud sizes for different ears, a charging cable, and a case. The charger is a standard Micro USB. Price, sound quality and overall reliability are my favorite parts. Some aspects I wish were better are signal strength and battery indicators. My phone's audio can start breaking up at points when my phone is in my pocket. Also, if the device is not at FULL BATTERY, it will disconnect when trying to call someone. If I accept a call, the headset will power off and transfer the call back to my phone. Its not really clear what battery level is needed to have the ability to call using the headset. The battery indicator on my phone also shows the battery life incorrectly. Full charge is 100%, however it typically dies after 6.5 hours of consistent usage, with my phone reporting 70% battery shortly before it dies. (This could be my phone incorrectly reading, or the headsets incorrectly reporting. I am unsure.

Overall, I am able to happily overlook the small quirks of these headphones for the great price. I even bought a second pair when I damaged my first (my fault).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Long battery life (last all weekend- maybe 6-8 hours of continuous use) while they watch YouTube videos and play online app games.  Extremely easy to pair and much more comfortable than their previous headphone buds.  They love how they wrap around their ears and don't fall out like other wireless earbuds. They have not tried wearing them in the rain or anywhere they may get wet, but it's nice to know that they can handle a quick run to the car if caught in the rain.

Overall my kids are really happy with these headphones.  They've gone through 4 sets of wired earbuds, but they often end up broken or not working out of one ear.

Based on the other reviews on here I thought that they might not be as cheap as the price tag might imply. In some ways they are. Out of the box they are very simple and easy to set up. The control buttons are pretty easy and intuitive as well.

The two main issues that I have with these earbuds are the sound quality and moisture issues. First if I want to listen to music at normal levels, the volume needs to be turned down to about 15%. When increasing the volume, every click up on the volume button is a dramatic increase in volume output. Essentially this means that I can only listen at one volume level (15%) before the sound is over-amplified and uncomfortable. The quality of the sound is what you would expect for $20 bluetooth earbuds. It's nothing great, but fine for gym workouts and such. The sound is best at the 15% volume level, and anything else becomes very tinny and noisy. I definitely have other corded earbuds in the same price range which sound much better.

The other big issue I've had with these earbuds is issues with sweat. They are advertised as sweat proof, but it seems that anytime I do a hard workout, the sweat in my ear causes one of the earbuds to shut off an stop functioning. Once they dry out both will function again properly, but it's a real annoyance to deal with in the middle of a workout. It seems to always be the right earbud, so perhaps I just got a defective product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

For the most part, I use them to listen to music or podcasts while I'm running or working out.
Sound Quality
In terms of sound, the quality is great. The headphones are nicely balanced to where I can hear lyrics clearly while still enjoying some thumpin' bass. I generally listen to music on the lowest setting with these and, even then, the sound is loud enough to cancel out other noise. This aspect is a double-edged sword for me; on some occasions, drowning out other noise is preferred. However, for the most part, I don't like to blast my music all the time. If LETSCOM could lower their lowest volume settings to increase the range of sound you can listen to, I'd likely wear them more than I do.
Comfort
The headphones are comfortable to wear for ~2hrs or so. After that, the back of my ears get slightly irritated from the friction of the wrap-around portion of the headphones. The headphones come with different earbud sizes--for me, the standard ones that were already on fit me just fine. I haven't had an issue yet with sweat affecting the wear or fit, but that may change as I continue to use them.
Microphone
The microphone on the headphones is great, and the bluetooth connection is solid. The connection is generally good for 20-25 ft before you start to lose some connection (this is without any physical obstructions to the connection).

Overall, these are a solid set of headphones and I would recommend them for those who want some affordable, sporty earbuds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The first pair was lost on a trip so I immediately bought another pair. These are fairly well-built, bluetooth headphones that work best either in a gym or office situation. I have had the best of luck with them when listening to audiobooks on Audible, or various podcasts. Their music performance is fine, but the drivers could be improved slightly for dubstep and metal (which I happen to listen to). They can be a little problematic if you wear glasses as the ""hoops"" tend to get pushed away from the ears (which really isn't a huge con, which is why I didn't list it). Below are my pros and cons after using these headphones for several months.

Pros:
- the price for a pair of fairly reliable bluetooth headphones
- the audio drivers work well for audiobooks, and does deliver some decent bass (although they can be tinny at times).
- They're relatively comfortable once you find the earpieces that match your ears.
- Have some noise-cancellation which makes them decent for office use or gym use.

Cons:
- the plastic/rubber on the headphones smell horrible when you open the package, leftover vapors from manufacture process. Fortunately, this goes away if you let them air out overnight.
- can be a little tinny at times when listening to music like metal, djent, and dubstep.
- the earpieces will adjust and get smaller over time, and can slip out.
- I get a ""battery low"" message over and over again after it states that the headphones have 70% charge left on them (this happened on both pairs that I bought).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Harmon","An Excellent Bargain","August 31, 2019","I was agreeably delighted with this excellent bargain. Well worth the modest price! Pros and cons:
Pros:
- very fine sound. Surprisingly fine, rich highs and lows, better than other earbud-type headsets I have experienced.
- light weight.
- the assortment of earbuds that come with the headphones allow for a custom fit.
- the ear hangers lay very lightly on the top of the ear, and support the earbuds securely, so they have no tendency to slip out of your ears. This is a terrific feature.

Cons:
- the headphones seem sort of flimsy, but time will tell.
- the volume switch is tiny, difficult to find with your finger, and difficult to manipulate. But it works ok.
- an LED is red while charging and blue when charged. That is ok, but in use, the blue LED flashes periodically, an annoyance if you wear the headphones at night.
- charging is via a USB cable. The USB cable that comes with the headphones is only about 1' or 30 cm long, but it works.
- One must open a tiny rubber hatch to expose the charging port, a standard cell phone type. Inserting the supplied cable, or any cable of the same type, into the metal port is awkward and difficult.

I recommend these headphones. If they fail in some way after a period of use, I will update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Not sure why the description lists noise cancellation, as there is no active noise cancelling within the product. The default review asks for rating on ""Moisture wicking"" as well, but as far as I can tell, there is no fabric that would do this.

I always found the cord just too short or that it would tangle up as I moved my head. There is nothing worse than having your noise canceling headphones yank out of your ear while in the middle of mowing or trimming your yard. I found with old headsets, this would happen all the time; sometimes necessitating me shutting down whatever equipment I was using, pulling off my gloves, and reseating the headphones, hoping it would not happen again.

These headphones were exactly what I was looking for. They fit well in my ear and cancel the noise pretty effectively. Effectively enough that I can hear my podcasts over the lawnmower without cranking the volume up to uncomfortable levels. The sound quality is acceptable and pretty good for headphones in this price range. They were easy to charge up and sync to my phone. I had no issues there. I have been using them for about a month mowing once a week in the Florida summer and they are showing no signs of quitting on me so far. For this price if they last me a couple mowing seasons I will be satisfied. The carrying case is not something I would use, but it holds everything well and would be easy to put the headphones and all the charging equipment in just a couple seconds. Overall I would recommend these to anyone looking for a solid set of bluetooth headphones that will cancel out the background noise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

3. Available in many different colors
4. Good bass response
5. Easy to use controls
6. Comes with a free carrying case and usb cord
7. Good price!

Cons:
1. The over the ear piece is not adjustable so it does not fit snug if you have small ears

There isnt a clip to attach to your clothes, so if you're going to crazy town during your workout, they're likely to fall off if they dont fit just right. I have VERY microscopic ears, so unfortunately they don't stay on very well. (But I haven't ever found any pair that does fit, so it shouldn't be a concern unless you have baby ears.) That said, they are comfortable. Most headphones that rest on my ears hurt, but these don't. They're kinda soft and pliable around the ear loop thing. The sound quality during workouts is fine. Its loud and kinda drowns out the din of treadmills at the gym. There is a static undertone if you're listening to music for the sake of listening to music that gets a bit annoying. I listen to relaxation tunes at night and its like a hum of static, at first I thought it was background rain sounds. Lol. Not horrible, just soft and there constant white noise.

The sound quality, material, battery life, and comfort/fit are all consistent with many of the other reviews. There are two pieces of information I would like to add that do not affect my opinion of the headphones, but might be useful to consider. I have found them to be quite loud, and having my phone set to the lowest possible volume makes the headphones just quiet enough for listening in environments without much background noise. Additionally, there is a front facing light on the right earpiece that flashes intermittently when the headphones are on, which is sometimes noticeable when watching a screen, or when in a darker room. Overall, the headphones are very satisfactory, especially considering the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

It took about 75 minutes to charge (within the case) and the lights let you know if it is charging, partially charged, or fully charged.  I like that the earbuds nestle securely into the case by strong magnets - especially good for traveling in a car or plane.  It was quite easy to pair with my Android phone and with my Kindle.  They were more comfortable that a couple of my other earbud headphones and rested well in my (small) ear.  I really like that I can use just the main left earbud because I sometimes listen to stories to help me fall asleep and can sleep on my right side without that earbud pressing into the pillow - and no cords!

I utilized the headphones for a phone call.  The caller's voice was very clear and loud, even though they told me they were speaking in a soft to normal tone.  There was full clarity with no static.  It is easy to use the single, large button on the side of the earbud to answer/end and raise volume.

I then used the headphones to listen to a speak-to-text story on my Kindle, which was a bit quieter than I would have liked at full volume, but I think that is due to the limitations of my Kindle device.  When I tried the headphones to listen to music from my Amazon playlist through my phone, the volume was much better.  The sound of my jazz guitarist was full and rich, coming through both stereophonic earbuds.  I was able to move away from the paired device (my phone) approximately 50 feet and around the doorway before the music began to break up a bit.

I'm hoping to use them for worship team practice since our music minister is going to wireless headphones for participants instead of a monitor for singer/musician aural feedback.  I think these are a good set of headphones for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

1) Size & Comfort- The size is really nice because isn't too big, lightweight, and you get different sized cushions for your comfort.
2) Sound Quality- The sound quality is so amazing, like expensive headphones quality. They're really noise cancelling and they can reach great high volume without affecting the sound quality.
3) Battery durability- They charge fast(like 25-30mins) and they last like 8 hours, I tested them.(red light=charging, blue light=fully charged)
4) Style- You've different colors to buy the one that suits your own style.
5) Price- They can be more expensive because of their quality, so you would love to get a cheap product with the same quality and features than expensive ones.

Yep, you'll thank me later. :) Honestly, I was hesitant to spend another $20 on headphones as I have gone through 4 different Amazon brands with high ratings within the last year under $30. Yah...you read that right...the LAST YEAR. They simply could not hold up to the intensity I needed them for. I use earbuds rigorously everyday with my intense workouts ranging from average 1-3 hours varying from lifting weights, hiit, trail running, plyometrics, liss, yoga and so forth. I also use them for outdoor rec activities, yard work, and downtime. As silly as this sounds... I expect my earbuds to be able to work as hard and keep up with what I do. Nothing worse than being half way through a workout and your earbuds die, keep falling out, or the notorious headache of discomfort....etc. etc. I want to focus on the task at hand not worrying about my stinking earbuds, right? SO why did I go through so many earbuds within this price point and not just pony up the money for several hundreds of dollars for a name brand version, you ask? Because I am a frugal, minimalist woman that can't stand the thought of losing a pair of earbuds for that kind of money on some trail run or watching them sink to the bottom of the lake when they get knocked off the kayak. Disclaimer delivered. :)

So here I was debating on these Letscom buds opposed to $170 brand in my cart. I sat for weeks debating on what to do. I decided to give these buds a shot....maybe, just maybe these ones may be the diamond in the rough for this price range.

Boy! Was I SHOCKED and I mean SHOCKED when I first put these in! They are by far the softest, most luxury feeling earbuds I have put in my ear within this price point. ( FYI: I literally GIGGLED with joy...my kids looked at me weird with my giddiness.) They are INSANELY comfortable. They melt to your ears like butter and are so light feeling that you hardly feel them there. The first week I kept ""checking"" to see if they were still in my ears...even though I could hear the music perfectly. Weird behavior I have never performed before. Lol.  I have found previous ear buds to be stiff and uncomfortable; no matter adjusting them a bagillion times and dealing with constant slip/falling out during workouts. These have stayed put and been so easy on the ear. I find that when I take them out my ears aren't sore, tired, or I have acquired a throbbing headache with the weight of them. Some of you, hopefully, must know what I meant about that. I have ears on the smaller side since I am a petite, fiery side.

Sound quality is EXCELLENT and surpasses any earbud I have tried in this price point! After purchasing these you definitely need to listen to music in 8k!  Sound is pure, with the right amount of treble, clarity and tones....perfect amount of bass. I am a person that good bass is important...pushes you through grueling workouts.... but not so much bass that your brain is banging and you can't even hear the singer's voice (flashback to the suitcase sized sub-woofer in the trunk-of- your-car-days of high school. Not good my friends. lol. :) )

Other quality points that must be noted is they are modern and sleek looking. I thoroughly enjoy the controls being in your ear piece opposed to having a separate ""box"" further down the line that bangs into your head or neck. That is flat out obnoxious...I made that mistake only once.  Easily pairs with any blue tooth device and I like having a hard shell case to throw in my gym bag or hiking backpack.

I have been using these everyday for the past month and so far I will DEFINITELY purchase these again....sheerly based on the unmatched comfort and sound quality...they by far surpass everything I have paid for so far. Even proving to be better quality than my $80 earbuds. I admittedly am quite upset I didn't purchase these sooner.

Another proof in the pudding is when when your two teenagers steal your earbuds....yep, I hide these bad boys....over their $200 headphones that SAYS A LOT. I am excited to see how far these take me. :) Best $20 I have spent in A LONG TIME!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

They are really comfortable; the design is so that sometimes you forget you are even wearing them.
It comes with 3 earbud sizes and finding the right fit is perhaps the most important task you need to accomplish if you wish to get your headphones full potential.  An inappropriate fit will lessen the sound and noise cancelling features but of course this in only logical.

I’ve used them running, riding a bike and also while at office work.  Another great thing I didn’t except at all was the microphone quality, I don't like speaking loud when on a call, so far everyone listens to me just fine.
Voice activating commands availability is great and also the possibility to pair a second device is nice.

So overall I’m pretty happy with this product, I’m even giving them as presents to close friends this Christmas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

There are a ton of great reviews of these headphones and maybe I just got a defective pair but am returning them after 3 uses.  I run a lot and sweat even more and after 3 uses the left ear bud kept cutting out.  I also could NOT keep them in my ears Even with the over ear portion of the ear bud. Most runners will agree that on any run especially a long run, you don’t want anything annoying you.  These headphones drove me crazy.  On my 3rd and final attempt at using them, the left ear bud stopped working and I was constantly readjusting them so they would not fall out.  After 2 miles I couldn’t take it anymore and decided to take them out and hold them for the rest of my run.  Maybe my pair was defective and the fit was poor for my ears, but I would not recommend them for serious runners that sweat a lot.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Pinney","Lasts 3 months and died","October 30, 2019","I really dug these headphones. So much so that when the first pair died I bought another pair...when those died I did it again. But when the last pair died it was the last straw. Every single pair was great for a few months, then they would not charge or reset. The last pair literally turned off while I was wearing them. No battery low warning. I had not left them on. They simply were working, then crackled out, unable to be recharged or reset just like the previous pairs. It really seems like there is a flaw in the production.

I used them in the gym a lot so perhaps liquid messed them ALL up on almost the exact same timeline, but either way they claim to be sweat proof.

Again, I really dug the product, enough to buy multiple pairs, but when every single pair dies and cannot be recharged or reset in almost the exact same way, you are better off just spending the extra cash for a product that lasts.

I wanted a pair of Bluetooth earbuds that allowed me to pair 2 devices at the same time and switch between them as seamlessly as possibly with little to no lag. I bought a pair of sound peets and they were really really bad. Then I tried a pair of to zo for $50 thinking that they'd be better since they cost more. They were wireless earbuds and were really bad as well.
I felt like what I was looking for was only found in earbuds that were $100+ and I decided that I'd just get a cheap pair of earbuds to handle working out. I bought these thinking that they would do fine but amazingly they do everything I wanted them to do and more. They are awesome for pairing with 2 devices and switching between the two is much more seamless than the previous two. I've experienced a small amount of lag but tolerable compared to the last 2 pairs of earbuds.
The only thing that I'd change about these is that I'd ask the manufacturer to include an actual clip that can be attached to the wire and clipped to a shirt. I often only have one earpiece in my ear at work and would love to clip the wire to my shirt so that the hanging earpiece doesn't pull on the earpiece I have in my ear. Honestly, it doesn't pull that much unless it slides and I turn my head a lot. Also, it would be amazing if I could turn the left earpiece off and in so doing that turns the sound into mono coming out of the right earbud only.
Definitely worth the price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I only use them for about 45-60 minutes a day, 5 days a week. They seemed to hold a charge pretty well this first week. About week two, they died after a couple days which wasn't a big deal. By about month in, they wouldn't even make it through one 5 minute phone call without an alert that the battery was low. It was too late to exchange them and I'm not willing to take a gamble on purchasing a pair that might be as good as the first ones or as bad as the second. Also, the case I got with the second pair smelled awful. The chemical smell was so pervasive I threw it away and used the case that came with the pink ones. Somehow, the quality either drastically fell off between purchases or the blue was made by another manufacturer.

Just a gentle brush or tap of the master control button right on the side of the right earpiece sends it into pause mode.  Given how easy it is to tap that button just re-seating the headset in your ear makes this inconvenient.  I wish it was a full second, or that the headset came back from pause a little more quickly.

I dont talk on the phone a whole lot but they are about a high 3 star. I gave a 3 star for noise cancellation because they dont totally cancel out noise( when operating lawn equipment). They do cancel out the noise of the music playing in the gym if I got my volume close to max volume. I probably could give a 4 for noise cancellation.

The sound quality isn't the best, but for me, I am more focused on the workout so that doesn't matter to me as much, but to others, it might be the breaking point. If you are looking for an inexpensive headphone that will keep you going this is it. I typically don't have to charge them every day since the battery lasts through several workouts no problem.

I posted this review and the company reached out to me shortly after to apologize for the experience that we had with this item.  They were quick to want to make it right by sending out another pair at no cost to us.  I wanted to wait a while before revising this review as it hasn't been that long since my husband started using them again.  So far it has been about 3 weeks and he has not had any issues thus far with the headphones. I am changing my review from 2 stars to 5 stars.  It really says a lot when a company will go out of their way to make good on a situation when it comes to the quality of their products. the fact they responded to my review at all surprised me as most companies don't in my experience.  My daughter and I both need new Bluetooth headphones and I will definitely buy the same pair again!

They fit reasonably well, though none of the provided earbuds really fit my ears like I wanted. This causes a slight bounce in the headphones which makes the sound go in and out when I run. The sound quality is ok - podcasts are fine to listen to. With music they are not very detailed, and the bass is muddy. You can hear the song but can't really appreciate each of the instruments.

In the end, these are <$20 headphones and I can't ask too much of them.

So after posting the review below, I was contacted by their customer support. They suggested that the pair I received may have had a manufacturing flaw and sent me a new pair free of charge after I had returned the original pair. I really didn't think it would change anything, but to my great surprise, they actually did fit into my ears and make a seal. I did have to tilt them way up and work them in before moving the straps over my ears so it takes a bit of maneuvering for me.

Giving them another test run, I found with the proper fit, the sound quality greatly improved. For my ears though, they still slip partially out when moving around and have to be adjusted frequently during workouts. The back of my ears get a bit sore after about 90 mins of use, due to the tension of the ear strap. I still found the cord to look much more flimsy than in the picture.

However, for the price, these things work pretty well. Casually sitting at my desk, I don't have to adjust them quite as frequently, and the battery life is decent. In addition, I greatly appreciate the customer support.  For all those reasons I did increase my rating.  I'd say the new pair is about 3 stars, but the customer support raises it another 1 star for me.

Original review:
I purchased several similar wireless headphones (details below) trying to find a pair that would stay in my ear, especially while running.  These have a weird design that doesn't allow the earbud to fit inside the ear to make a good seal.  I tried all three sizes but the flat rounded part right before the tip prevents the earbud from getting into the ear and making a good seal.  The sound quality is pretty poor without a good seal.  Also, it's pretty infuriating that the cord does not look like the picture.  Instead of it being a nice looking straight band like shown, its all crumpled and wavy and looks terrible and cheap.

Out of the all the ones I tried (4 from Amazon and the 2 from Walmart): TREBLAB J1 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZXR7646/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

FYI, other ones I tried on Amazon:
> Villain Wireless Headphones - Exact same issue.  Bad design, the flat round part that keeps the buds out of your ear canal.
> Phaiser BHS-530 - These are a little better.  The make it part of the way in but still can't make a good seal because of the design causes them to pivot and pop out of your ear as soon as you move.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Instead, I decided to try these out first before spending 10x the money on an expensive pair. These headphones work great. I have been impressed with the sound quality and the fit. The only trouble I have experienced is with the band connecting the two headphones. I found that while running, the back of my neck was tugging on the band and pulling the ear pieces out of my ears slowly. I solved this by taking a rubber band to tighten up the fit and letting it dangle in front instead and have had no problems since.

Fit is very Comfortable, i watched a 2.5 hour movie with this set and it didnt give any ear pain.

Cons:
this uses a bluetooth 4.1 which is little older now, it does not make many noticeable difference though

The sound quality is great, especially for in-ear bluetooth headphones, and they cancel noise better than any other in-ear headphones I've had. The wrap-around earpiece keeps them firmly in my ears, even in hot, sweaty weather and through walking, running, and other workouts. They're also super comfortable; I wear them almost all day with no ear pain!

What I love most about these headphones is that you can connect them to two devices at once. I can listen to music on my phone, then play a video on my computer seamlessly through these headphones. For the price, you really can't beat them!

The only thing I wish was that the battery lasted a little bit longer. I've had over-the-ear bluetooth headphones with a battery life of 40 hours. These only last about 8 hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was looking for something that was affordable but also good quality. These gave me everything I wanted! You can't beat the price, and they work really well. The connection is great, and they connect to my phone almost immediately when I turn them on. They have great volume and good sound quality. I like that the ear pieces are connected by a slim cord so that I can wear them around my neck when not using them. I love the black/grey color because they look sleek and simple. They also fit pretty snugly in my ears and have an over-the-ear piece, so I don't have to worry about them falling out while running. There are also different size ear pieces if you need to change them. When connected to your phone, there is a battery display icon to show you how much battery is left, which is very nice.

I was skeptical of the sound quality and fit when I first purchased them, but was delightfully surprised.  As far as sound quality goes, for the price you are paying you are getting a quality sound.  The speaker do great with midrange sounds, but they do some richness in the lower frequencies.  Same goes for anything in the higher range.  Most people will not even notice any sound quality degradation, unless they are use to using higher end headphones/earbuds.  They fit of the earbuds is extremely comfortable; the set come with three different sized buds.  I have used them for several high intensity workouts, and have not have any issues with them slipping out of my ears.  As these are my first Bluetooth headphones, I was very impressed with the range of the signal.  Controls on the  right ear bus are also easy to use.

Everyone in my family had tried it and want a pair of their own. With that said there was a lot of pros and minor cons to the product.

Let's start with the price and the shipping:
The price was more than decent compared to other bluetooth product! I am in college so this was an affordable option compared to air pods. The shipping was 1 day (there was a free 1 day shipping deal), and it came on time with no problems.

The package and design:
The package was pretty simple and organized, nothing was damaged. The only thing they didn't have is a plug to put the charging wire in, also the length of the wire is small but a samsung charger works on it just fine!

The actual design of the product is pretty useful! My mom tried the ear buds on, she said these are the first ear buds that don't fall out of her ear. I go the gym often and I also noticed they stick in place like they should.

Connection with phone:
It connected to my phone with no problem! I also set the ear buds up, so whenever I have them on, I can unlock my phone automatically. The ear buds answer phone calls like it should but the only problem I have is changing music, skipping a song, I use spotify so that feature did not work for me. I also like the fact that I can use one ear bud for one device and connect the other one to another device, it helps when listening to video lecture and music at the same time.

Productivity:
The earbuds helps when trying to do multiple things at once, cleaning the dishes and vacuuming without having my phone on me the whole time with wired earphones. I can walk around a good distance without having my phone on me, especially when taking a call without having to walk over to my phone.

Sound quality:
The music is very clear and blocks surrounding noises completely, even when working out.

Note: The battery life of the case lasted 4 days for me personally, but I think that depends on usage and how much you initially charge it.

I am planning to get a couple for my siblings and parents in near future, it makes a perfect present.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They stay on, no problem with sweat.  Sound is good for the price, very happy.
The one thing that I don't like is that the battery charge does not display on the phone, unlike what it shows in the pictures.  There is no information about this in the manual or website.  It just doesn't show and there's no information to troubleshoot or how to enable the feature.
I recently switched to bluetooth headphones with ear clips because each of my previous wireless headphones would eventually work their way out of my ear when exercising.  Ear clips fixed that and they're not uncomfortable.
My previous ones were Mpow and I like these better.  Very similar design.  Both the ear clips (around your ear) and the ear tips (in your ear) for these Letscom headphones are more comfortable than the Mpow.  In addition, when they connect to your phone, there is a popup that comes on for about 3 seconds which tells you what percentage of charge is left.  It was always a guess with the Mpows as there was no indicator and you got a warning about 5 minutes before they died.  Not very helpful when you wear them for an hour.
Unfortunately for these,  the 3 second popup when it connects is the only indicator of the charge state.  There is no battery capacity display like it shows in the description.  Maybe that's only iPhones.  I am running Android 8.0 on a Samsung S8.  The popup is better than nothing.
I wear them 5-6 hours a week and have had them about 2 weeks on one charge.  I haven't discharged them all the way yet.  Pretty happy with that.
Pairing was super simple.
Notice that the noise cancelling is only for phone calls, not music.  I haven't used them for phone calls, so I can't verify that it works.
I'm not any great judge of sound quality, but they're not bad as far as I can tell.  When I'm not exercising I use over the ear headphones and these Letscoms can't compete with that, but the sound works for me when I'm in the gym or on my bike.
Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase.  We'll see how long they last!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I used the powerbeats3 for years and I always had to replace them after 6 months. The one thing I hated about the powerbeats is that the grip around my ears would always break off eventually. Just recently I had a pair for 5 months and they started disconnecting/turning off every 20 minutes. It was so frustrating considering how expensive they were! These LETSCOM earbuds not only sound awesome, but have a softer grip around my ears which makes it harder to bend & break! They look awesome (I got the black/gray) and they came 100% charged! I have an android so I now get to see the battery percentage unlike the beats. I HIGHLY recommend them!! (I haven't tested the moisture yet but I will!

It is very easy to setup first time and after that they will go into pairing mode when we take them off the case. These earbuds can pair with two different devices. We can use one while the other one charges in the case. Or use the together or connect them individually to its own device. This is the great advantage compare to others.

No slippage while workout. They are a pleasure to listen to and very comfortable. The music is very clear and blocks surrounding noises completely and No pain points even after 3+ hours of listening. They also provide above average sound isolation and block out most of the background noise. I love not having any wires and the convenience of quickly charging them in the case. So far the battery and charge times have been right in line with specifications.

These ear buds have great sound stage are really excellent for this price range. They have a better than expected sound quality, especially considering the price, great volume and strong bass .

I was quite pleasantly surprised when I purchased these. I have some weird shaped ears, and although the headphones did have some extra silicon pieces to help get a good fit, none really fit my ears. Again, not the fault of the manufacturer. The bass driver is quite good, and you get some good thumping going depending on what you are listening to.

I use these headphones to work out, and they are most definitely sweatproof. I have been using them 3-5 days a week easily during workouts and not a problem whatsoever. Speaking of those 3-5 days a week, I use the headphones for an hour and a half to two hours a day, and only have had to charge them maybe once a week, so the battery life is actually quite excellent.

If you are looking for a good pair of headphones that won't break the bank, look no further.

I mainly bought them so I can listen to music when I run and here was my experience: the right earbud kept falling out of my ear causing to constantly readjust, so it made wonder, ""what's the point of the ear hooks when this keeps sliding out of my ear anyway? Just like normal buds, the sweat did not wick away well with me causing my left earbud to eventually slide out as well. So if you're a heavy sweater like I am, maybe this isn't the best product for exercising. However, using these headphones for basic wear and bluetooth compatibility is great.  Sound quality is great and no one has an issue hearing me when I talk. I just use these now for phone calls, music, and listening  to Spanish when I'm studying .","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Therefore, I sweat like a beast, and I went through three iPod Shuffles due to sweat running down the headphone cord and into the jack, shorting out the unit. For the longest time after, I just didn't bother.

I looked at these kinds of headphones over the years, but none of them seemed to be intended for the type of enviroment I was going to use them in. Decided to give these a chance, glad I did. Believe I paid $20 for them at purchase. They've been great; I use them nearly every night at work. They're quite comfortable although after about 4 hours they tend to make my ear canals a teensy bit sore, but it's nothing deal-breaking.

Sound is quite good, and loudness is limited only by your phone, really, as the volume ties directly into your phone's volume output through Bluetooth (they don't have an independent setting). You can take and make calls while on them, and the mic and speaker are better than the ones on my phone (I have a Motorola E5 Plus, great phone unless you wanna make a phone call and talk to someone).

Sweat is not an issue at all. These are coated with a resistant plastic that also doesn't slip around in your fingers when wet. Everything is either sealed and enclosed, or covered with said plastic. Even the charging port has a stopper made out of rubber attached to the headphones.

Overall, they are fantastic and I'll probably be getting a 2nd pair while they are still available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Not best choice for running.","February 24, 2019","I have been using my over the ear Kinivo BTH240 for 6 years (purchased few of them for my own fault).  When the on/off button finally failed, I decided to give a try to newer headphones. I tested side by side LETSCOM, MPow Flame, Phaise BHS-530, and Edelin. To jump to the end - I didn't like either one of them. First, let me start to say that LETSCOM and Mpow Flame are exactly the same headphones branded differently. Common practice today to buy the same no-name hardware from China, put you brand over, and then try to have better marketing then others. Nothing wrong with that. So basically, both are identical, offer the same fit, function. Comfortable to wear (not for long for me), you can run with them, quality of sound is OK. Very basic sound, although not distorted, which is a plus, unlike the Edelin. The main reason I returned LETSCOM is because they are not good for long or short running because they seal you ear quite a bit and you don't hear much sound around you, which I found to be not good when you run and share trail with other people/bikes. You want to hear them approaching from the back. Also, I found in general, to have your ears plugged for over an hour (my typical run) is much more tiresome on ears when compared to over the ear headphones.  In the end, I tried Levin over the ear headphones, and they were exactly what I was looking for my runs. Other than comfort, another key difference between over the ear and in-ear is that all in-ear headphones have only 2 control buttons for sound. Same button to increase the volume and skip the song, and another to decrease the volume, and go back another song. It all depends how you press them. When you run, especially wearing gloves, it is not comfortable to play with these two small buttons simply to change the song. Over the ear headphones, offer 4 buttons (volume up, down, next song, previous song). Much easier to press with gloves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

This is awesome because I can ask Google questions without having to find my phone.  😂

I tend to favor wireless earbuds over earbuds that go over your ear, but these have been a godsend lately.  My 2 year old always thinks he needs to take out my earbuds.  These are much harder for him to remove.  If he manages to remove it (kids are fast!), the other side is still connected to my ear and he can't immediately lose it.  The part that goes over your ear is less rigid than others like it.  It's flexibly makes it more comfortable.  I still find wireless earbuds to be more comfortable, but if you have little hands who think they need to take your earbuds, these are definitely for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wore them for a complete 40 minute  elliptical workout while listening to some hypno sounds.  The sound was fantastic.  The fit was almost perfect.  I find that when you wear earbuds with over the ear clips that sometimes they will irritate your ears after a while.  I did feel a little of this discomfort but this is also the first time I've worn a pair with over ear clips in years. They provided true stereo with good base and background noise was not noticable.  When I finished my workout, during my cool down, I put on The Doors; Riders on the Storm and I actually looked outside when the background thunder started.  Connecting them was easy and with a little getting used to, managing the the small volume control is easy.  I have not used them for answering the phone but like most earbuds, I sure that would be easy too. On these you short press the MFB to answer and hang up.  I am impressed.  I have now worn these ear buds for at least 4 hrs a day since getting them.

It's hard to buy another $100+ item knowing that I'll be lucky to have it until next month.  Sadly, last week I found myself needing another set of headphones that:

1.  Sounded good
2.  Stayed in place comfortably when I worked out
3.  Had a microphone that works
4.  Wouldn't cause me to go nuts when I inevitably lose 'em

These checked off all the boxes.  Are they Bose Noise Canceling quality?  Nope.  But so far I've listed to hours of music ranging from Jóhann Jóhannsson to Tool and all of it sounded really good.

These come with choices of several sizes of earbuds.  I used the ones installed and they are comfortable, even on this morning's pre-dawn run.

I haven't talked on the phone using these outdoors yet, but usually in those cases I don't mind holding the phone to head like it's 1982 all over again.  However in my office I've answered (and made) several calls.  Everyone I've asked said the sound quality is perfect on the other side.

They're only $20.  Huge bargain!

Furthermore, they are easy to pair and come with a nice storage / carrying case.  I'll be buying another pair.

The sound in comparison to those headphones is just ok, you can tell it is a cheaper quality. The bass is not as deep and the highs are not as crisp, but it sounds good enough for me to get in a solid workout or run.

The fitment is just OK. They do not fall off my head but they do not stay super tight to my ear either, I think that is part of the reason the sound is not as good.

I haven't had them long enough to judge the battery life but it seems to be fine.

Pairing and the headphones are easy to operate.

I do really like how the ear pieces come off so it is easier to clean after use.

They are good for the money and if you don't need superior sound or fitment I would recommend them.

As it turns out, they're really good (at least, based on a couple days' use): the sound quality is great, charging time is quick, microphone quality is fantastic (much to my surprise!), and they're so lightweight, I barely know they're in my ears.

Make no mistake, these are no-frills headphones. They come with a case, instructions, and a very short micro-USB cable for charging. There's no app, no integration with fitness trackers, etc., but I didn't need those things because it turns out I already own a smartphone that has the, you know, smarts. Caveat: I have not yet tried them while exercising or in the rain. Otherwise, this was the best $20 I've spent in a while!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Not looking for anything fancy, just something to get the job done. These went above and beyond. Came with a nice carrying case (I can throw them in my backpack now with no worries!), and several earpiece sizes to swap out. Once I got the right size, they sit pretty nicely in my ear. Cancel out any extra noise too, added bonus. Sound quality is great to my amateur ear :)

Easy to set, took mere seconds to pair with both my phone and to my PC.
Really impressed with the sound quality, nice bass, good volume and speach is clear. Microphone picks up well, possibly a bit too well as when I use it on discord, typing on my keyboard is picked up.
I wasn't sure on how comfortable they would be wearing them for a long time as my main set fit around the ears and you don't feel them even after hours of use.
This set sit on your ears and I did find after 2 hours of gameplay, my ears were starting feeling the effect, but it's not often I use vr for more than 2 hours at a go so I don't see this as a major issue.
Music from my phone is great, no cable dangling around, nice clear sounds and you can make and recieved calls with it. I'm not a fan of ear buds so this set is ideal.
They seem pretty solidly made and look to be much better quality plastics than I've seen on other Chinese products. My only gripe is the material the ear pads are made of, I prefer the velour type ear cups over the plastic ones, bit having said that, these are really soft. They also fold up to about half the size of when open to wear, so storing them in a drawer is not such a hassle.
Over all, they have good sound quality, look and feel well built, are pretty comfortable to wear and have good value for money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

With other headphones, that I have, there have been 3 major issues. Poor bass quality, constant cutting out and having to rely on my phone for all the volume (and keeping it all the way up to 11). This is not the case with the IPX7's. Now I have to keep the volume on my phone at around 1/2.

As an added bonus the call quality has been top notch. People can here me as clearly as when I am wired. With all of my previous headsets, I didn't even bother trying to talk. I also take a lot of voice dictations when I am outside walking.

You can register for a free one year warranty, so I know I won't have to buy another pair this year which is fantastic.

Great sound quality, and very loud. My old earbuds were twice the price and didn't sound nearly as good. I'm no expert here but I went from listening at around 80% of full volume to around 10%. If you like loud, you'll get it here.

Super easy for a non techie like me to pair. Seriously, took less than a minute from opening the instruction book to playing my music.

Comes with a great little carrying case. I probably won't use it much because I don't go anywhere, but if I was taking them to work or on trips I'd definitely use it.

Overall, can't think of anything I'd change! Very pleased with quality for the price. My husband's $200 Beats stopped Bluetoothing after about 3 months, right outside the return window. I can't believe these have a better warranty for such a low price.

The sound quality and volume are great. The bluetooth range is pretty impressive, I can go about 15-20 ft away from my phone before it begins to cut out.
I have been using them for about 2 months now. I use them mostly when working out, and sometimes at work or working on my car. I haven't had any issues with them falling out of my ears, sometimes I'll have to reposition them, but that's when I'm working out and am all over the place, jumpin around.
The only minor problem I have with them is sometimes the wire will be kind of annoying, it'll get twisted and create a loop and is shorter, but can be easily fixed. That's more of a problem on my end then the headphones.

Update:
They are also now constantly dead. I charge them up, and if I don't use then the next day, they're dead.
Update 2: this is a great company.. even though I must have received a faulty pair, the company refunded my money and sent me new version to try. I'm going to give the new ones a try and will post another update.

After receiving it, charging it, and testing it out on a wide array of modern and classical music, as well as audio content on videos and DVR content, I came to the following consclusion

Pluses

* General sound quality (but read on!)
* Apparent construction, lots of rubber and attempts to seal and protect the innards from water intrusion
* Comfort of the over-ear/in-ear arrangement
* A set of replacement silicone in-ear contact points

Minuses

*  Initial battery life after getting a 'fully charged' solid blue LED indicator - approximately 6-7 hours, not impressive at all
* A horribly annoying warning message that as the song 'I've Got You Under My Skin' notes, 'repeats and repeats in my ear, EVERY effing MINUTE, effectively preventing you from using the device after the battery life hits the warning level.  Another reviewer has noted that this point is the 30%  remaining battery capacity.  So whatever the battery capacity actually is, you can only use 70% of it before the annoying robotic female warning notice kills whatever mood you've created through watching your content or listening to your music.  Thanks, designer.  Thanks, programmer.
*  An amplification setting that results in VERY LOUD, although mostly clear, volume level for the device.  I adjusted the device's volume all the way down, intending to control the volume level at the ear with the volume controls on my iPad Air 2.  I had to drive that volume level down to a 2-bar (i..e., almost OFF) to be able to listen comfortably to content at a normal level.  Very unusual default amplification setting.  Silly, actually.

The Deal Killer

* As I said, one of my musical tests is classical music programming, contained in my widely-varied iTunes music library.  Listening to J.S. Bach organ music is good test for any music reproduction devices - from amplification electronics through speakers, turntables/cartridges (remember those?  I still do) and headphones.

Deep, sustained bass tones, some of them below the level of human hearing, come out of organ pipes, so organ music is, in my opinion, an acid test for most speakers and headphones.  Most of these devices, particularly headphones and earbuds, cannot be expected to reproduce these low tones, so most manufacturers filter (i.e., ""roll off"") signals below a certain level, usually between 20hz and 50hz, so as to not burden reproduction  components such as speakers and headphones,

This device, whether it attempts to filter out these low tones or not, simply cannot handle low bass.  I can only describe the sound of low bass as unlistenable.  It sounds like someone successfully and continuously ripping a sheet of aluminum foil.  So ended my organ concert.  I'm sure it would fail on any other musical types as well.  Anything that would provide sustained (for any length of time) would cause the device to perform in the same unacceptable way.  Be forewarned.  Of course, it could only be this specific device that's bad.  No matter, it's going back.

I understand and acknowledge that I am writing a review of $20 earphones, and admittedly, my standards are high.  But, hey, this is what I listen to, and with a short and simple test, I revealed enough flaws in this device to decide to send it back.

It simply didn't make the grade.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound quality is also poor (fuzzy) and the microphone doesn’t work. I wish I could turn the volume just one notch lower than the lowest in quiet places, but it just mutes it. I feel like I’m getting hearing damage with these loud, not canceling headphones. They are bulky to carry in a pocket or purse and I wish they had a magnet to hang together around my neck.

I use these daily for everything from working out at the gym to taking conference calls and listening to music at work, and so far they have worked out well. Sound quality is good and no one is complaining about my audio cutting out during a call.

That said, I have only had these a week and time will tell how they stand up in the long run. Based on my experience a headset like this will generally last me anywhere between 6 months and a year based on my somewhat heavy usage.

In the end, my only real complaint(s) are they are not magnetic so the actual earbuds will not stick together when wrapped around your neck (which isn't necessarily a bad thing just a nice feature) and that the design of the ""over ear"" mechanism meant to hold the earbuds is an acquired taste as all my other headsets have had the ""in ear"" design (i.e. the little curled pieces that hold the earbuds in your ear). However, these are more just extra features that I have become accustomed to rather than a knock against the product. Although the controls on the earbuds are simple to use and understand and the battery life seems really good so far...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I use them 3-4 times a week to workout and I do not have to recharge until the end of the week. I find that they charge relatively fast as well.

The sound quality is good for the price. The only issue I have is with songs that have a lot of bass. Since I didn’t buy these headphones for the bass, I’ll live with it.

I have headphones with and without the extra bands that go around the ear and I have to say I enjoy these a little better for working out. It gives that extra security even though they stay pretty well put anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The medium-sized earplug that came as default was a good fit for me.  It was very comfortable to wear and felt secure even with lots of head movement.

The controls were easy to access. The buttons were responsive and well placed.  Connecting to the phone was a cinch.  So far so good.

The sound.  This is where it falls short.  As soon as I heard the ""power on"" message from the earphone, I could tell this unit was going to be very bass heavy.  I do like lots of basses.  But the sound seemed muffled due to heavy throughout the entire range.  The highs don't sound crisp because of it.  I'm not sure if it's because the earphone hasn't been broken into yet.  These things take hours of playing time to get it broken into.  So I will update the review after I've used it for a while.

So to sum it up, this is a very well designed comfortable easy to use earphone.  The initial reaction is that the sound quality leaves something to be desired for.  But since this is an all around good unit, I'd like to give it a try and see if the sound quality improves over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I immediately liked the feel and look of these earphones. They work well, even sound great for being so small, the only thing is be careful for the instructions because I thought I had a defective piece but it was fine, just follow the instructions. The packaging was very great and sleek looking, the box it comes with for charging has magnetic holders for the earphones which works wonderfully. One thing that I noticed which might be just a phone issue is that sometimes there is skipping when the phone is in my pocket but otherwise I can leave my phone and go down the hall and the range is good. I personally recommend the earphones based on my experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These headphones are better than I had even hoped considering the cost of the product. They have a very good range. I've walked 30ft away from my phone and had no issues with losing the signal. Additionally, I was surprised that they came with a nice hard shell case. They stay in my ears while running/working out, and I've yet to drain the battery of the headphones even after using them for about 6 hours over the course of three days. Not sure how long the battery is supposed to last, but that seems pretty good to me considering the price point. It's also nice that I can pause music or video with the button on the side of the headphones. Very pleased so far, and I would definitely recommend them to friends.

Update: I left my phone in the house and walked outside, 30-40 feet away and was still listening to my music on these headphones. I've also run in the rain with them on and had no issues. I keep liking them more and more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Like other comments/raters making phone calls was problematic as I was frequent told that I was difficult to hear or that it sounded like I was ""talking in a can."" Decent battery life as well.

My biggest issue is (in my experience), these headphones are TERRIBLE for running because they fall out of your ears! I am a runner so this is a hugeeee issue for me, as the primary reason I purchased these headphones was for running. I have normal shaped ears, the ear buds just do not mold/fit in ears. I've tried literally everything to try to have the headphones stay in and on my ears, nothing has been successful. The over ear-portion of the headphones does not adjust-and unless you have larger ears-there is no way they will fit. I've grown to be so frustrated while running and the constant (literally every 5 seconds) readjustments and pushing the headpiece in my ear that I am purchasing new headphones because currently my runs end in me having to complete my runs with my headphones shoved in my sports bra.

Moral of the story - fine for gym but if you are a runner BEWARE! and purchase other headphones :)","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are amazing headphones!","April 14, 2019","I wanted to test them before I left a review. I'm so happy with this purchase. I leave these on all day and I wear glasses. They are so comfortable on my ears with my glasses too.

Great sound and love the noise cancellation. Bought a pair for two relatives and they love their gift.

I bought an extra pair to switch when the other one needs charging.

I can watch TV or listen to music and I don't have to disturb others.

If anyone has Roku and the Roku app on their phone with the headphones button on the Roku app. Just pair your headphones with Bluetooth on your phone, open the Roku app on your phone, tap on remote, tap on headphone icon and enjoy late night movies without disturbing others. I don't even plug headphones into the Roku remote anymore.  You can watch any app you have downloaded on your Roku and listen wireless with these headphones.  The movie/show pauses when a call comes through. If it's a short call it resumes and if it's a long call you may have to use the Roku remote to resume play.

I workout with these headphones too. So glad I don't have to keep pushing them in my ear or worry about them falling out.

I did not expect this from the price I paid for these headphones.

I may update this later in six months. My Dr wired headphones last for years. This is my first pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones.
Hopefully these will last too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

They work flawlessly with my iPhone not only when I’m listening to music but also while using Siri and during phone calls. The only thing that’s really not even a bad thing, is just that you can’t control the volume from the earbuds directly.
Other than my phone I have to say that I’ve used them with my laptop and they do cut a little bit while watching videos but that’s probably my laptop.
Overall great product for that price. I am definitely not spending almost $200 for the new Apple AirPods when the option for this really good queality product is out there.
Also battery life seems pretty good, I haven’t had them due on me given the amount of time I’ve been using them. I got them on Sunday (way before the stimated time) and I have only charged them twice. Once when I got it even thought it they had battery and the second time yesterday but it was just to make sure they were fully charged, so it’s been a few days of good use and they are still going.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-LETSCOM-Waterproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B07JGR4MLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
