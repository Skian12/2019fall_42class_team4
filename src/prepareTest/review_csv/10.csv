Except one thing...","November 2, 2018","I love these headphones! They are nice at work to drown out the sounds of the cube farm. They hold a nice charge. I ordered these in January and, even with daily, cordless use with Bluetooth connected to my phone, I've only had to charge them three times! They are fairly light but I do move them around a bit during use or I get a sore spot on my head. The volume controls for the music are perfect. It's a bit weird to have a phone conversation with them on because it's hard to hear yourself talking to the person on the other end. They can hear me just fine I just have to be careful not to yell. I didn't purchase them for phone conversations so it's not a big deal.

So, they're near perfect. Why did I give them 4 stars? I had to knock down my rating from 5 stars to 4 because the voice prompts are obnoxiously loud! If I'm listening to my usual classical music and a call comes in on my cell phone (I'm obviously connected via Bluetooth) I nearly hit the ceiling because the voice prompt is so loud! When I turn the headphones on and off I put them over my leg and my coworkers a couple of cubicles away can hear the voice prompt. There is no way I can turn them on/off with the headphones on my ears.

They're great headphones, especially for the price, but I wish there was a way to turn the voice prompt down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Landry","Just STUNNING!","August 7, 2018","From the outset, let me say that I am not a headphone person, although I do own a number of headphone and ear bud types ranging from fairly low cost ones to some costing a few hundred dollars.  I do use them from time to time, but always felt restricted by the cable and by the inevitable discomfort if I wore them for any length of time.  I have never owned a Bluetooth headphone frankly because of the expense and my overall dissatisfaction with earphones.  For the record, I am a mid-60 year old audio-aholic (someone who loves music to the extreme in all forms and types and formats) and over the past few years have returned to my analog roots - vinyl (played on my several turntables and cartridges), and cassettes (played on nice Nakamichi systems).  But I also have my pulse on the digital front too with a number of DAPs, iPods, FLAC-capable systems and the like.  Bottom line, I know my music from 50 years of playing it.  So tonight, after my Mpow 059 headphones arrived from Amazon, I charged them for a couple of hours on my MacBook, paired them and turned on my large New Age Mix.  That was three hours ago, and these phones are effortless and transparent!  I have to say that I am blown away that for less than $30 I received one of the best-sounding, highest quality, most capable headphones I have ever purchased.  They truly are remarkable!  Are they as good as my higher end phones?  I will leave that for now, but something tells me that if you try these out, you will not touch your more expensive wired headphones for awhile!  Just saying....","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was  a bit hesitant with such a low price.  What a surprise!  I went for a walk and used them.  Excellent passive noise reduction.  The sound, we'll balanced.  I am a Bose fan, and that's the nearest I can compare to as far as balance.  The do not feel like a $30 set of headphones, very solid build.  I am going to order my own.  Currently I have the Quitecomfort - I believe 25 - not blue tooth.  If Bose is an A+, these would be a B+ to A-.  I think the passive noise reduction is actually better in these.  But when you factor in $30 - they are a better deal than the Bose and any other popular brand.  The only folks I would not recommend these too are heavy base loving folks and sound snobs for lack of better word.  The folks where it has to be perfect sound - they wouldn't even consider it.

What's great about these headphones is that they do a decent job (far better than the Plantronics I spent too much on!) and I don't worry they'll be stolen off my desk. And if they are, meh, I'll spend another $30 and get another pair. Seriously, that peace of mind is worth a lot. They pair gracefully with phone and computer, worked well for a Zoom meeting, worked well for listening to the KQED stream, my music library, and Spotify, and block out enough ambient noise to let me focus on my work. Plus, with Bluetooth, I can run to the bathroom when I need to without having them accidentally ripped off my head when I forget they're there. I got a deal and I think they were really only $28. For that price, I should've bought two. If they last five months, I'm winning. Totally competent, comfy to wear all day, and not so expensive you fret about them.

I use them twice a month for a live seminar I am required to attend via computer. This seminar didn't start until July and its April 1st, so you think they have been used literally 18 times. Well when I went to use them for my seminar last week, they have shorted out. :( The only way that they work and actually produce sound is if they are plugged up to the charger during use which totally defeats the purpose of blue tooth right? They have not been banged around or misused so there is absolutely no reason this should have happened, especially with such little use. Also, I have tried multiple charges and it makes no difference. The headphones just crapped out on me which sucks because they were so comfortable and produced great sound.

I love these headphones. The ear cups are super comfortable! No active noise cancelling; but with the over the ear model, it wasn't needed. I wear them everywhere! Doing yardwork, in the office to tune out loud colleagues, plane trips to block out sound, and everywhere in between. Couldn't ask for a better set! The only downside is I only ordered one pair for me. The kids can't wait for me to walk in the door from work.

I was going to wait until I had more time with them before posting a review. I received an email from the vendor (which is not always done) asking if I had received the headphones and if I had any issues with them. The email included a link and asked for a review and her I am. The headphones appear to be very well made of excellent materials. The instructions, although tiny as is common today, were adequate and  they paired to my Pixel II flawlessly. It was a bit more involved to pair with my laptop but that is Win10 and no fault of MPOW's. So far I am very satisfied and would recommend them. I will update this review after using long enough to accurately comment on battery life. 08MAY2019 Update on battery as promised.

At an entry level price, you get good sound and long battery life.  It doesn't have the really deep bass like some other headphones do, but they offer decent balanced sound.  If you wear them for more than an hour, it could start to hurt your ears if you have larger ears.  If you use the bluetooth feature, make sure you either turn your headphones or phone volume all the way up to maximize your volume.  With one turned all the way up then you can control the volume with the other device.

They pair really fast with an iPhone 6S Plus and they have audio cues to let you know what mode the headphones are in.

Making a call was clear, but having my voice muffled by the over-the-ear style headphones isn't ideal for me, so I probably wouldn't use them for long calls.

While they don't have active noise cancellation, they do a good job at keeping background noise out because of the style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Bluetooth on these is way better then the old pair you can actually walk 20-30 feet from the device even with a wall I'm between, where the old model had trouble if I put my phone in my pocket. Sound is similar to the old pair it's pretty good but not amazing sounding. I like the headphone controls they are more intuitive then most I have seen, although you do hear it pretty loudly when you click a button with the headphones on. One con that I noticed is that if you use these while working out your ears will get pretty sweaty. Update. I've had these over a year now, and I am really impressed with these headphones. I actually changed it from 4 to 5 stars, I stand by everything I said before, and if I were to add anything I would say they aren't very noise isolating, but overall I have been very satisfied with their performance and battery life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Other than this, I really liked these headphones.  They are comfortable, I can hear the sounds clearly, and they hold a charge for a long time.  I am in the habit to charging them once a week but I really do not have to.  They really last for a long time and I use them everyday. They are also sturdy but fold up nicely for storage.
Honestly, they are great headphones especially given the price point. I cannot imagine how more expensive headphones could be any better.
Still, the random disconnecting was a major frustration.  After posting my initial review, the seller contacted my to let me know they had sent out new headphones since mine were malfunctioning.  I had not asked for anything so I was surprised.
That set did not arrive.  I assume that they were delivered to my old house.  When the seller  contacted me again to see if the new headphones were okay, I thanked them but let them know that it is likely that the person who bought my old house received a pleasant surprise.  I figured that would be the end of it.  The seller emailed me that they would send another set of headphones out to the correct address.
They did just that.  I have to say that I was not expecting the customer service that I received.  I have to give them a big plus on this.  I feel that they really went out of their way to fix the issue I was having.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I got a replacement pair of these. The sound quality is better, but still don't work for my conference calls. The sound is ""tin"" like and I sound very far away from the mic in my tests, as if I am yelling across a table to be heard.

For movie watching/music listening, these are fine. They fold, becoming more compact, and have a carrying pouch. Again, better sound than my original pair, but not amazing.

I currently use a Corsair headset, and the sound is amazing both for conference calls and while music/movie listening.

**ORIGINAL REVIEW**
I use these for audio calls on my laptop (for conference calls) as well as listening to movies on my tablet. As far as sound quality for listening to movies, they are fine but not stellar. They don't have a great range for sound quality and often loud but not clear; there is not a subtleness to the sounds.
When I am on conference calls, people often say they are unable to hear me and the sound quality is muffled.
I would not buy this product or from this company again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I’ve had these for about a week now. I work outside half the week doing mowing and other things as a building manager. I wanted something that would last all day and muffle noise from the mower.
So let me say for the price these work great. Comfortable, look great and don’t fall out my ears like buds. The battery lasts me a 8 hour day easy so far. I’ve seen people huffing over having to charge them after a day but really what don’t you charge after a day of use? I like the functions and that I can move threw my songs without touching my phone. The range for me seems pretty good at least 20’ and the connections strong even with a mower running. The sound is to be expected for $37. I mean come on you didn’t expect them to be like beats,jbl,or bose did you? But for the price they pump pretty good and muffle outside sounds decently. I can hear my music very well with a motor right behind me so I’m pretty pleased. I can’t tell you the  Long Jevity of them yet but I hope they hold up.
For the record I only use these with my phone wirelessly so that’s what my experience is based on.
Just a quick update. Still great headphones but sadly already stopped charging. I’m a little disappointed as they are not that old and only used once a week at best.

He uses them DAILY, and we’ve never had even ONE issue! As you can imagine, he’s a kid...He treats his possessions pretty well, but still...Daily use, for over an entire YEAR, and ZERO problems!?!? I would buy these again and again. The sound is so good...No kidding here, they rival my Beats! These are the absolute BEST bluetooth headphones especially for the price. Plus, green is his favorite color, and they match his iphone case perfectly!
He needed headphones for school this year, and I wanted to buy him the same ones, but just with a traditional cord, and without the Bluetooth feature, but unfortunately they only make a Bluetooth version (or if MPow does, I can’t find them)! and his school requires then to have a cord. These are possibly the most value I have ever gotten out of buying an item for him, and he has every game system on the market plus soooo many accessories...These have never let us down, and they are at an unbelievably good price, especially when you look at all of the usage they’ve endured...We’ve brought them with us on vacations, to doctor appointments, you name it. Never ONE problem with the sound, connectivity, or anything else. They’ve been dropped, they’ve been grabbed by his friends back and forth (playing...ya know, kids), and they amaze me, because they sound GREAT and are still going strong, AND the mechanisms that fold them down still feel and work like the day they came out of their box!!

I own 3 different pair of wireless bluetooth headphones and these are by far my favorite. I bought these as an additional pair just to use at night in my bedroom. Kudos to the Amazon Firestick for having bluetooth capabilities as I got these specifically to avoid keeping my wife awake while I routinely stay up sfter she's sleeping watching one thing or another. They paired with no issues at all and have never dropped their connection. They are smart in the way of managing the battery life as I frequently just take them off and lay them on my night table without worrying about shutting them off. They have literally never run dead on me and I've gone days without charging them. When I do charge them I've never had an issue with one micro usb cable or another not charging them well... some devices dont charge well if you don't use the supplied cable - these don't seem to care at all what cord I use. They sound great and fit comfortably. The range is good as well... sometimes I'll get up to use the bathroom and they have never cut out. Sometimes I'll go downstairs and make a sandwich - still good to go at probably around 40-50 feet. Ive even stepped outside to the back deck for a smoke and occasionally it will start to cut out at that point... that's pretty understandable in my opinion. When that happens i just press the middle button on the left ear and it pauses whatever im watching.

My only negative is that sometimes I want to turn the volume very low. While using these the TV volume has no effect on the headphones, you only volume up or down using the buttons on the left ear. My only complaint is that the lowest they go before going to mute could be lower. It goes from moderately low to mute with one additiinal click. Thats pretty negligible to me when considering the overall capabilities of these headphones.

If youre looking for a great set for an even greater price, look no further.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

1. Maybe i have large ears, but they end up getting squished a tiny bit when i wear these, so over a long period of time, it hurts, but that may be just me. otherwise, it isn't too bad, fairly comfortable.
2. BLUETOOTH audio quality sucks. It works, and it plays music with no issues over long ranges, so A++, but the sound is tinny, and hollow, and there is static and crackles intermittently (and i'm sitting right next to my phone when it happens... not moving, nothing between phone and headphone)

Good news: the WIRED audio is fantastic. Sounds exactly as it should, no special audio tweaks required, and reproduction of all frequencies is on point. so, if you want a cheep pair of wired over-ear headphones these aren't bad! if you want high quality wireless audio, I don't think these are the ones for you.
I'll update this if i find a new place or situation where the wireless audio improves, but so far, i would not recommend.

The Audio Techinc M50s are amazing, but this very inexpensive MPOW headphone is very good too...it's not as responsive on the high end, but really, for the price, it's absolutely wonderful.

Almost a year later, I'm still using these EVERY DAY, and they sound great!  I'm not really sure if the noise cancelling even works...I think most if from the isolation of the over-the-ear cushions, but the result is good for me. The bluetooth picks right up, never a problem with paring.  Both ear pads wore completely out, but weren't too hard to replace.

This paid off! My daily use in these have been for the gym. Even with all the sweat and cardio/weightlifting they do not slip off my head, which was my biggest concern. Sound is more than enough to drown out TV's, gym dance music plus your screamers! This also takes phone calls and no issues with people hearing you. I have also used the aux cable with my computer, also no issues i.e. crackling. This is an amazing headset for the price! If you want to spend another $200.00 for a higher end pair you can probably get a LITTLE lighter pair but these are not heavy to begin with. Ear are probably made for medium or small so if dumbo is your thing I would recommend something else.

Cons: Too tight. Not recommended for long-time wearing.

The customer service team offered me a chance to try MPOW H1, after knowing that I'm unhappy with 059, which is really sweet.
And I have to say MPOW H1 is really fantastic! I love this product.

1. MPOW H1 has a more natural sound. This is only a personal taste though. If you prefer more bass, maybe you should choose 059.
2. H1 is lighter and more comfortable. It has more flexibility than 059, which makes it more adjustable for people with a bigger head (like me).
To me, these are crucial improvements compared with 059. Now I can enjoy wearing it all day long~

Highly recommend H1.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Bluetooth connectivity works with no trouble, and the option of pairing with multiple devices is appreciated. The microphone is sufficient for voice chatting (1ch 16bit 8000hz, aka Telephone Quality)

My main complaint with these headphones is the sound quality change that happens while you're using the mic. While using them as merely headphones, you can get readonably clear (2ch 16bit 44100hz, aka CD Quality) audio playback - the speakers themselves sound awfully tinny and weak, but at least the playback quality is acceptable. However, as soon as you activate the microphone, the quality drops significantly (to 1ch 16bit 8000hz, aka Telephone Quality, to match the microphone.) Imagine that instead of listening to your favorite track on a normal pair of headphones, you're listening to it through your phone speaker, transmitted from your friend who's holding their phone up to their laptop speakers - it's awful.

Honestly, you're better off spending more money on better gear, if you have the option - but if you don't, just know that you can either use this set as mediocre headphones, or an adequate headset for voice chat - never both at the same time. If you like to listen to music while your game and wan to still leave your mic active, you should look for a different product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I consider them my “Leave me alone” headphones when I’m in public.  I’ve put these through mild to moderate use for the last few months.  They’re lightweight and feel inexpensive.  In hindsight, I wish that I had purchased a color other than red because now I realize they look like a pair of Beats knock-offs.  The sound quality is good, though you won’t get very deep bass. The call quality is excellent.  The controls are functional and straight forward.  The battery life is amazing.

Though I mentioned that they feel light and inexpensive, I like the way they feel.  Being so lightweight makes them very agreeable to wear and doesn’t give me a headache from the pressure and weight.

As I’ve said, you don’t get very deep bass, but more than half of the content I use these headphone with are audiobooks.  Even when I do listen to music, I am not displeased with the sound.  Granted, much of my music doesn’t emphasize deep bass, but my point is that these headphones are good enough that I never really think too much about sound quality.  And again, call quality with these are excellent.  Even better than I anticipated.

I had to consult the manual to know how to consistently summon Siri, but otherwise, the controls are very intuitive.  Honestly, it’s hard to mess up.  Five buttons: Volume up, down,  Forward, Back, time sensitive play/pause button that functions as an on-off switch and voice command prompter.

The battery life is amazing.  I’ve actually never depleted the battery.  If you leave it on standby without plugging it in for a week or so, it will still hold its charge.  On the iPhone, it even displays a battery percentage meter.

My ONLY complaint:  They really have no passive sound cancellation.  External noises are slightly muffled, but really they’re quite meager in terms of sound dampening.  I was not expecting  anything resembling Bose noise cancellation at all, but given the size of the headset and the large over-ear muffs, I really did think that they would passively block a little more external sound.  But when the music is playing, you don’t notice too much, so even this is fine.

If I had excessive splurging money this year, maybe I’d have gotten a Bose headset, but at $30, I don’t think there is a better deal out there for the time being.  I’ll use them until they break, and keep recommending them to people at least until that time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They didn't really cancel noise, but I didn't get them for that anyway (I hate the kind that go IN your ear- so these were perfect). Then about 2 months in, the music started to sound muffled. I don't listen to super loud crazy music, and nothing happened to the headphones to cause this. They were working fine at work, I went home, I came back in in the morning and they no longer worked. Despite my attempts to problem solve, I was unable to fix. The sounds distortion really just makes these unusable.
It's probably worth paying more for a pair that will last.

This is puzzling because when I plugged it in to my LG V30 with a wired connection, I could get high quality audio through the quad DAC that sounded nearly as good as my wired studio monitor headphnes that cost over a hundred dollars more.  That sound quality is pretty fantastic for a headphone in this price range in my experience, but I didn't buy this because it was a good wired device, I bought it for the wireless capabilities, and there, it seems to lag considerably in quality.  I've used ten dollar sets with crisper sound.  I'm not comparing this to high-end Bluetooth numbers, or even phones with aptX or AAC.  Until recently, my go-to was a pair of 18 dollar, behind the head headphones which had better sound quality.  This is a major problem for me.

Otherwise?  This is a decent set of headphones.  The build feels pretty sturdy and I'm not worried I'm going to break them, the wired sound is impressive, and the battery life seems at least standard.  It's hard to completely judge, though, as I find the wireless sound unsatisfying enough that I've not listened for long periods.

My other major complaint is with the on-ear controls.  I like the ability of wireless headphones to control music right from the set or bud, as it allows me to stick my phone in my pocket and just leave it there.  This set has a ring that makes it difficult to press only the button you want.  The ring is flush enough with the rest of the device that  have difficulty finding it with lightly guitar-calloused fingers, while other sets are not so much of a problem here.  If there is any raised or indented pattern to tell which button you're hitting, it's also too fine to be detected through what are some fairly mild callouses.

All things considered, I can't recommend these headphones, but they're not the worst I've ever used.  The wired functionality does mean I don't have to take out my more expensive headphones for decent over-the-ear sound.  It just means I have to sacrifice quality audio, which is already at a premium in wireless sound.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I evaluate specs in paper vs how the really sound, fit, built and cost. I needed an economical set for my son so he can beat the crap out of them without breaking the bank. I said to myself. ""Well they might not be as good as some other more expensive models"", but I was wrong. I am amazed with these.

These headsets have the ability to work wired or wireless which is a big plus. In wireless mode (Bluetooth), the battery last pretty much what they advertise and the phone, track and volume control and microphone works amazing. Also they very easy to pair. In wired just plug the 3.5mm cable in to the outlet and done. They are very comfortable and not as heavy as they look. What I do not like is that the outer side of the headband is a finger print magnet.

I haven't yet tested its bluetooth capabilities, but I will do so and rework my review to reflect that.

I used to rate these at 4 stars, but... While I love and support the Mpow headphones, this set is falling a bit short for me. It's supposed to offer bluetooth support for both my phone and my computer, but it often will only play sound from one, and not the other. If I try to switch back and forth between my phone and my computer, there are definite issues, and I usually have to turn my headphones completely off in order to reset everything to working order.

Also, very disappointed that the exterior covering is coming unglued on the headset's crown area, and I have attached images showing the ungluing. Overall, I loved this headset, but it's not as good as I thought it was when I first received them. Downgrading to three stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

When the headphones came out of the package, I was very surprised by how nice it looked. The design is sleek, the material feels fairly sturdy, and the interface is simple and easy to use. When I put it on it fit very snugly without clamping too tightly, and was warm but not uncomfortably hot. It even came with split audio and mic jacks instead of one dual jack. It was very promising and had all the makings for a great pair of headphones, but when I actually tried listening to it I was sorely disappointed. It's like when they were designing this thing, they blew all of their budget right before they got to the sound part. The audio is tinny, scratchy, and overall just sounds incredibly cheap, especially around the midrange. There is a constant hissing when sound is playing, and to be honest it just has the audio quality of something you can buy at the dollar store. I think I wouldn't have been let down as much if the headphones itself also looked shoddy, but it didn't. A shame that something with such a slick design left so much to be wanted in terms of where it actually mattered.

If the makers of these headphones read this, I want you to know that I would gladly pay double the price for these if you make one with at least acceptable sound quality.

Edit:
The customer service however, is top notch! They sent me a new pair immediately after my review.

I bought Mpow 059, H17 and H12 headphones for comparison But ultimately settled with the H12.

The H59 was comfortable and the flatter padding on the headband was desirable to me. These do not have ANC. The sound was overly full, muddy at some points and lacked clarity. The volume is louder than all my other Bluetooth and hurt my ears if I did not trun it down when switching from the other devices. I sent them back!

The H12 is what I ended up liking the most. I wish the headband pad was a little flatter because rounded padding prickles my short hair but beyond that they are comfortable.
The ANC takes almost 2 seconds to turn on and then it provides an ambient white noise similar to what you hear in your speakers when a tape deck is played with no tape or at the start/end of recording. It will completely eliminate the sound of my computer fans, refrigerator, air conditioning  and water cooler. I can still hear voices and some other noises like loud cars and bathroom fans but any amount of music will drown those out if the ANC is already on.
The H12 naturally has a very Full sound, but if bass boost is used the bass can bleed into mids and sound muddy. In my opinion the ANC enhances mids and most music sounds best with ANC on and PC sound enhancements disabled. I could probably expect higher quality sound out of these but I'm still enjoying it and the price was right. One thing to add, Harsh noises, like if someone adjusts a mic/camera in a video, come across startlingly convincing almost as if you think someone is tapping/ grabbing on the headphone frame itself. This was also the case with the H17

On the H17 first thing I noticed was the stitching around the ear muffs, unlike the pictures stitching was over tight and it drug on my fingers, I could feel its texture on my head too and I did not like it. The ear openings are too round and did not go around my ears as comfortably either. The headband padding was curved and ribbed and I did not like it on my short hair. As a positive the ANC switches on much faster but its performance was equal to the H12 ANC. Sound quality was a little deeper and fuller than H12 some may like this but I thought it was too much.  Much like the H12 I think the H17 sounds best with ANC on and PC sound enhancements disabled. I did not keep these long enough to appreciate the fast charging feature but I'm sure It would be nice to have.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

1. The sound in the right ear is way lower than the left ear. It’s been like that since the day I received them. I can barely hear out of the right ear.
2: They heat up very fast. I’m not talking an hour or so of use, my pair heats up after 10 minutes of use. The headphones get so hot I have to take them off.
3: The padding is very stiff and hard making them uncomfortable on the skin.
4: They are very very uncomfortable. My heads not that big yet they squeezed on my jawbone (by the ears) so bad I couldn’t wear them longer than a few minutes. My jaw was hurting for quite sometime afterwards.

Sooooo...I found these headphones on Amazon, and they had a great rating. Bought a blue tooth thingy to connect them to the TV.
I saw my brother smile for the first time in forever. He was able, even with his hearing loss, to hear the TV. Even if he goes down the hall to another room, the voice from the TV carries.

They are so comfortable! The clarity is outstanding. The range is waaaaay more than I would have thought possible.
I would recommend these for anyone hearing impaired- the difference between silence and being able to interact with sounds from TV, or radio would make a huge difference for the hearing impaired.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

All High End.","June 21, 2018","5 stars for comfort. 1.5 to 2 stars for sound. My $9 Skullcandy earbuds have better sound than these headphones. The bass is flat. I'm going to probably return these because the sound is garbage. It's all high end. Even with an EQ app on my macbook it's still terrible. Put my little $9 earbuds in and the sound is booming. I bought these because of all of the positive reviews. So I'd have to say if you don't care about bass and you want comfort, then these could be your headphones for sure. However, if you want at least some bass then you'll be better off looking elsewhere.

Downgrading this to 1 star because now I found out I have to pay to ship these back to the seller.

The price is good. Maybe a little more expensive than when Senty had them on Amazon..I also notice that it is inferior to the Senty brand of the same design and battery capacity. The Senty brand had noise cancellation on the microphone for phone conversations.

This one does not have the feature of noise cancellation.  You need to be where the noise is minimal. I wonder why they made this product without noise cancellation. I use to enjoy talking in the Streets of Manhattan without people complaining about the background noise on the Senty model.
I MPOW-059 is good forlistening.
Is this brand owned by Amazon or what?.
Overall, you do get good sound without needing to hear the base on a loud speaker.
The headset tends to get a short circuit, and leaves a little lighting on where bluetooth signal lights blink from.  Now, a year later, this headset is starting to turn off by itself.  Also, the color pad on the headset has unglued itself. I am hoping MPOw will replace my headphones. The similar brand called Senty, never gave me this trouble with its durability.

Expensive ones have broken; cheap ones have held up for a while.  But I still ended up needing a pair of inexpensive, bluetooth headphones to use when watching TV or listening to music while going to sleep.  These were cheap (about $35) but had good reviews so I decided to try them.

What a surprise.  Decent sound quality (I'm older and my hearing isn't what it used to be, but they have reasonably solid bass and the frequency response seems smooth to me).  The sound quality isn't what you'll get from really high grade headphones but the build quality is good and it is, after all, being used with an iPhone playing mp3s.  And it is quite an upgrade from using earbuds.

I'm pretty sure I could not have gotten a better value for the money.  They are solid and although I've only had for a couple months, I think they're going to hold up well over time.  Pairing is easy and they don't seem to require recharging too frequently.

Anyone who has $40 or $50 expectations should be very pleasantly surprised with both the sound and the build quality on these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Nice looking. I wouldn’t buy again or recommend unless it was for a child or someone who listens to audiobooks.
Some of you will understand this and some of you won’t: good music with good headphones can inspire you and make you really appreciate an artists voice. Good music with poor headphones does neither of those. My test is simple, go to the gym or go on a run and listen to some high energy music. Does the song sound great and make you want to keep pushing? Put on Mama Said Knock You Out by Ll Cool J. Do you want to do what mama said to do? Play Enter Sandman by Metallica. Do you want to say, “wow this was an awesome song!”?! Or do you say, “meh, that song is old and dated”?
If great music has no more effect on your ears, spirit, or soul than a Celine Dion song (no offense Celine) than you have some bad earphones.

So I'll say that, while these aren't exactly the audiophile's dream, they ""ain't bad for the price"" at all.  So if you get a pair that sounds like a tin can at first.. disconnect and ""re-pair"" them.  It did the trick for me. I'd recommend them for the parent who need's a headset for their kids.

The battery life is ABSURDLY LONG, even with daily use I maybe charged them every 2 weeks and they charge quickly.
The sound quality for $40 headphones is excellent! They pair easily with bluetooth and you can have multiple devices programmed into the memory to swap pretty easily. The low end bass isn't necessarily great but that isn't too much of a setback. If you have an android device with Dolby Atmos it really does make a difference to switch that on.
The ear pads and top pad are pretty tough, after months of daily sweat and heat abuse (I sweat... a lot) they haven't had any visible deterioration, which is impressive if you are the kind of human that wears full sized phones to the gym.

To add to all of this.. I was out for a walk and got caught in a HEAVY rainstorm that soaked the headphones. They worked for another few days until they needed charged and that is when I realized that the charging port was dead (presumably because of said rain) and I was not too bummed out, they are just $40, I'll buy another set!

Before I did that, I reached out to see if the company had any ideas or could possibly just send me a replacement port that I could install but instead they just sent me a WHOLE NEW pair of headphones! Great and responsive customer service that I definitely did not expect from this price point. Also, the old headphones still work if they are connected with the included audio cable. They only need to be charged and 'on' for the bluetooth to work. They've certainly got my business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are comfortable against the ears and the sound quality is great. There's also a remote on the headphones to change volume & songs or answer phone calls. The noise cancellation works well too, but I haven't tested them with extremely loud noises. Just basic stuff like using a vacuum while cleaning up. Of course, if they'll silence a vacuum, I have all the confidence in the world that they'd work on a flight with small children, in a crowded gym, or any other noisy situation you can think of. I can't speak on how well the battery lasts, as I'm pretty diligent about charging them after each use, but they do have a cord just in case they die or you can't charge them. Also, for the runners and bodybuilders, I have no idea how these hold up to moisture, so maybe be mindful of sweat and dry them after each use. Definitely give them a tight fit on the head and try not to leave them battered and bruised. I haven't tested durability either, but dropping electronics is never good for them. Especially cheap electronics. Lol

These have tons of good reviews for a reason. So far, I'm satisfied. They seem to be made well and I know that they work well, so they're more than worth thirty bucks. Like most anything, if they're taken care of, they should be fine. If they commit some grave offense in the near future like not holding a charge or literally falling apart, I'll come back and tell you about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I really really love these headsets with my compute. They work great for both gaming and streaming the type of music i listen to. I was worried from some of the reviews that music would be an issue but i have not heard an issue with sound. So there is that. As for fit, they fit perfect and cover my ears perfect i suppose someone with a larger head and bigger ears might disagree with me. I read a few of the not so great reviews and people complained how cheaply made they were and easily they broke. Call me an optimist but i dont see that happening unless you just carelessly fling them around and dont take care of them.

Now for the bad...I honestly dont know if its the headset or if its the fact im connected to two devices or if its because my phone is just a piece of...but while im on my computer and the phone rings, when i push the button and it answers the phone, it works perfectly the way it should answering the phone and turning sound off from the computer. That being said though, i am told by those i talk to using the headset that i am sounding like a robot and shakey or they are having trouble hearing me. I have the same results though when i hear them. I also find it difficult to see the usb port where its located.

I gave the headset 3 stars for the reason of the bad. I bought it both for use with my computer and my phone but when i have to select using the phone during a call and cant use the headset as intended or like i was hoping to do so that my hands could be free to continue playing a game or so that i could walk away from the phone cause its on charge it sort of defeats the purpose of why i bought the headset. Yes i also needed it for gaming nights with friends on discord and streaming music but the number one reason was for phone use.  -sighs- i guess i cant win them all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Immediately, I knew this would be a distraction to me - both hearing everyone enter and exit the office and then having everyone think they can talk to me. So I wanted an over the ear set of headphones that 1) would cancel/block some of the noise, 2) would let people know I was listening to music, 3) had great sound quality, and 4) didn't break the bank. This set was exactly that - and it came in my favorite color, pink!

This set pairs great with my iPod and my iPhone - even better, I was able to figure out how to pair it with my laptop for those late phone-in meetings. That said, I've found that the bluetooth sound quality in phone calls was not as good as the line in, but I think we all understand that issue.

The battery lasts a LONG time - I have never had it quit on me (but then, generally, I plug it in during lunch). I don't hear my coworkers nearly so much, but can still hear my desk phone. And people know now that I'm not just ignoring them because I don't like them, I'm listening to music. If there are negatives, they are 1) that the design causes my hair to get caught and and 2) the discomfort on my ears when I wear really dangly earrings.

Overall, this set has been fantastic - I never imagined using them for conference calls, but they've worked great!

After leaving a mixed review, a representative contacted me to tell me they had shipped me a new set of headphones to replace my faulty ones. I've since received the new headset. Hopefully this pair lasts!

I appreciate the good customer service, proactively replacing my clearly faulty headphones with new ones. The new set seems to work well. The one thing that makes this headset less than ideal is that it doesn't always work well when you have two devices paired—sometimes you can't pair the second device without disconnecting, and any sound from my phone causes the sound from my computer to stop until I disconnect the phone. They're still pretty great, though, within that small limitation! Good sound, nice look, good customer support, great price point. I definitely recommend them.

Original review:
I bought these earlier this year and really, really loved them for a while. Good sound, great for calls, comfortable, nice color, great battery life, excellent price point. I recommended them to several people. Then the fabric started pulling away from the band on top and exposing the foam underneath, which was a pain. But I superglued it back on cause hey, as long as they worked well, I was okay with them looking ugly. Then they stopped connecting to my phone via Bluetooth, which was...90% of why I wanted them. They still connect to my computer, but not reliably and with more static and dropping the signal.

Really bummed that they didn't last longer, because I really liked them and was otherwise happy with them. But if they barely last six months, that great price point suddenly looks a lot less impressive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

This headset is a winner. I use it almost exclusively while watching movies on my Amazon Fire. I have had no issues with Bluetooth connection. Because of the nice fit over the ears, most exterior sounds are blocked out.

I had to laugh at one reviewer's complaint that the headset ""jiggled"" while he ran. This set is no more designed for running than a pair of iron-tipped work boots.

And an additional feature which is very handy: If the battery wears out in the middle of whatever you are doing, you can plug these right into your system and keep on going. A cable is provided with the head set. This feature has kept me going several times.

The prices I see for ""name-brand"" headphones are just ridiculous.  Don't spend you hard-earned money for a name on the product. Keep about $270 in your pocket and purchase these for about $30.

Reference the Mpow H20 headphones.
5☆☆☆☆☆ rating!

Recently I was fortunate enough to receive a pair of (Mpow H20) wireless headphones to review as an alternative to the (059) model. While those were sufficient they are by no means in the same league as the (H20's).
The Mpow H20 headphones are in a word (Amazing)! The Highs are nice and crisp. The Mids are solid and the Bass is deep, low and rich in sound quality. I put these on the moment I received them, hit play on one of my favorite tunes and Bam! The smile that instantly came on my face was uncontrollable. They sound just that good! I couldn't believe it so I stopped the music and played another song from a different genre. And too my surprise, the smile was back! The feel is Premium to the touch. The build quality is Solid. And the Sound, Wow! I spent alot more money a couple of years ago on a pair of (Beats Solo 2) headphones. These Mpow H20 headphones blows them out of the water.
Also, I've noticed that the battery life is insanely long. I've gotten approximately 27 hours of (variable volume) use time, and there is still a charge on them. I also like how easy they instantly connect tho whatever device they were last paired to. They are the most comfortable over the ear headphones I have worn to date.
I Highly recommend the Mpow H20 headphones to anyone. They make a Great gift for anyone and to treat yourself to some quality sound.
Lastly I would be remiss if I didn't mention that there is no noise cancelling on this particular pair of headphones. But, that doesn't affect the range and sound quality of the headphones. If you really need noise cancelling, I'm sure Mpow has something that would meet your needs.

I went to turn these on and they randomly stopped working completely. They were fully charged and suffered no trauma. Just dead. I liked them a lot while they lasted but for the price I really expected longer life.

*Other info-
The manual controls on this unit (on the outer right side) are a power/connect button with phone and play/pause options in the middle, with volume controls on top and bottom, and a skip back and forward on each side.

I needed a pair of wireless headphones for my 2 year old, who has sensory issues. He loves to use them in crowds or places that have alot going on. He uses them both with and with out music. The headphones are adjustable and really soft, so the texture dosent up set my little one .I love them for long car rides so he can watch movies I dont have to worry about a wire. We keep them charged so for his pair we dont use the cord, he would chew thur it. I enjoyed them so much i got another pair in blue for my 8 year old. Now he is really hard on head phones, and after a month hes already messed up the cord to make them into wired headphones. I just bought a new one and so far so good. He uses them for on the bus and free time at home and can get a good 20 hours before  needing to charge them. The bluetooth has great range, he can be a room away and still work. He tho forgets alot to charge them so the cord option saves him. I waited alittle over a month to do a review to see how they held up, and I can honestly say they are great. They have been threw in pack packs and tossed around by a hyperactive two year old. They come with a nice little bag, charger, and auxiliary cord. They are not going to have the sound quality or noise cancellation like a $120+ pair. But they hold there own, they sound good, durable, fold up to a nice size, adjustable, bluetooth and comfortable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They came out of the box with 80% battery according to my phone and have only dropped to 60% after about 5 hours of use.

Right out of the box they were easy to connect, no fuss like many Bluetooth devices. They can also be connected to two different phones so you can share them with someone if need be. I did notice the ear pad that was on the inside of the fold was dented in where it had been packaged up for so long. I let it sit overnight and it went back to its original shape.

The headphones have separate volume settings than the phone you connect it to. So you can max then headphone's volume and then your phone's and it'll be blasting the music. Wouldn't recommend it for the durability of the headphones though.

I was afraid they'd be too small but they extend to fit a bigger head. They are a bit tight, which would be helpful if you're intending to use them for the gym. I mainly bought these for use at the gym so I'll update with how well they stay on my head through running, lifting, etc. However, if you get headaches or are sensitive to things being on your head a little tight, these might not be for you.

Update: at the gym. Working well for lifting weights and bike. They didn’t stay on my head when I did ab workouts though. They kept slipping off so I just took them off for that portion. Might be the size of my head though.

There is a 3.5mm port in the bottom of the left earpiece for an aux cord if you need to plug in to a non-Bluetooth device. I plugged it into my PS4 controller and I could hear my system audio. I haven't tested the mic for game chat yet, but I think it'll work. May update later once I test it.

Overall I like the functionality and feel of the headphones. They're comfortable, the sound quality is good for the price. Some sound escapes to the outside world but you can't hear anything outside of them when wearing them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I charGe it like once a week and I am good to go. The sounds quality at first is amazing but that lasts about 2 months. It is also pretty good at noise cancelling.

The cons:
1. The product fell apart on me after about 2 months. I mean physically fell apart as in the fabric starts falling off and then the cushion part starts falling off and I tried to work with it. I kept using it because sound was still coming out and for the price it is to be expected.

2. Then it started having problems connecting about a couple of weeks later. So it would connect to my phone and my computer and then automatically this connect itself and I would have to turn it off and start over. Then weirdly enough it started connecting directly with my phone as soon as I turned it on even though the bluetooth function on my phone was off, I tested it a couple of times and then saw that the actual bluetooth on my phone turn blue when the voice on the headphones says pairing (it creeped me out a lot).

3. After all of that, it started beeping and I have checked, its not the battery. It's this nonstop just beeping every couple seconds. You can't hear anything over the beep because it stops your thing that's playing to beep.

4.The customer service is not great. They offer to swap the product after 30 days but you have to pay for shipping to their warehouse in California which for me ends up being about half of the cost of product and they won't reimburse me for that full amount.

I know people want to say you get what you pay for but honestly not in this case. There are headphones under $30 that work well longterm without all of these problems and I didn't pay for bad customer service. I am not some know it all expert on headphones, I just want ones that work and I read a lot of great reviews which is why I went with this one but just know these things can happen. It was overall a really long, frustrating and negative experience.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But wow, these headphones have some of the worst audio stuttering I've ever encountered in a Bluetooth headphone. Broken, stuttering audio if you pause your media for over 3 minutes, forcing you to power cycle the headphones to re-establish a solid connection. Happens consistently, regardless of the battery level. Can't recommend with the frequency of stuttering that occurs.

Easy to set up the connection between my phone and these headphones and now they connect automatically every time I turn the headphones on. I like that there are buttons on the side of the headphone to play/pause, skip songs and adjust the volume. The buttons are a bit hard to feel at first since they're smooth but once you get used to the placement you can find the button you are looking for pretty easily. The headphones are comfortable for about 1.5 hours and after that they can make my ears hurt because they press down on them. I don't mind this because I only wear these on the train when I'm commuting and so I wear them for about an hour maximum at a time. If you are looking for headphones to wear all day these may not be for you because they can get uncomfortable after a length of time.

The sound quality is good and noise does leak if you play your music super loudly. But if you listen to it at a medium level the people around you should not be able to hear your music. I like that it comes with a cord to plug in if your headphones run out of battery. The battery lasts a long time. I get my full 15 hours worth of battery life out of my headphones before i have to charge them. I charge them about once a week. Overall, if you are not willing to spend a lot of money on headphones and just looking for something to do the job, these are a great choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Raising the rating by one star because of good customer service.

After leaving my initial review, I was contacted by customer service. They sent me an replacement (Mpow H2) for me to try. My original complaint was about sound quality. H2, in my opinion, indeed has better sound, but it's not nearly as comfortable as 059. I can't really recommend either. But again, there are budget headphones. Maybe I'm asking too much for this price range. I supposed this pair could be decent enough for a budget-oriented consumer.

--- original review ---

Initially, I purchased another pair of headphones on Amazon for less than half of what the Mpow costs. That other pair has OK sound but it's very uncomfortable and gets irritating very quickly. So I returned that pair and purchased Mpow instead based on the reviews.

As it turns out, Mpow is indeed quite comfortable which is a big plus. However, the sound quality is not good. What's particularly annoying is the fuzzy noise that comes on and off when it's connected through Bluetooth. If connected through the cable, the sound quality gets a lot better and the noise won't be there. But let's be real, I didn't buy these wireless headphones so that I can use them with wire. In fact, some other reviewers have also reported similar issues with the noise so I'm guess it's quite a common problem.

Ultimately, headphones are about the sound. If the sound isn't great, you wouldn't want to use it no matter how comfortable they fit on your head. Disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Two issues though:
1) when using via bluetooth on iphone 8, I find the sound quality to be very spotty to bad. The problem goes away when you send it to speaker or listen by wired headphone, so (at least for my 2 headsets) there is an issue when using this for iPhone 8.  Therefore, I use this only on the PC where the sound quality is fantastic. Note: I have had no issue with microphone in either case.
2) there is a notification in the box that you should only charge this with a 5 amp charger... which is fine. But they didn't put an actual 5 amp charger in the box. There is a usb charging cable only. It's pretty inconvenient to look around the house/office for a compatible wall charger when these folks could've easily included that in the box.

Otherwise, this is a great product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

There was a few instances (3 +/- times) on the first night I used them that the sound of the TV show I was watching went to full static (painful!).  I paused the TV show and started it again and the static was gone.  It only happened that night and I have used them maybe 4 or 5 more times since then.  Maybe it was interference from something nearby, I don't know...but so far, there has not been a repeat.
This is my first ever pair of Bluetooth headphones and probably only my second pair of over-the-ear headphones so I can't really compare the quality to anything else.  I will say that the seller Patozon seems to want to provide good customer service...they have already emailed me twice asking if all is OK and providing some tips.  I believe I also saw them reply to some reviews to assist people who have issues.  Would I buy another pair of Mpow headphones and would I buy again from Patozon...as of right now, YES.

The construction feels just a little chintzy. The buttons on the headphones are certainly not luxury class. But it’s not like the thing is falling apart.

Still kicking!!","November 16, 2019","So these are my go-to pair of headphones and I figure it’s just good karma to review it. These have held UP. I’ve had them for going on two and a half years.
I bought them originally to go with my iPhone 7 Plus, for getting around town and for exercise. I walk everywhere so it was very important to me that they were durable, and had a battery that lasted for a busy schedule and allowed me to lose track a bit. They lasted me through SEVERAL many walks to and from work, in all types of weather. They fold to fit in whatever bag I’m using; previous pairs I’ve had (not this brand) started to break on the hinges first and lasted me about half a year each. Not so here; they’re even reinforced by a couple screws on each side. I’ve went on distance runs with them, miles at a time. This week, they’ve lasted through four hour long runs with no Charger time.
I’ve dropped them quite a few times, and learned not to do that lmao, but they’re relatively unscathed (just a small crack on the bar). They’ve started rattling a bit over time, too, but it’s pretty minor and the sound usually drowns it out.

I love the fact that it's Bluetooth and wired so you can use it with older systems too.
Battery lasts a solid 8 hours at work with continuous play.
Over the ear fits nicely and is very comfortable.
The headband isn't snug or too tight like many are.
Sound is very good over Bluetooth from my phone.
You can control the volume and answer calls via the buttons built into the headphones.

Cons:
I had a bit of a hard time getting the Bluetooth to connect but once paired they work very well.
There is no tactile feature on the buttons so it's hard to feel if you are on the volume button or the on/off button.  It would be nice to have the buttons contoured in some manner to allow you to control without having to look.

I've got the new set in and it works great. Been using them over the other set I got on black Friday that hurts my head. I'd still recommend these as a good set of Bluetooth headphones.

Then I found an anime on chrunchyroll and binge watched it till around 0600. From the moment I put them on in the morning until I went to bed they were on Bluetooth battery only. They didn’t even give me a low battery warning. I ran outa power before they did. The old one needed a break during the day. The mic is much better as well. Hope this helps someone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These headphones are testing my patience. Let me start with the good then I'll talk about the bad.

Pros: They're pretty comfortable, they weren't that expensive, they look nice and feel sturdy.

Cons: They stop pairing with my bluetooth transmitters. I have 2 different brands of transmitters and for some reason these headphones will pair with one, work for a few hours then boom, it won't pair again. I've tried making sure both headphones and transmitters were fully charged but it's a no-go. The headphones like one-night stands with my transmitters. It will work once or twice then never again. I can't tell you how many times I've tried pairing these with the two transmitters I have and it just doesn't work. Then eventually, I can't even get the headphones to pair at all! It goes from Power On to Power Off.

Completely useless if I can't use the wireless option of these headphones. I'm very disappointed.

Update: The company sent me a replacement and it's been working great! I'm able to pair it with no issues. The first pair has again began pairing with my computer's blue tooth but still won't pair with my bluetooth transmitters but that's okay since the new pair works fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound quality is fine but not great (these are by no stretch of the imagination Bose headphones!), and they occasionally cut out for a moment here and there when on bluetooth mode. I use them for commuting on public transportation, and it's really nice not to have to deal with tangling cords with my bag, etc.. I also use them occasionally at my desk at work, and was worried about sound carrying over as some folks have mentioned, but I asked my officemates and no one could hear anything. I think as long as the cup is well fitted around your ear, no sound should come out. They're definitely large and in charge, but I prefer over-ear to on-ear, so that's what you get. They've held a charge amazingly well so far--I've used them off and on for over a month now and haven't yet had to charge them after their initial charge. The buttons are a little cheap feeling, and the voice confirmation of settings (power on, power off, etc.) drive me nuts, but overall they're decent enough and do the job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The headphones worked great for a few weeks. But less than a month after purchasing they did not work. I purchased a new aux cord to see if that was the issue. Still did not work. Only heard sound put of one side with no bass. I really liked the design and fit. I don't recommend this product.

I did a lot of reading and comparing before settling, so I hope they work out well for me.  So far I have had just a little time to use them but from my initial use I have found they are well worth the research.  I wasn't looking for the world's best but I wanted a good pair of headphones that both looked good but also sounded good.  I wear hearing aids so I wanted something that would fit over my ears and not on them.  I also wanted something that had good base, with highs and lows that would not torture my hearing aides and me. (Both blowing out my hearing aides or my hearing  as I am hard of hearing not deaf).

Other than the bit of white noise you experience (and it is really minor and low) in between song, quiet time during gaming and TV they are really great.  So realistic and all in time with the transmitter.  They were very easy to pair up with my Transmitter (also a Mpow) for my TV and also my PC. All my music sounds as good as with my other headphones that connect.  I also used the wire and no difference between wired and non-wired.

I keep these in the bag that came with them as I didn't opt to buy the hard cover (it was a separate.purchase) and I keep them in my home office. The controls are easy enough to keep in mind.... Volume up, down, skipping left or right....center on/off and phone calls. I also stayed with the basic color Red/Black as it was a bit cheaper but that is the color I was originally looking for. A bit sporty.  Everything is black anymore and hard to find so I wanted something that was color contrasting and easy to find/see.

So I am hoping to use these for a long time.  Maybe I got lucky and got a good pair for a good price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They're such high quality for the price. I love them, but the real endorsement comes from my boyfriend. He's a hardcore audiophile (thousands of dollars worth of speakers) and he was impressed with the sound quality. The noise cancelation is great, I was talking three feet away from him and he couldn't hear me! He has expensive Bose (corded) headphones and prefers these when he's mowing the lawn. Most over-ear headphones leave my ears sore, but these are large enough to fit over my entire ear and be comfortable. The range is pretty good, and man these hold a long charge. They do take four hours to get a full battery, but that's totally worth it. Seriously, you just can't go wrong with these. Just buy them already!
Update: My partner was so jealous of my headphones he went out and bought himself a pair of Bowers & Wilkins bluetooth headphones. Mine are still going strong and I use them at work every single day!

I never worked out.

But I used daily and loved. I loved the control options on the left ear. I loved how it transitioned to calls. I loved that I could walk without having to look at my phone.

Then my brother gave me his Beats Solo 3 headphones. I was excited.

Then I wasn't.

The MPOW headphones had more functions from their headset than the Solo³ and it was hard to go back from that. Unfortunately, I had given my MPOW to my youngest brother.

I continued to use the Beats but I just was not as happy as I was with the MPOW headphones. So I recently repurchased a pair that was delivered to my home yesterday.

So, I wanted to get him a cheaper set of wireless headphones he could use with his PC to play Fortnight and Roblox.  The reviews were mixed about these being useful for gaming, but honestly they are excellent for what I was looking for.  I was worried that the microphone might only work with phone calls, but that is not the case.  The headphone sound quality is very good, and even though there is no boom microphone, where ever the physical microphone is works just perfectly for him to chat in game.

All he has to do is remember to charge them overnight and he is good to go for at least 2 hours the next day (headset may go much longer, but that is his absolute max per day allowed), and simply has to press and hold the ""call"" button on the side of the headset to wake them back up and pair the headset/microphone with his Windows 10 PC perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Mpow headphones won't charge, making them useless.

Original review: I bought these for my long public transportation commute and for travel. I’ve listened to music and audio books with them, 2 hours a day, 3-5 days/week for apx 6 months. The sound is good quality for my purposes. The set seems to have confusion connecting if there is more than one device in the vicinity, for ex. if my phone and iPad are both close by. I have to turn off Bluetooth on the device I’m not using or my sound will cut out every 15 seconds for about 5 seconds. It keeps doing that until I disable Bluetooth on the other device. I’ve been somewhat displeased with the construction. The foam padding started falling apart after about 4 months. I’ve had to superglue the padding back together twice so far. I’ll keep doing so until the sound goes bad or the battery quits. But I won’t be buying any mpow products in the future for that reason. I expect things to hold together better than that. Overall they have been acceptable for the money, but I won’t be going this route again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

OK Sound Quality.","January 3, 2019","I feel like I shouldn't complain the sound quality of this headphones for the price, and I am honestly fine with the product in general considering how much I paid for it. However, it is true that I was disappointed at the sound quality. I had a high expectation after reading many rave reviews. But I learned my lesson... You can't expect that super WOW sound quality by paying only $40.
I still remember when I first tried a SONY Walkman to listen to my favorite piano cassette tape more than 30 years ago, it totally blew my mind, made me feel like I was at Gyorgy Cziffra's piano solo concert, and my head unconsciously moved to look up the ceiling with amazement.
I guess I was expecting the same kind of surprise from this headphones, but unfortunately it didn't happen... I guess I have to try one of those over $300 headphones to get that feeling again (if I can ever afford it...).
I am actually satisfied with the sound quality of this headphone when I watch TV dramas at night after my child went to bed, but not happy at all when I listen to piano music with this headphones. I am not an expert and can't find right words to describe it, but although it has great dynamics, the sound is far from the one to make you feel like you are actually at the piano concert.
Also, this headphones is a bit too tight on my head. I am a 5 foot tall Asian woman who has an average sized head for Asian (I think, lol), so not that huge head but not very small. It starts pressuring into my ear after an hour or so and since it's also heavy, the weight starts hurting my hair line unless I adjust and move it around over my head like every 20 minutes. I have't owned many headphones before, so I can't compare with others and am not sure if this happens with every headphones, but because of this hurting my ear and head problem, I am not sure if I should use this on the airplane (I have a 13 hour flight to Asia every year).
So, I have to say I would not recommend this headphones to people, but I totally understand the rave reviews for the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Except for one thing.

The color and finish of these headphones is admittedly beautiful.  Build quality while not the sturdiest is definitely good enough.  Comfort of the ear muff pads, perfect.  Controls are crisp enough to more or less know what you're doing blind (wearing them).  The battery life appears to be really really good (for as much as I've allowed myself to use them).  Bluetooth range is also very impressive.  Cannot comment on the quality of how I sound to callers when they call me as I don't think I've used them for that purpose yet.

The bad:
Sound quality, what...is...that???  To say they disappoint, is an understatement!  I can't even say they sound flat (little to no bass, as that is not entirely accurate), or dull (low or no treble, there is treble, but it is distorted).  The sound response curve doesn't even sound remotely flat.  There is some bass, but it is strongest around the highest bass frequencies, but then the mids are somewhat flat with the highs a little over pronounced.  It's so bizarre I could not get myself used to the sound quality and had to go back to my cheap pair of $20 Monsters even though they're wired only and I really wanted an equivalent set of Bluetooth headphones to use when wired was not ideal.

I cannot believe I had these in my wish list for months until the lightning deal happened based on a review that had these as the highest reviewed headphones on Amazon.  Only after buying another set of Monster Bluetooth headphones for a similar price did I finally notice the reviews for these that also state poor sound quality.  Also note, I experience the poor sound quality even when wired up!!!  So it's not due to a subpar Bluetooth chipset.  It's either due to cheap or poorly manufactured drivers or some kind of circuitry in between the wired input/Bluetooth output and the drivers that's distorting the sound.

So disappointing, I cannot recommend.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

*** Previous Review ***  I was not sure how to rate this, so I guess I will apply it to these specific headphones.  I have bought several Mpow products in the past, and I liked them.  They seem to be well made and well priced and worked out just how I hoped they would.  These headphones looked and felt decent when I received them, and I was excited to use them.  But they would never hold a charge, even after being on the charger for hours.  They worked fine when you used the regular headphone cable, and the Bluetooth worked when plugged in, but once off the charger they would not turn on.  I sent them back immediately but did not get a refund.  But that is another issue, not related to the product itself, and I will detail that in my Seller Review.

I have very loud children and there is only so much time I care to spend telling them over and over to quiet down (their favorite thing to do is to jump as loud as possible directly above my office...where their room is...and shake the ceiling above my head, giving me anxiety attacks).  Wouldn't you know it, I don't even have to turn the volume up all the way to completely tune them out.  They get to have fun and I get to not be the miserable parent who does nothing but scream at her children for simply being children.  Unfortunately, I can't wear them on my head too long because they are a snug fit and eventually give me a headache.  I did much better when I first wore them, lasting a few hours at a time, but now I can't wear them but 30-60 minutes before I have to take them off.  It's too bad because I was really happy with them at first.  Maybe they just need to be broken in by resting on top of something a little bit wider than my head for a few days.

The last set of wireless headphones I had had to connect to a base that transmitted the signal.  The base was connected to my computer and that's how they worked.  I had to turn off the sound on my speakers or sound would emanate from both places, defeating the purpose of wearing headphones.  Their range was crap and even when I was sitting directly in front of the base, they would crackle like a bad connection on a radio station.  This was long before Bluetooth and given how poorly those performed and their high cost (at least $80-$100) I wasn't sure what to expect with these.

Struthers","Downgraded: I would've keep buying and using these...  Three times the right/left speakers no longer work correctly.","June 18, 2018","I'm downgrading my review of these headphones.

Originally I thought these were great.  They sound, fit, and work as a headset in the greatest I could expect for the price...

BUT

I've seriously kept them folded up and in a case whenever I'm not using 99% of the time!

Three times now, for some reason, only one side works!  When using BlueTooth, only the right side works!  When using the stereo jack/plug, only the left side works!

I'm frustrated because they worked great, then I charged them before folding them and putting them in the case for the night.  On a random morning...

!!!POOF!!!

Only the right side works via BlueTooth.  OR Only the left side works with the wire.

Update on comfort, I've worn these almost 24 hours straight while traveling via Greyhound, playing audio the whole time.  That part is still great.

Original:
Here are the reasons why I bought these:
1. Bluetooth so I can go both hands and wire free to talk and listen to music.
2. Price and audio quality.  Other reviewers indicated the price and quality were great.  I agree!
3. Easy hands-free use.  Being able to adjust the volume and switch tracks without pulling out my phone is great!
4. Headset feature.  I love answering the phone and adjusting the volume without taking the phone out of my pocket or belt holster.
5. Comfort.  I wear these up to 6 hours at a time. They don't get very sweaty or cause discomfort wearing glasses.
6. Wired option.  I like this because if the battery dies (which it hasn't), I can plug them in using a regular audio cable.

They are over the ear and fit really well, even wearing glasses.  With my over the ear hearing aids, they're not as great, but I'll usually take those off just to have these on instead.

This silver pair are actually the 3rd set of this brand that I have had.  My original red pair had a problem after about 9 months of use.  (Perhaps a wire shorted out from folding it or wearing it while lying on a fluffy pillow?)

After 20 months of use one of our headphones is beginning to flake around the ear pads.  They still work but the earpads are not replaceable.  This is a shame because once broken in the cans are reasonably comfortable, provide good sound reproduction and block out outside noises.  At ~$35.00 a pair we got lots of use out of them and would still recommend them but be aware that once the pads are gone these cans will need replacing.  There are some other budget options with replaceable pads and these might be better for the environment.  Better still MPOW just redesign these to have replaceable ear pads.

My husband and I both have a pair of these headphones.  We like them.  They are comfortable (after they are broken in, they are a bit tight at first) sound good and work as well on Bluetooth as they do plugged into an audio cable.  To our geeky ears they sound good but we are not audiophiles.  The battery lasts a long time when used in Bluetooth mode and they do a relatively good job of blocking background noise.  I compared them with a pair of expensive Bose noise cancelling phones and discovered they couldn't completely block the baby crying behind my airline seat either.  For 10% of the price these do at least 90% of the job.  They may not be the sexiest headphones around but they work well and when we wear them out (one well used pair is already 1.5 years old and still holding up just fine) we would buy again.  We like these cans and would recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Short term use headphones but 4star customer service","November 21, 2018","**2nd Update 6/14/2019. Rating changed from 4 stars to 5 stars 6 months after receiving replacement pair. The replacement pair of headphones are still working perfectly. They are in use daily by a special needs child with sensory issues. They are used for multiple hours each day for school work, to play computer & video games, to listen to music, binural sounds and calming meditation music. They are taken on every single outing to be used either for their audio abilities while using electronics while we are out, as an aid for calming when sensory overload kicks in and even worn turned off just for their noise canceling abilities during musical theater, airports, and other noisy, crowded situations. And they are even slept in every single night (turned off) just to help block out noises that may awaken her. They do not fully block all sounds obviously, but they definitely muffle sounds and make it challenging to hear and understand if someone is talking to you or even notice any outside noises. Obviously, with the amount of use they get each day and the way they are used, they clearly hold up beautifully. No special care is taken with them. They are an essential part of daily life in our household and make life a little bit easier, more pleasant and navigable for our special needs child. When they do finally bite the dust, I will be replacing them with the exact same pair from Patozen due to the amazing way they have held up in the extreme usage they receive and for the awesome customer service I received from this company when I initially purchased this model and experienced issues with it. These headphones are worth way more than I paid for them and are priceless for what they've given my child.

*Rating changes from 1 star to 4 stars on December 2nd, 2018 due to excellent customer service actions to rectify unpleasant experience with headphones.**

Purchased the Mpow 059 August 28th, 2018 due to the majority of favorable reviews, it's ability to function wireless and wired, the fact it was over ear and it's moderate pricing. The headphones were being purchased to replace another Mpow model that ceased functioning correctly a few months after purchase before ultimately losing the ability to charge and had to be discarded. I thought perhaps since this 059 model was different and a newer version, it would not have the issues that the previously purchased model had. I was wrong. Within the first month, there was issues with crackling sounds when used wirelessly and sounds cutting out on 1 or both speakers sporadically. Since it was intermittent, it was more of an occasional annoyance in the beginning than anything else. Within 6 weeks of purchase though, the sound quality issues got worse and the ability to charge the headphones with the usb charger provided declined. It was only possible to use the headphones if they were plugged into a laptop with the provided cable. After another 10-14 days, they were not even able to function in that mode.  So within 2 months of purchasing, I was left with headphones that do not function in any capacity and followed along with the same breakdown of problems as the previous model I had purchased, only much quicker after purchase than the 5 months of use I got out of the other pair before their function decline began. I did decide to purchase the offered insurance for this pair after my experience with the previous pair. Unfortunately, due to how quickly after purchase I needed to make a claim, I was informed I needed to contact the manufacturer. I cannot even begin to figure out exactly whom I need contact to replace these considering all the numerous options there are when purchasing these through Amazon, especially taking into account that the manufacturer is based in Hong Kong when I looked up their info online to contact them. I recommend anyone that wants to purchase these, make sure you are aware of the possibility of equipment failure within 6 month's of purchase. And make sure you already know whom to contact and how to contact them when the inevitable occurs or just be fine with putting out $30-$60 for a short term use pair of headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The vendor asked me to review what I believe is the next step up, the H1. This is the review

The H1 is apparently a lighter weight version of the one I originally bought. I still have a problem with these blocking out any ambient sound. If my wife is watching TV, it is irritating to try to listen to streaming music or videos on my computer. She can't hear what I am playing, but I can hear the TV mixed with whatever I'm trying to lister to. The two media sounds clash and turning up the volume only blasts out and hurts my ears. There doesn't appear to be any difference between these two styles, other than the weight.

The sound and comfort are both good. If you are in a quiet room, with no other sounds nearby, they might work for you. If there are sounds from people or other electronics in the room, no matter how quiet, you will still hear it all. The bottom line is neither of these work well for blocking any sound at all. Spend the few extra dollars and get something with noise cancelling technology.

UPDATE: Although they state there is a 45 day money-back guarantee, they are charging a return fee! If you buy these and return return them you will get charged.

These appear to have a good quality sound. However, they block out nothing. I can hear everything in the room, with normal ambient sounds coming through. That's not what I want from headphones. I knew they were not noise cancelling when I bought them, but I did expect them to block some sound.

The company reached out to me promptly and sent me a replacement. This one works just fine and I've had no issues with it, and it's been several months since I have received this replacement. Changing one star review to four stars now.

Original 1 star review:

I originally really enjoyed these headphones. I loved that they were made of a (seemingly) sturdy material. I had no issues with sound quality or battery life. At the time, my only issue was that the headphones would blink, and I had no idea why. But it wasn't that much of a nuisance. However, today I look at my headphone and realize that the fabric on the band has nearly completely come off. I only use these headphones for casual listening, typically in my room, and don't use them every single day, so there's no reason for these to have lasted not even 3 months.

I bought a pair of 15$ bluetooth headphones that had 4.5+ star reviews; unfortunately, they are uncomfortable and sound bad to the point I wouldn't want to use them if they were free.  Too many people considered their dirt cheap price and inflated the review as a result, making it hard to discern quality difference between different priced headphones (considering prices are vastly different when people buy, using price as a main criteria for review is a bad way of reviewing because I have no way to know what you paid and the value you place on a dollar)

These get 3.5 stars based mostly on quality and not price (5 stars for value since they hit the minimum threshold of quality imo to be used daily).  I got these to be my backup headphones for work since I hate bringing my main pair back and forth.  Comparing these to the TaoTronics, they definitely dont have the same quality of sound, nor are the ear pads as soft and pillow like.  I do like the button setup on the right earpiece better though.  The charge time is only 20 hours vs 30 (advertised), but I never had run out of juice using either, so both are long enough for me.  The TaoTronics have a slightly less bulky profile and less ""creaky"" plastic as well.  At ~50$ the TaoTronics would be my purchase every time (I got these on sale for 26$) because even at ""double"" the price, it ends up being only 25 real dollars, which is a small amount considering the amount I listen to music and that they should last a few years.

In the end, these have solid comfort (true over the ear as stated), decent enough sound to not be noticeable in a bad way and link to my phone every time.  I even like how it tells you when you turn it on what phone its linked to (Phone 1 or Phone 2).

This is a true review on quality without considering price; 3.5 stars.

And I've had MANY pairs of different style headphones over the years.

I've used these every day for the last few months since I bought them and can genuine say that they work extremely well. The sound quality is very good, noise cancelling works very well as long as the volume is at the appropriate level and the battery on these lasts forever. The Bluetooth function is my favorite. I HATE cords.

My ONLY con with these headphones is that my set is starting to break where the headstrap meets the silver metal piece just above the headphones. On both sides too. Its a little upsetting just because of how much I love these headphones but on the other hand they were only $27. If these were $80 headphones I'd be pissed but considering how cheap they are I can forgive them for this one flaw.

The price was good and the fit was fine for me. Wearing comfort was OK but I haven't worn them for an extended period of time due to my issue with the audio quality (below).

Pairing was simple with  my smartphone. Operation with the buttons took a little getting used to but worked fine. I haven't used them enough to comment on battery life.

My major complaint with these headphones is the quality of the sound. The audio was just dull sounding to me. Mids and highs were poor and almost sounded muffled. Bass was only OK. I played the same music with a set of recently purchased MPow Bluetooth earbuds and there was no comparison. The earbuds audio was bright and realistic even though they cost about 1/2 the price of the over the ear headphones.

Edit 10/10/2017: My original review should have included the comment that for me the major complaint about the audio quality of these headphones is that vocals are coming through sounding muffled or dull and also seem to be at a lower level than the instrumentals on any track I listen to. Instrumental only tracks sound OK.

I unfortunately have just missed my 45 day money back return option so I'm stuck with them. I just know I would not purchase this item again or recommend them to others.

The wireless bluetooth operation, so far, has been error free. They quickly pair up with my Dell desktop, my iPhone and my iPad without any problem. But here are a few other observations: if your desktop computer does not have built in bluetooth, then you will have to purchase a separate ""dongle"" to make the connection. I didn't know this at the time I ordered the phones, so it took a couple more days to get the Plugable Technologies adaptor ($12.49). Also, there is no charger included with the phones. You will have to use the included USB connection cord that plugs into your desktop computer and the other end (which is tiny) plugs into the bottom of one of the ear phones. Charging via USB takes a couple of hours for a full charge, but the charge lasts for 20 hours or so. The only issue I have with the phones is that they are so tight against my head/ears that I can only wear them for  an hour before I have to take them off because my ears are killing me!

For my initial review, I've rated these headphones 2/5. But now I'm updating my review and rating to 4/5 and heres why. I was contacted by Patozon company and they were concerned about my issues and wanted to make it a better experience for me. They sent over the new headphone replacement without extra cost. They arrived quickly then anticipated. Right out the box the replacements looked a lot better then the first pair. The build quality was nice and the hinges seemed to be better then the first pair. As for the fit, I wear glasses all the time. But I was still able to get a nice seal around the ears and block the noises around me. As for the sound quality, they still struggle just a bit. But with my iPhone, I'm able to change the settings for the music and get something more desirable. Another great feature I like, is the battery status. on the iPhone, it displays how much charge is left on the headset. Not every headphones offer that feature. Overall this was a better headset then I thought. I also have to commend Patozon for their great customer service. They were patient and helpful and solved my issues swiftly.

Thank you,

Old review:
They are a mediocre pair of headphones. They do the simple job of playing music.  The build quality is rather decent. But just like every other headphones, the area that should concern is the hinges.

The sound range is much better than I would have expected, with clear peaks and a broad range for the bass drivers. I use these every week when editing videos for my YouTube channel, because they are better than several other Budget gaming headphones I've tried.

These are wireless headphones, which can be charged via USB, but you can also use them as wired headphones. So, if you dont want to use them wirelessly, there is no need to charge them. A single charge lasts for a good while. I've used them on long flights as well, and if I had to guess, on average, they last for about 8 hours of use before needing another charge.

There is no noise cancelling, but the pads on the ear cups are soft and mold well enough to the ears to dampen a good amount of external noise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Batterylife:
Holy smokes, this thing will go and go like your typical energizer bunny.

Comfort:
I've never found myself wanting to take these off simply because they hurt my ears or head. Very comfortable.

Sound Quality:
This is where you get what you pay for. They're your standard cheap can's sound quality. They don't touch Etymotic, Shure, or Klipsh, but they're not awful. I can admire music from nearly every speaker I hear it out of. The average person won't have an issue with the SQL.

Pairing Process:
I know this is important to a lot of you. The pairing process was very easy with my iPhone X, and my Macbook Pro 15"" (Late 2016). The caveat here, is how MPow allows two connected devices at the same time. There have been times I've turned these on 50 feet away from my computer, expecting them to pair to my phone, only to have forgotten they were last connected to my computer. Wouldn't you know, these headphones connected to the computer. They stuttered a bit (50 feet was also through concrete walls...), but the connectivity distance is surprising on these. Make sure you only keep one thing paired to them at a time though.

Durability:
I list durability because I work in the construction industry, so everything is subject to destruction. These headphones have held up to the tough environment I thrust them through.

Connectivity:
I already elaborated on the 50 feet range.

I got one day delivery - They were waiting when I got home tonight.  Quick set-up.  Had them connected to my phone in a minute.  Included in the packaging is a USB charging cable, a mini jack for corded connection to another device, a tiny little start-up guide and and nice little storage bag.  These headphones fold up for storage and claim a battery life of 20 hours.  They also have a built-in microphone for taking phone calls.  I haven’t tried the mic yet.

I’ll be keeping these.  I will keep the box and packaging until I can’t return them if there is a quality issue.

I listen to a lot of country, and I am really, really happy with the sound on the stuff I’ve listened to so far.  Mid range is a little scooped, but, oh well.....
I spent $30 for some great headphones for my intended use.
I have some more expensive headphones - they cost a lot more - but they’re not bluetooth, and I’m not taking them out side, which is where the MPOW’s I just got today will be.

I plan on using these while I’m out in the yard mowing.  Maybe for watching TV without waking her up....

Larson","Maybe can't use them in a quiet office - otherwise GREAT BUY!","February 25, 2018","I only have one negative thing to say about this product. They leak a lot of sound, so if you work in a quiet office and want to play music loudly through these headphones, other people will be able to hear it. This is not the case with more expensive (*much* more expensive) headphones.

The voice prompts that tell you what you're doing (""Power on"", ""Phone 1 connected"", ""Phone 2 connected"" etc.) are really nice, but can be different in the power-off sequence depending on which devices are connected. This is a *tad* confusing, and sometimes, depending on what devices are connected, the power-off sequence doesn't end with the typical, very useful ""Power Off"" voice output.

Other than that, these earn every bit of 5 stars for the price. As others say, the battery life is very good. It re-connects instantly with my phone and quickly after that with my laptop every time I turn the headphones on. Moving from wired headphones to these has been a really nice move. These have been totally worth the $35.

There are lots of thoughtful conveniences to these headphones: comes with a wire for wired listening; folding design; has its own volume switch, allowing you to bump up volumes when necessary; connects to multiple devices simultaneously.

The sound quality isn't incredible but it is good enough. I will say this: if the sound quality is bad enough on whatever device I'm listening, I do not enjoy listening to music. These are plenty good enough quality to be enjoyable (for me).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was on the lookout for a decent pair of wireless headphones for working out/running. These are AMAZING. Sound quality is surprisingly great for the price. They're better than most of my wired phones. I'm sure there are better options out there with a bigger price tag, but this is the best for what you're paying.

Design is sleek, durable, and a good weight (not cheap and light, but also not too heavy for comfort). Great fit, snug on the ears, definitely sound cancelling when audio is coming through. Little bulkier, but that's expected with this style. If you want slim, go with something else. But these are very comfortable.

Setup is VERY simple. One button to pair with phone, phone picked up the bluetooth signal within seconds.

Have NOT tested track skip options, or phone call navigation. I dont plan on using this to answer calls anyway. I'll update if I ever do.

PERFECT for what I needed: wireless, high quality sound for my activities.

I highly recommend giving these a shot, you will NOT be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They send new ones, but it was a different model (one that was cheaper than these). I tried them but they were too tight on the grip, had to take them out after several hours. I also wear glasses and it’s really uncomfortable with them on, but I need them to read. I’m not saying these headphones (mpow 059) are bad, but they don’t fit my needs which is active nose cancelling. Battery life is great, but padding started to crack in less than two years, so that’s a big con :(( Other than that they’re great for the price. Also, would’ve appreciated a sturdier packaging, the light bag that comes with these headphones broke easily.
*********************************************************

I study medicine and so noise cancelling and good audio are important for me. Description says it's noise cancelling passively, so feature is not really included. I read there is an upgrade to these head phones that does indeed do noise cancelling, so I would suggest getting those. I just put music or white noise to do the noise cancelling.

I would have to say I don't love that it only connects to 2 devices, would've wanted more. Battery life is good, lasts long time (and I study pretty much all day). Sound quality is alright, still think it could be louder and clearer when plugged in with the cable.

These cans certainly aren't doing anything to convince me otherwise. Passive noise isolation is almost nonexistent, like you'd expect from almost any very cheap cans; with the sound off, I can can run my fingernails lightly over the wall behind me and still hear it quite clearly. Total noise attenuation might be 4dB; possibly less.

The two high points so far are:
* Relatively lightweight
* Still comfortable after an hour

I'm worried about the folding mechanism; I'm not certain just how many times I can fold these before something snaps off. At least all(?) the moving parts appear to be some kind of light to medium steel, instead of more plastic.

I got these as very inexpensive, relatively acceptable headphones that wouldn't make me worry too much about theft or loss. I think they'll fill that niche, but that's as far as they go.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I bought these for myself to use with my Surface Pro 4 laptop-tablet combo. I use the headphones via blue tooth when my husband is watching something I don't want to watch on TV while sitting next to me. At times I'd rather put headphones on use my computer rather than watch tv, so the headphones allow me to do that without the sound from my computer interrupting my husbands TV show, or his TV show drowning out my computer. I'm very happy with these now I can listen to my computer in peace & the sound quality is decent. The red color matches my Surface Pro 4  red  detachable key board. The only 'con' for me is that the other included cable has a round shaped end & doesn't attach to any  external  ports on my Surface Pro 4. I believe that cable is more designed for use with a smart phone.  The cable is supposed to attach the headphones directly to your  device for when the batteries run out & blue tooth is not an option.

Good headphones!","February 28, 2018","Ordered these headphones just a few days ago, and came in a bit earlier than expected.

Based on what others have said (mostly the 3 star and below reviews), these were supposed to break within days/are supposed to be uncomfortable/have a bad mic/lousy sound, etc. I haven't experienced any of these issues.

Sure, they don't have a really deep bass, but the sound quality is pretty good. I don't hear any static or the like, it doesn't sound any different than my gaming USB headset; overall, I don't have any complaints whatsoever about the sound, other than the bass. That, however, was easily overlooked as everything else was fine.

I've also read of some battery life complaints. So far, I haven't had any issues with that either. I recharged the batteries the night my headphones came in and hadn't charged them since, using the bluetooth mode for over 7 hours. I'd say that's WAY more than decent. There's always the aux cord they came with if the batteries did die, which I was FULLY expecting to use 100% of the time, but I never needed to use the cord. Not yet anyway.

I haven't tested it with a phone call, but I did use them for a Discord chat when my mic broke. I was actually surprised to have a mic. According to my friends, they mic wasn't that great and the sound from the call was worse, so I CAN'T recommend these headphones for any phone calls. However, I DO use them for music on my phone, as I said via bluetooth, and it paired up just fine.

They definitely are the most comfortable pair I've had, next to my USB gaming headset, and they fit over my ears nicely. Kept my ears warm in cold weather too! I just don't know for sure if sound leaks out or not. I haven't had an opportunity where it would matter, but I would assume the sound doesn't leak out, provided you keep your headset AND your device at a decent volume (you read that right, the headphones keep their own volume as well. Pretty nifty!)

Some reviews say they stop working after a few days, up to maybe a few months. I've only had mine for a few days and they still seem to work as intended. Then again, I'm not too worried as long as I have the cord it came with. If anything, I would say just be careful with them like you would with a PS4, a TV, a computer, your phone, or the like. Don't misuse your equipment and it won't break right away. Not to say other customers are too rough, more-so just fold them carefully and whatnot.

So yeah, other than the lack of a real bass-feel with these headphones, I really like them and I'm glad I made the investment!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After over a week of around 1.5 hrs a day of gym/run time at near max volume, the headphones still hold a little over half of their charge. Pairing was a breeze, all buttons work just fine, and sound is pretty clear. Bass is great, treble is a little too sharp for rock/metal but that can be remedied through on a music player app. Will update in a couple months.

Update 1, a month later: I just experienced my first low battery beeps after over a month of the initial charge. I can’t really compare to higher end dre beats or bose, but the battery longevity for the price is outstanding.

Update 2, almost 2 years later (08/14/2019): this thing still goes strong after 1 charge and 6 days a week of usage at the gym (about 1-1.5hrs per day)! Amazing for travel.

If you have a smaller head you may want to keep looking.","January 11, 2018","Update: After my review the seller contacted me and offered to send me a replacement pair. They sent me the MPOW Flame headphones. After over six months of using the new headphones I cannot say enough good things about them and I am back to buy a second pair of Flame headphones for my husband. Great customer service!

I read a ton of reviews before buying this product and I was super excited to love them and use them daily. However, I ran into a bit of a snag...
First, all of the things I love about the Mpow 059:
 - They sync with my devices very quickly. (quicker than my $300 headphones)
 - I love that they talk to me and tell me what commands I have given. (e.g. Push the power button and it will tell you ""powering on"" or if your headphones are already on it says ""pairing"" ""phone one paired"")
 - I love that I can feel the volume  and track forward and back buttons easily
 - I love the ear padding, it feels good on your ears as opposed to the cheap snap-crackle-pop you get with some of the other ear covers out there.

Now for where things went wrong for me.
 - The reviews I read mentioned a long charging cord one even showed a 4 ft cord in the review video. My charging chord was a little over a foot and a half. Not a huge deal but certainly not helpful when I want to charge my headphones while wearing them in bed.
 - The biggest challenge with these headphones was size. I had the headphones set at the smallest setting and there was no tension to keep them on my ears so the band across the top of the earphones put a painful amount of pressure on the top of my head. I wore them for a couple of days, adjusting the band on top of my head forward or back to try and alleviate the pain but no luck.
I love so much about these headphones, I wish they worked for me but I just can't take head pain.

I hesitate sending them back, I'm not sure I want to deal with the hassle so I may just donate them to some lucky person (with a larger head).
Just be warned, if you have a smaller head you may want to keep looking.

Having said that, the sound on the Mpow 059 headphones are acceptable, but while they're fairly clear they don't offer an audiophile-level of sound reproduction. This, however, is really not the reason to own Bluetooth headphones. These connect easily to my Apple laptop at work, and, if I use the included software, they work well on my Windows 10 PC at home. Using Windows' default Bluetooth settings, I suffered audio quality loss and difficulty connecting and reconnecting.

I am extremely impressed with the quality of these headphones for the price. I was a little bit leery of going with an unknown brand of headphone, but I am pleasantly surprised.
I am in no way a headphone connoisseur, and keep in mind my ears are not as attune as others when it comes to quality, bass, treble, etc. but as for me, just wanting to listen to my music; they're perfect! Not sure how long the battery last yet as I'm still on my first charge, but I'm sure they'll last me the day at school and gym.
As for the comfort, it's probably as comfortable as you can expect headphones to be. They fit over my ears pretty well, and are adjustable depending on how large your head is. They also fold up and come with a aux cord in case the battery dies. Would purchase these a million times over, and would recommend to those who are looking for a good pair for a good price!

Pairing is quick and simple just press and hold the power button and you are good to go.

Sound quality will blow you away considering what you paid for these, I've bought many headphones in my life some very expensive and some very cheap, these sound like they should cost about $120 the bass isn't amazing but that'd alright with me.

Passive noise cancelation is nothing like active noise cancelation, all these do is isolate you from the outside world and as such anything too high pitched or too low pitched will still make it through. But once the music is playing you won't be able to hear the outside world at all.

Battery life has been outstanding so far as well I haven't actually managed to fully kill them yet but they did last from the moment I got through security st the airport to when I stepped into my ride at the other side a good 10 hours later.

My only real problem is the fact that instead of just a beep when at full volume it actually has a voice telling you that and it can be a bit annoying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I just got these today and I was testing them out in the various ranges and generas of music since I literally listen to everything from rock to pop to Latin (cumbia, banda,regatón, etc) to country to edm and many more. So I was trying it out on Bluetooth and at first it sounded a little low to me so I tried putting my phone volume as loud as I could and the sound was “okay” and I thought the bass was a little weak and the treble as passable. Then I started messing with the controls and that’s when I tried messing with the volume and suddenly the volume started to rise even though my phone volume was on “max”. In other words the volume on your phone is separate from the headphone!!! And it COMPLETELY changed the sound!!! For the price these headphones blow the same price range skullcandy’s out of the water!!!

I was pleasantly surprised to a) receive them and b) find out that this pair actually works. They asked me to update this review. I am doing it because there are reasons for it: a) I appreciate that they paid attention to my review and understood that the issue is not trivial, and b) because I am hoping to save others from having this issue in the future, and possibly, hope the company will include instructions of the sort that follow with the headphones.

How to keep the pairing: After the headphones are paired once, they should be able to keep their pairing with whatever device. The actual pairing 'code' is kept with the pairing device (phone, computer, TaoTronics transmitter), but the 'beaming' signal comes from the device to be paired (headphones). In my case, apparently one of the two headphone sets I had bought lost its ability to have its 'beaming' signal understood by the device I needed it paired with.

After trying various ways I found that it is important to turn the headphones on FIRST, *before* turning on the Bluetooth function or the device I want to pair the headphones with. After turning on the device or its Bluetooth function, I, then, lightly tap once the headphone's on/off button to 'jumpstart' their sending their signals to pair. Pairing with the device comes very soon after that.

To preserve the pairing 'code' in the device's memory and make sure I don't need to go through 'pairing' the next time I need, I reverse the order of turning things off. First I turn off the device (turn off the Bluetooth on the phone or computer or turn off the device) and after this is off, I press the headphones button long enough to turn them off to prolong the battery charge.

I use these headphones regularly with the TeoTronics Bluetooth Transmitter to connect two headphones to the same phone. The TaoTronic BT Transmitter is a goodie that adds Bluetooth functionality where absent (old cassette player, old LP player, etc) and allows you to pair to it two sets of headphones simultaneously. Both are important functions to me. I can listen to my old cassettes & LPs using the BT headphones, and two of us can watch the same show on TV/computer with headphones at the same time. This is invaluable for anyone hard of hearing.

Would I buy the headphones again? I already did. I liked their sound so much that I bought a second pair. So, yes, I do recommend them.

And, BTW, they worked very well on a plane. We connected two pairs to one phone (see method above) and played our music throughout the flight without interruptions when we needed to get up and walk! Perfect setup!
=================================
old(er) review:

I bought two of these pairs because they sound good. But they are a pain because they lose their pairing EVERY TIME. I sent a message to the company for another pair I bought and ended up returning after waiting for a response that was too late too little...

You have to keep pressing the button to turn them on or off. But while doing that they also go into pairing mode and ... forget to pair.

Otherwise... good headphones - satisfactory sound quality and excellent battery life. They were also fairly loose on my head, so I didn’t feel like I got headaches from wearing them. However, I had a lot of trouble getting the power/play/pause/call button to do exactly what I wanted. I probably just couldn’t figure out what area to press the button. And the case they come in isn’t hard, so I was always a little worried that I’d break them.

Customer service reached out to me, and I now have replacement headphones, Mpow H8 model, which are amazingly spectacular! The sound quality is excellent. They have active noise canceling (ANC), which is marvelous, and can be turned on/off. It does have an uncomfortable sound when you just have your headphones on with the ANC on, and no music. But, I imagine, if you buy these, it’s with the intention of listening to music/voices. The buttons are small enough to where you don’t have to hit a certain spot to play/pause. The ... ear covers (?) are more flexible than the Mpow 059, which makes it easier to have one ear uncovered (because sometimes that’s a necessary situation). The H8 fit a *little* more snug than the 059, which means I can push them back a little farther on my head, and not worry about them slipping off. Last, but not least, the Mpow H8 come with a hard case. I haven’t had them long enough to comment on the battery life, but I expect, with the 059 battery life being long, these may also perform at the same level.  https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless/dp/B076W29YZS/ref=mp_s_a_1_fkmrnull_8?keywords=mpow+h8&qid=1552138056&s=gateway&sr=8-8-fkmrnull","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They sound awesome and they're pretty good at blocking out background noise. The bluetooth connection has been a little iffy since I got them so I have just went to using the aux cable cord when this happens.  Used the bluetooth just fine for the last couple of days with no issues until I decided to charge it this morning since it was not connecting or reacting to pushing buttons.  The red light did not come on (will turn on when charging) and the side where you plug it in to charge got really hot.  Trying to find any kind of online support from MPOW is impossible and now my 'wireless' headphones are back to being plain old plug-in headphones.  They still sound awesome, but now I have to buy a longer aux cord so I can do work at my computer without having to sit so close to the screen.

Fit seems decent, but then again I've only had them on for 15 minutes so far.  Sound seems muffled, especially at low volume.  Keeping phone volume high and lowering volume on headphone seems a little better than the other way around.  Also seems better when I remind myself I only paid $34 for these, and my primary use will be for workouts at the gym or on my bike trainer.  If you're after good music quality, spend more $.  If your primary use will be listening to the music you love, spend a LOT more $$.  These will spend a lot of time banging around in my gym bag and just generally being abused.  For my intended use these should work well.

They read my review and sent me out a different pair of headphones, and the new ones are AMAZING! I am incredibly impressed that they went out of their way to make the customer happy.

Also, while I am still not a fan of this particular model, my boyfriend loves them. He says they are comfortable for him to wear and he really likes the bass. We will definitely be coming to this company and seller for any future headphone needs.
... End edit...

While the battery life is great, they seem to be made pretty well, and the Bluetooth range is good, they are way too tight! My ears were so sore after about 10 minutes!
And I know that one of the selling points great bass (which is why I chose these) but the rest of the audio sounds muffled, almost like I am listening through a tin can.
Not to mention that if the volume goes anywhere over half way, ALL the sound leaks out. No privacy here, I might as well be wearing a speaker attached to my head!

As such I wasn't about to spend a ton of money on headphones that I'm likely to beat to death with use. I relied on the Amazon customer reviews to find an inexpensive set of headphones with high ratings and lower price. I found the reviews for this model to be the most consistent so I took the chance and bought a set.

When they arrived I plugged them in to charge and was pleasantly surprised to see that they fully charged in about 4 hours. The next task was pairing the headphones with my cell phone. Typically this is the most frustrating part of blue-tooth technology but I was again pleasantly surprised that the pairing was simple and fast. Once paired I started testing the sound and volume and again, couldn't be happier. Sounds good and has enough bass to make rap sound good. Phone calls are surprisingly clear for both parties as well. I was concerned that the lack of microphone near my mouth would be an issue for the other party but no complaints so far. The headphones are very comfortable and the controls are easy to use. I like the ability to adjust volume, skip or go back to a song, and pause from the controls on the headphones. The cable to direct connect to an audio jack is great.

I'm definitely a little confused about these being a best seller because I'm assuming that most of the people who bought these couldn't care less about the people around them when they wear these. IE: You will be ""that"" person on a plane/bus/work who's music can be heard within a 5' radius to those around them. I wanted to keep these, but I'll be returning them because there's no way I can wear these at my office without driving my coworkers nuts. The overall look/design was fine (but I'm a 5'7 female with average sized ears and my ears barely fit). The sound quality was honestly average - even for the $30 price range though it could be better (but I didn't play with changing the equalizer on my phone - so it might have been better if I tried).

Update: Changed from 2 star to 4 star (the Mpow059 is still not a 4 star)- but customer service was really good and offered to send me the newest version of these headphones (Mpow H1 Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear Lightweight, Comfortable for Prolonged Wearing, Hi-Fi Stereo Wireless Headphones, Foldable Headset w/Built-in Mic and Wired Mode for PC/Cell Phones Black-Red). These are MUCH better than the Mpow 059 ones. The design is sleeker, and the volume doesn't pollute the way the Mpow059 ones do so I've actually been wearing these in my office. They still aren't completely sound pollution proof but I asked my coworker if she could hear my music when it was at just above mid-volume and she couldn't. The diameter is also slightly bigger so my average ears feel snug but not tight like the Mpow059. I would say if you're reading this, don't get the Mpow059 ones, and instead buy the newest model (Mpow H1), which is the same price. Also, the battery life is really good. I haven't charged this since I've got them last week. I've used them for at least 15-20 hours on throughout the week. In regards to phone calls, these aren't for you to be talking on the phone all day. People had a little trouble hearing me, but I was able to answer my call just fine.

However the buttons are terrible to deal with.  I can't believe none of the reviews seem to care about this.  The volume and navigation buttons are all on the same flat ring in a circle around the main button and everything is the same level with no tactile bumps or anything to help differentiate.  Also there is a medium press of the main button that activates pairing (with the unit already on) and a long press for powering down.  So every time you shut it off it goes into pairing mode (and announces it) for a second, then it shuts off as long as you keep pressing down.  Seems like that should be the opposite (most devices require a really long press for pairing).  Finally you might easily pinch your fingers in the area where the phones extend from the headband.

Yes, these could sound better, but not enough that would push me into paying another $100.  They sound awesome (way better bass than ANY in-ear version, IMHO) stay on great, are sweatproof (so far) and the luxury of having the cord saves you from low battery moments or when exercise equipment is wired for sound.

I didn’t leave them on for an extended period and I’d wear them for an hour or two and then take a rest from use for at least as long... and they still hurt and wearing them led to headaches. I’m petite but I don’t think that is a factor... I think the issue is in the plastic band that runs along the top of the head. The band is not flat but has an edge (like a C or L shape) and the comfort memory foam type cushion is located beneath that with the vinyl covering wrapping that edge so that edge coupled with the weight makes the cushion nonexistent. I had an indentation from that ridge on my scalp that took 2 days to go away and was headachy all the while. I tried wrapping extra cushion but then the cups were off. So while I can’t wear them as intended, moving around while working on projects, I have found them beneficial after pairing them with my tv which allows me to watch without worry of keeping others up... if I’m laying down so the weight isn’t pulling down on the top of my head, then they are perfectly comfortable. I should say I’ve never been a fan of headbands or sunglasses so I’m not accustomed to a band across my scalp so I might be more sensitive than others- I’m not sure, but these are not for you if band comfort is a concern. Totally happy with the electronic function and sound but these aren’t a fit for me due to comfort. I have the MPOW flame as well and those are great but i was looking to increase playing time and avoid the band under the chin or across the back of the neck, as that is a bit of a hassle if your working up a sweat and they will get pulled out of one ear when the band gets stuck. I have total confidence in the electronic and sound quality of this brand, which is telling because I’ve run through quite a few brands trying to find headphones with decent sound quality that hold up to high activity while wearing and these have been the only ones that have survived that test so now I just need to find the model that’s my comfort fit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Well Done.","January 10, 2018","For the money -- and even for MORE money -- these over the ear headphones are spectacular.

I am picky. But these are spectacular.  Why?

1.  They look more expensive than they are.  They are sturdy, stylish.

2.  They are very comfortable.  I have a big head. These fit just fine, and are VERY comfortable. These are perhaps the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned, and I have owned dozens of them over the years.  They do not grip your head too tight, nor are they too loose.  The padding on the earpeices is soft and plush, but not overdone or mushy.  These are great to wear.

3.  They sound really good.  Many Bluetooth headsets and earphone and heaphones at this price point have a whine or hum or static when no music is playing.  These do not -- they are absolutely silent.  The bass is deep and good.  They are pretty clear-sounding, not muddy.  Very very good sound.  You can pick out all of the crummy audio on YouTube, as compared to the cleaner audio from a service like Spotify or iTunes oor Amazon Music, which means that these can reproduce sound well enough for you to tell the difference.  I'd say that the headphones have a pretty neutral sound, with plenty of bass which does not overwhelm and is not too boomy, considering the price range.  You are never going to get 'best ever"" tight and accurate bass from bluetooth headphones in this price range, but the bass does not offend.  And as I said, I am rather picky, but I can apply a sliding scale based on price.  There are plenty of over-bassed, boomy headphones, and plenty of people who think that sounds good. Ugh.  With regular music, let's face it, you have Bluetooth compression, so it isn't ever going to be audiophile quality over Bluetooth.  But at home or going for a walk, I love these things.  They are so nice, I do not want to work out in them and ruin them or sweat them up. But I'll bet theyy'd be good for working out if you do not mind grody headphones. Lol.  They DO NOT feature active noise cancelling, but the ear cups block out most ambient noise.  Unless you are paying giant dollars, active noise cancellation merely kills battery life, adds noise and lower resolution sound.  Not necessary.  A doodad most do not need, and I do not miss it on these headphones.

4.  Mechanics:  They connected via Bluetooth very easily.  When you power them on, they connect relatively quickly. Walking all around  my entire 1200 sqft condo, I never lost the signal, even though the phone was on one side of the condo and I was on the other. They charge via the ubiquitous  micro-USB found on Android phones, though there is a warning not to charge these on anything more than a 5w adapter. The controls are sparse and subtle -- they are not visually obvious so as to ruin the aesthetics of the headphones -- but the controls are easy to find and use.  One power/pairing/play/pause button in the middle; up and down volume and forward and back buttons.  They work great. The charging port is subtly located, adding to the style and class of these very well-though-out headphones.

5.  Durability/longevity:  Hey I just bought them.  They seem to be of high quality but time will tell. I have 2 other MPOW products and have owned them for more than a year and they both still work fine, so MPOW seems to have their QC under control.

You see things like this at this price point and you think ""Are they worth it?"" and ""will it sound like garbage"".  Herere to tell you:  These are worth it, they sound great, and they are a very worthwhile purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Today a new pair of MPOW headphones arrived in the mail. I wasn't notified they were being sent, but I'm not complaining. Clearly MPOW saw my original review and wanted to remedy my concerns. While time will tell how good the replacement product (the MPOW H1 instead of what I originally had), I'm not increasing my rating, as I still believe the quality of the original product falls at about 3 stars despite the good customer experience.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I used these headphones for 11 months - nearly every business day.

Experience / Expectations:
 - First and foremost: there is no noise cancelling with these headphones, so if you're buying expecting that feature, you'll be disappointed.
 - The plastic creaks a lot when putting them on/taking them off. Not a real problem, just a little annoying.
 - The headphones are relatively comfortable to wear for 5-8 hours a day - I never felt as thought they were too tight, and the cheap padding design on the top did a good job.
 - In the first 6 months, the battery usually lasted 2.5 work days of use (20-22 hours) before needing to be recharged.
 - The sound is mediocre, but if you need to turn it up a lot for some reason, it has a relatively low ceiling to sound quality. Expect distortion at higher volumes.
 - The volume actually didn't go very loud when connected to my laptop via Bluetooth.
 - I used the headset microphone functionality regularly while working and didn't have too many complaints from co-workers working remotely. I suspect the mic picks up a lot of nearby noise in louder environments given the design (the mic is located on the earphone with the bluetooth controls).
 - The bluetooth connection failed periodically, but not consistently - I'm only pointing this out due to the minor annoyance, but don't have real complaints with this.
 - Sometimes even though the device was on and connected to my laptop, when switching from one application to another (ie: Google Play Music to WebEx), I had audio setup issues. I think this is simply due to Microsoft/Chrome/WebEx than the device.
 - I have a somewhat larger head, so when I put these on, I need to pull them out a bit - I believe the on-and-off 2-4x a day caused the plastic headstrap to fail (see ""Real Problems"").

Real Problems:
 - After 6 months of daily (business days) use, the battery needs recharging daily. Though I can't say I'm surprised given the price I paid for this device.
 - After 11 months, the plastic headstrap has cracked nearly all the way across. It's still usable for now, but will probably break completely in the next week or two.

Overall:
 - These are average headphones - when they drop in price to around $25, it's probably a reasonable buy.
 - Don't buy these if you're looking for superior sound.
 - Don't buy these if you're expecting long battery life after regular use - it would survive a day of travel if needed that long/frequently.
 - Buy these if you don't want to spend a lot on Bluetooth headphones - just don't expect them to last too long.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

If you’re getting these for the Bluetooth functionality specifically, look elsewhere as the Bluetooth function leaves much to be desired. I was lucky enough to get them paired and working with a usb dongle with my pc for about 5 minutes, upon restart of the computer they weren’t recognized again. Trying to use them connected to my iPhone and iPad were much easier, but the connection dropped frequently. I finally gave up after several hours of troubleshooting and researching and resolved to the 1/8 by 1/8 aux cord option.
If they last a couple months in this state; I’d say they were worth $40 (usb dongle not included...) also the driver the dongle came with was on a mini blue ray disk, and the instructions if you didn’t have access to a capable drive? Use a computer with a blueray disc reader and copy using a flash drive. Oh thanks guys, well thought out suggestion there, how about a download link?

Apparently terms like ""fantastic"", ""amazing"", and ""phenomenal"" are used loosely and to cover a wide range of very average products.  First off, FOR THE MONEY these are decent headphones.  They aren't anywhere close to better headphones in sound quality or build quality, but they aren't close to the price either.

My first and main issue with them is that there is noticeable lag between the show and the sound through these headphones.  Any lag in sound while watching a show makes them unusable in my opinion.  For music, not a big deal at all of course.

Second, the sound through these headphones is very average.  There is no deep bass; I've used much smaller headphones (not over ear, and not earbuds) that have MUCH better low range.  I have a pair of over ear headphones I purchased on Amazon for under $100 that have fantastic (truly fantastic, not fantastic for $35) sound, clarity, and low range.  There is some noticeable fuzz/static while listening to shows, though not enough that it really bothers me.

Let's stop giving 5 star, better than my Bose (not a fanboy), glowing reviews to average products.  It doesn't help anyone who needs honest opinions about products.

Lastly, mine only came with an audio cable and a USB cable; it did not include a power adapter, which it sounded like it should from the manual when it tells me to insert the charger into a standard outlet.

For $35, this is an OK set of headphones.  I wouldn't buy them again if the lag issue during shows is normal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

My explanation of why is below:

I am in Client Experience/Quality Assurance leadership and I review thousands of calls per month. Having a good quality set of headphones that doesn't cost $75+ that I can use both wired or wireless is essential to my job function. I have been through many pairs of headphones including ones that weighed 4+ pounds and gave me headaches after using them for 6+ hours a day.  I work in a very busy and loud place so in addition to sound quality, having an adequate noise cancelling feature is important to me.  These headphones have both!
One random and unexpected BIG PLUS to the headphones is (for me) unlike other ""high end"" headphone brands that I  have used previously these do not smash my stud earrings into my head/neck when I wear them for 6-10 hours per day!! I can even wear medium size hoop earrings and not have them smashed into me head/neck area.

Slick","Great headphones, just a little tight on my ears","June 27, 2017","Overall impression, these are great headphones for the price but, perhaps due to the size of my head, I can't wear them for long.  UPDATE:  After using these for over 2 years, they've definitely broken in and no longer stress my ears.  I can wear them for hours at a time without substantial discomfort.  Pay hundreds of dollars for something more comfortable or get these, your choice!

SOUND QUALITY: I'm really impressed with these headphones considering the price range they're in.  The sound is crystal clear and they're great at minimizing sound intrusion.  My neighbors were doing some serious construction the other day and I couldn't hear them with these headphones on.  These don't provide a massive bass experience but what you'll hear is the best I've experienced for headphones under $100

FIT:  For starters, I'm 6'2 and always have a hard time finding head-related gear (think sunglasses, hats) that fits properly.  I don't know why head stuff is so challenging for me.  Maybe I'm an alien, but these are too tight on my head right out of the box.  (2 years later, they feel pretty good!)  The padding, both on the ears and on the top of the head, is great but I can still only stand wearing them for 15-20 minutes at a time before my ears can't take the pressure anymore.

BATTERY LIFE:  When I initially reviewed this product, I was hesitant to mention anything about battery life since this seems to drastically decrease with age.  I've worn them almost daily since I bought them and am incredibly impressed with how long the battery lasts.  A single charge STILL gets me through several hours of listening.  I've never timed the duration but can vouch for a minimum of 5 hours of active listening time.

BONUS: I didn't realize from the picture but these fold down to a compact size really nicely.  They'll make for great travel headphones!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The red light came on and in a couple of minutes it went out. I thought maybe it had been charged and was still holding the charge. I was able to pair it with my iPad. I listened to two tunes and then a full half hour of a britcom on YouTube. Then the battery was done. I recharged it and had a similar experience. I just returned it for a refund. Be advised that you may or may not get one that works.

The company contacted me and said they would like to send me a replacement. I received the replacement and charged it. It took about 3.5 to 4 hours to charge. I then paired it with my iPad. I listened to some of my music about two CDs worth. I then watched about three of my favorite Britcoms on you tube. The audio quality was outstanding. I listened to music or watched you tube tv shows and some music tutorials for the next week and a half. I even had them on for 7.5 hours one day. I planned to wait until they needed charging before i wrote the review. They are still going strong. The fit is good and very comfortable. Now about the sound. I already said that it was outstanding.  I compared them to my Sennheiser cable head set. I honestly could not tell the difference. I then compared them to Bose wireless there was a very slight difference but not much. Overall they are extremely good. If you have trouble with them contact the company and see what they can do. I love them and could not be happier

*Sound cancellation is bad: even when adjusted and tightened enough, noise from the headphones is kind of loud. This could be bad on a phone call or even while playing music. This can be solved by lowering the volume to mid-low, but who does that?
*Media buttons: the buttons make a circle where Up/Down is for volume and Left/Right for Previous/Next Track. However, since they are not separated, you will press right-ish-down/up or up-left-ish often resulting on nothing or anything, but what you wanted to do.

I personally purchased these headphones to listen to books in my downtime and to listen to music while working out. For working out, I would not recommend. My head gets really sweaty during a workout and therefore that sweat transfers onto the pleather of the headphones and it's gross. I took the headphones off only after 15 minutes because I was afraid my sweat would ruin the speakers.  It is convenient that they fold and fit into the recommended carrying case but the folding mechanisms seem a little flimsy and I would not be surprised if they were to break.

The only time I have noticed it cutting out is when the microwave is turned on (which I haven’t figured out why yet) the battery lasts me about 3 days and I wear them almost all day whether I’m watching YouTube, playing games, or listening to my amazon playlists. I also ordered my husband a pair of these in black (I got the pink) and he loves them as well. He connects his to his phone and iPad as well. Oh and these come with a usb cord to charge them and also a dust bag/carrying bag thingy that is super convenient. So do I recommend these? Of course I do!

They sound slightly better than my $150 Beats. The build quality is okay, not the best but good enough for the $40 range. The ear cups are very comfortable and go around my ears. That's important because I have large ears, a big head, and wear eyeglasses so I often have issues with most over or on ear headphones. These are bulky as you might expect but not too large. They look even better in person than the photos. I got the green and black ones and the green is bright without looking like a kids toy. The weight is slightly more heavy than I'd want, but considering how well they fit and comfortable they are (I've worn then for hrs now) it's a fair trade off. Also they can be very loud. I usually have my volume at 75 or max but these are so good that I only need to put them at 50% and they are plenty loud. Can't hear my kids sitting next to me at all and they tell me I'm yelling! 😁 One con is that they do bleed noise if you have them at 50% or higher. Not an issue for the listener, but good to note in case you plan to use these in the bedroom or office. People around you can't really hear them if they're 40% or less though so it's no big deal for me. I started to buy on or over ear headphones after noticing hearing loss after years of earbuds so having a device that does not require me to put it above 50% volume is pretty great. I just hope they hold up to daily use and abuse on my commute. They do fold up to a nice small size and comes with a handy travel pouch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They paired to my PC, have decent sound, and feel comfortable on my head. However, the mic is absolutely useless. Any time you use the headphone mic for input, it automatically mutes the headphones.  Yes, the input and output functions of these headphones are mutually exclusive for no reason. You can't listen to anything if you plan on using the mic, unless you switch the output to the ""Hands-Free"" option in output, then you get the worst audio quality you can imagine (like streaming a 96kbps mp3 on a 20 year old phone that's dying). The ""Stereo"" output option only works when you have not selected the headphone mic as an input. This might be convenient if I, or anyone in the universe, used headphones exclusively to make phone calls. Forcing this and not allowing any customization to this feature by the consumer is absurd. I just want to actually be able to use my headphones while also using the built-in mic to chat. That should not be arbitrarily and secretly blocked by my hardware.

This pointless division of features completely ruins these headphones for even the simplest tasks. I do not recommend these to anyone who actually intends to use them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was worried they'd give out after a few months but they're going strong and I haven't had an issue.

Really soft ear padding that only has a little visual wear.

The material is plastic and does come off a little like a toy, but it doesn't feel weak and mine hasn't scratched or snapped anywhere.

The button for skipping/pausing/volume works intuitively.

The noise cancelling is good but not great.

The bluetooth can be spotty when you're outside, or when you're at home and get farther than 20 feet from the device. It connects easily to everything but my computer which is probably my failure more than its. You can have multiple things connected with it via bluetooth at the same time however swapping between them is hit and miss.

Includes a double-ended connector cord for when the battery is dead or you want to plug it into something for reasons.

Comes with a soft velour-feeling bag for carrying that I never use.

They fold up and are stretched/shrunk simply and without any issue.

The battery life lasts me days without a recharge. The recharge is 4 or so hours. The charger plug-in port is mini-usb, the kind used with the PS4 controller cords opposite the usb end. I haven't actually opened the bag with my charger because I just use the one for my android phone.

The inside of band that presses against the top of your head is soft, but can still make the spot sore if you can't find a good fit, which I do have a problem with now and then despite being it adjustable. Only maybe one day a month and I couldn't tell you why.

The sound quality is good and the volume is separate from the volume of the device it's connected with so you can mess around with both to find your ideal volume.

The mike isn't great for calls compared to some other 20$ or so over ear headphones I've had. There's an issue with my voice not being picked up so I'll talk louder than I'm used to (though I'm a quiet speaker) or adjust the side with the mike a bit. It works but I usually ask if they can hear me first because I don't trust it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

You can use them over bluetooth (or 3.5mm) while plugged in to charge, although there's an audible electrical hum from the charger. No need to turn them on/use battery if you plug in 3.5mm.

The downside is that sound quality is incredibly poor. (I.e. iPhone earbuds and Panasonic ergofits provide much clearer sound, at the same price or less.) The mids are present, but treble and bass are seriously lacking. Sound is very muffled. I'm honestly not sure if the set I received was defective, or if these are just cheaply made. I'm returning them.

Update: Mpow sent me an H2 set to try. These were better, but not great. I ended up purchasing Sony MDR-XB50AP earbuds, which sound much fuller for a few dollars less.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Can't turn off the unit using the buttons on the headphone!","February 19, 2019","I have now used this headphone for awhile now so I could give an accurate review. I have two devices paired to this headphone, a Galaxy Tab A tablet as the 1st device and a Motorola Moto Z2 Force phone as the 2nd device. Both are running Oreo version 8.

The first surprise was that this headphone can be connected to two devices at once! However, linking to the 2nd device paired first does not let the first device paired connect. When the first paired device is already connected, the headphone will allow connection of the second device. In my case, if a call comes in while streaming from the tablet, it will switch to the phone and allow me to answer and allow me to control it and then returns to the tablet once completed. Very nice!

Audio quality is okay, there is bass but not the deep base much below 70 Hz that I've gotten on other headphones connected to my tablet which is my main streaming device. There appears to be a distinct peak about 100-200 Hz also. The highs are very sharp and brilliant, I like this a lot! The over-the-ear design is super comfortable and there is not an alignment issue as with some on-ear headphones I've encountered. Besides in cold weather they keep your ears nice and warm. I can wear these all day long with no discomfort at all! When riding a bike, I have not encountered a severe wind noise problem like I have with other headphones and if you keep the volume reasonable you can hear things around you adequately. That's kind of important on a bike on busy streets! Overall I would say that sound quality and construction are quite good for the price of this headphone. Also, the battery life is really good, it runs almost two days of 8-hour running before needing charging!

The reason I knocked one star off on my general assesment is that you can't turn the headset OFF! Pushing and holding the center button only gets you to ""pairing mode"" not off...strange! To turn it off you have to plug in the charging cable with power from the dongle, just plugging that cable in does nothing! I have never quite experienced anything like this before and it's kind of puzzling! I find the controls hard to find when the headphone is on your head too! They are located on the right earpiece in a ring around the center play/pause button. They do allow you to adjust up/down volume and to go forward/backwards in tracks on separate controls. They make a distinct click when pushed...very nice! The instructions provided are not great and the type is awfully small to read. Not well done!

Overall, a good Bluetooth headphone for the price, although it would be nice to be able to power off the headphone with the center button. I'll just have to get used to that I guess!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

My only complaints are the beeping when the battery is about to die. It's obnoxious. Trust me, you will see what I mean. I would MUCH rather have it just turn off than the constant beeping.

These are great and would last forever if not for the ear padding. This is the only reason why I have to get a new pair every 5 months. The padding starts deteriorating which leaves little black specks on your ears and skin. It usually brushes right off, but it's embarrassing if you don't notice it right away and are walking around with black crap and dust all over the side of your face.

Besides these two issues, these are great and decent quality headphones.

My first headset from them was just tiny wireless Bluetooth earbuds and I love them. I bought them about 2 years ago and they are still going strong and the battery still lasts forever which is incredible. Since I needed a new headset for my computer instead of my phone yet again I decided instead of the usual which is usually Turtle Beach and lasts about a year I would check out Mpow's offering.

This is the headset I decided to get and I'm not disappointed with my first impressions. Comfortable, acceptable sound quality and they feel sturdy. They can be wired or wireless which is a huge plus for me since 50% of the time the wire breaking down on Turtle Beach is the problem and then the other is Turtle Beach just falls apart because it's cheap plastic. This has METAL in obvious strategic locations so I have a good feeling these are going to last awhile hopefully and if they break, metal is much easier to fix than cheap plastic. Overall perfect fit and I have a relatively big head so size matters here. I think they hit the perfect dimensions to accommodate our different sized cue balls so if Mpow keeps up the great work I doubt I'll buy anything other than Mpow for as long as they keep pushing out great headphones.

Cons - a very slightly heavy but you don't notice it after you put them on and think awwwwww yyeeeeaaaahhh thems some comfortable ear cups. Honestly, it's not a big deal and just now I took them off and gave them a few bounces in my hand and they didn't seem heavy but my initial impression was they were a bit weighty so I'm sticking in on here anyway. Sound quality could be better but honestly, they sound epic enough to satisfy me so could be improved but overall what a fantastic headset! Great job Mpow love the name love their headsets more!

On a side note if you get these head over to youtube a google ""Falcon Heavy Sounds"" you won't be disappointed! *if you like rockets, sonic booms, and Tesla Roadsters in space.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was so impressed by the sound that I bought a pair for my PC and bought 2 pair of MPOW earbuds for Christmas presents this past December. (both recipients loved the earbuds). My only ""caution"" is this, after 16 months of use (heavy use, at least 2 hours a day, sometimes more, inside outside, cold weather or hot weather) the protein covering of the underside of the headband is coming off. They still sound amazing, there are no cracks, no scuffs, no chips, just that protein covering over the foam. For $35, I'm not mad about that. I am getting ready to buy another pair.

It is very comfortable and I have been able to wear these for well over 8 hours. I would have given this a 5 star but the fabric on the headband (upper area) is already ripping off exposing the foam underneath which was disappointing to say the least as I wear this at a desk all day with no quick or fast movements and it gets charged on my desk (I don't even fold them up when not in use). The controls on the headset itself should have more of a accented button for each, possibly a indent on the four outer buttons on the wheel?

I would recommend these IF they can fix the very short lived fabric ripping off issue, it appears they used cheap glue that came right out after only 2 weeks of use.

Pros
* Can be used as wired or wireless
* Battery is long lasting
* Comfortable for long periods of time
* Can be folded to become more compact for travel
* Can handle 2 bluetooth connections

Cons
* Cheap construction involving the fabric
* Leaks audio even while being a well sealed closed back design
* Buttons on headset not built with tactile feedback to determine button placement (I know they are easy to understand just a small point for future revisions)
* Takes too long to power off, have to hold the button for a while. I would suggest a button combination for quick powering off like volume down and volume up at the same time.

While the audio still works great, the structure of the headphones started to break down after 6 months of regular use on the headband, requiring multiple repairs to keep the padding and leather in the band in place. After a year of regular use, the imitation leather ear cups are breaking down and flaking off—and mpow doesn’t sell replacement ear cups.

Hopefully the two year warranty will cover this, but it would be nice if the structure held up for more than a year of regular use.

Both of those are usually more expensive, so that's fine.

The actual physical build of the thing feels nice and sturdy while being soft in the right places, but did hurt to wear for extended use. The mic worked well. But a pile of annoyances and a disappointing battery life led me to give up on these after a few months.

Annoying blue LED blinks constantly while in use, making it a poor choice for nighttime and places you don't want to disturb others. Audio prompts blare at max volume for many of its functions and warnings.

It took me a while to get used to its on/off functionality, as it takes 5 seconds of holding the button down to do so, according to the manual. In practice it was even longer than that. That's a ridiculous amount of time to waste holding down a crummy garage-door-button-quality switch.

I eventually got to the point where I could get the thing to turn off reliably, but its battery life was still much shorter than I was hoping for. In practice I was getting maybe 5 hours on average. Perhaps it would be closer to the advertised battery life if I used it continuously after unplugging it rather than using it in a stop and go fashion.

But it turns out I don't want to leave this thing and its blinking LEDs plugged in all the time, and I expect it to hold its charge if I leave it on the shelf for a day.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Big issue comes with the Bluetooth though. In a few occasions the headphones would be glitchy and disconnect or the audio would be all fuzzy. You can easily fix it by re-pairing the headphones but it's still pretty annoying. Perhaps the biggest issue I ran into was charging the headphones. The first two months were great and the headphones charged very fast and the battery life was excellent. Then one night they would no longer charge. The red light that indicates if the headphones are charging didn't turn on either. I tried using multiple USBs but none of them worked.

Eventually I called customer support, they offered 15$ to help pay for a new charger.

As far as looks go they are very aesthetically pleasing, they look nothing like you paid $34.99  that's great. The booklet stated that they needed to be charged for 4 hours before the first listen, it wasn't very long after I had them hooked up, maybe 2 hours if not that long the charging led shut off. It certainly wasn't the full 4 hours, I thought that was pretty odd but didn't put too much into it, the important thing was the sound.Another little cool feature is these headphones have voice commands never seen that on a pair before, now onto the sound. Putting it simple the sound is garbage, the bass if you can consider it as such is so muddy and muffled it almost sounds like the music is coming out of a hole,  I had to turn my volume up to max and even then the sound was still horrendous. Now after all that I have to really wonder about all these beaming reviews, how many are authentic and how many are fabricated, that seems to be an ongoing issue on Amazon, I have learned if you want a truthful review on a product or an unbiased one that points out the bad as well as the good, look up 4 star and below ratings. If I had done so in the beginning I would have had more insight on the performance and been able to make a better thoughtfull purchase. The only pros to these are the look/design and voice command features, quite a few people were upset over the fact they don't seem to last long and have issues with connection, the fact that they seem not to come to a full
 4 hour charge could have meant trouble down the road as well. In this case you definitely get what you pay for.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I checked to see if maybe charging would help, but after charging fully, the quality is still painful. The quality doesn't suffer when using the adapter cord, though, so no idea what is happening there. But since I purchased these with the main intent of online communication for my school work, and the microphone only works in Bluetooth mode, these aren't working as intended.

A huge disappointment, since they started off so phenomenally!

Note: I just got these in the mail, so I've only used these as wired headphones.

Right off the bat, I LOVE these! To do a test on how well they are, I put on the soundtrack for The Greatest Showman. Anyone who has listened to it knows that there are some huge imbalances in the audio on a few tracks. But with these headphones? NO!!! I don't need to be changing the volume to hear everything without rupturing my eardrums on the louder parts of the songs!! YESSS!!!! I'm honestly astonished at how well balanced the audio is. I hope the wireless capabilities are just as wonderful!

These are definitely over the ear headphones for me, and feel very comfortable on my head and ears, even with small hoop earrings in. These definitely give a great first impression, even though they don't come with their own charging base.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Just bought a second pair for my Mommy and she enjoys them as well. They no longer feel heavy, I was just used to the light comfort of Beats. These do loosen over time, they are a bit wobbly now but still seem structurally fine.

+
Nice volume
Mostly comfy fit and I've slept in them
Easy, functional controls
Good range with very minimal cutting in and out
Easy to pair
Pairs with my TV (with a Bluetooth transmitter) and phone at the same time (whichever pairs first is what you'll hear)
Big head friendly...mostly
There's a voice vs just beeps to tell me it's pairing, powering off etc
Does block out a lot of sound...in my home with noisy neighbors and  when I have the volume up, I do not hear them at all
Decent bass and clarity though nothing special
Pretty good battery life, very good actually
Ear fits comfortably inside the cups, I have small/medium sized ears
Ears do not get sore after long term use
The overall sound quality is pretty good

-
The sound leaks horribly even at lower levels so I cannot with a clear conscience wear these on the bus to block out the loud people I'd become if I used them
I have a big head and fear they will break if pulled too far/much
Sometimes when I'm eating, the headphones sit on my jawline making it uncomfy to open my mouth
Can be a tad uncomfortable and quite heavy on the head but I adjust
When I'm listening to classical music there's too much treble and bass making it screech even at level 1
The Bluetooth works okay sometimes but you have to talk loudly to be heard
Even though it humors me, these get wonky near the microwave and if the microwave is on and I'm within ten feet, it'll cut out

I like these and would buy again if the ones I have last a long time. We know it's becoming difficult to trust reviews of those that receive free/discounted items. I did not. Purchased these at full price in hopes it was not a regretful purchase. I haven't any regrets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They are the first such headphones I have purchased.  I have been really surprised by the battery life, considering I will use them for 3-4 hours at a time 2-3 times without charging them.  I've never had the battery go dead or even warn me to recharge.  What's that?  12 hours of battery life?  Give or take an hour.

There are times the sound quality is a little too good?  If I'm in my house alone and listening to them, I find myself turning around wondering what it was I heard, only to realize it's a piece of a song or part of a show I had not been able to hear before.  Kind of scary, but also funny.

The only reason I put them at 4 stars instead of 5 is that the material quality doesn't feel incredible? They don't feel cheap, per se, but they do feel lighter and slightly floppier than one might anticipate. Also, after an hour or two of wear, the top of my head does hurt a little bit. Adjusting the size of the band only makes them fall down one's ears.

On the whole, though, I love them- they are easy to sync, easy to turn on and off, have good sound quality, and I really like the color.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Cons: People with alot of hair may find the headband slightly tight on their head.

Overall: I've had these headphones for about a week now and I've been running them for short and extended periods of time to test battery life, function of the mic as well as overall sound quality. For $39.99 I can't even lie.... I thought it was too good to be true. The build quality is amazing for $40. As an audio engineer, I'm really big on quality over volume. These offer pretty solid quality and the volume is almost too loud. Which is a great thing because I won't have to crank the volume up much. The mic works perfectly fine. The battery has been solid through 8 and 9 Hours of constant listening and talking. I haven't tested how long I can keep these going before they cut off but 10 to 15 hours Hours I think is the estimate... I think it might be up to 20 Hours. The build quality is better than the first batch of Beats By Dre's. Don't argue with me. I've owned them and the headband on the Studio and Solo (1st Generation) were freaking HORRIBLE and fragile.
Buy them. Don't think about it. Just spend your money.

They're a good value for watching TV or listening to music without cables. Not the best performance, but they're super low cost. If you have pets that like to chew cables, these are great because they have no exposed  wires. I have 3 MPOW headsets (2x of these and 1 earbud set) and am pretty happy with them all.

Pros:
- cheap
- decent build quality
- backup 1/8"" stereo plug
- comfortable enough to wear for several hours at a time
- does not pair as a phone headset with OSX, so the audio connection is higher quality

Cons:
- acceptable sound quality

The sound is superior considering the cost and while some are comparing them to 99.99+ Bose headphones there's NO WAY these sound (believe me, I've extensively compared them and have no idea how they reached this conclusion), but they do sound great. After a few hours they kinda hurt my top of head so I literally put a folded washrag underneath them to pad the top a little more but it's not bad but much more comfortable after a few hours these WILL kinda hurt the top of your head. Some softer foam inside the top would be a much better design..... The padding in the top isn't superior but pretty good but you'll want to do the same probably or remove them for 10 mins every hour or two maybe. The ear cans sound great and while they don't cancel out noise near as well like many Bose and higher end phones they are definitely DAMN close . One thing I recommend because these are built exactly like my Samsung ones as far as how the fold and even have the same exact style hinges is to NOT fold them up fast or hard. Be gentle and fold them slowly. I wasn't careful too much with my Samsung Phones with the exact same style of folding mechanism they cracked at the screw points at the hinges and I had to super glue them just right to fix them but to also have them foldable too. They DO support two (maybe more) Bluetooth gadgets paired and you hold the button in until silent and then press it again to toggle between the audio but it's kinda finicky and doesn't always switch back and forth very well...I have to often turn off my phones to pair them to my Fire Stick again where's my other BT headphones can pair to up to 5 devices so that'd be my only complaint and isn't even really that big of deal, it'd just be convenient is all if it were a bit smoother to switch between different devices paired to them....Overall I give them and easy 5 stars and will prob buy a newer style once they release a hopefully better update to them, but again, for the money I was pretty amazed at the sound and build quality..... Definitely worth buying if you like over the ear headphones for home etc. You wouldn't want these for jogging etc, they're a bit big for that and would fall off easily...you need some in ear style phones for anything rigorous. But for home and maybe just mowing the lawn etc, these are GREAT!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They fit on the head firmly, and depending on how big your ears are they are comfortable for long periods of time. The headphones connect with your phone/tablet quickly, and I can pass from one room to the next without losing the connection. On the side of the ear pieces, there are very simple controls that make it super easy to skip songs, pause, or raise the volume. So, for the price? Great purchase. However, there are a few problems that may be dealbreakers for some.

First of all, if you’re a wireless headphone aficionado, then this is not for you. The quality of these headphones have nothing on the higher priced options out there. Second, the sound is not very good. Music comes out somewhat flat and the bass is no bueno. If you’re looking for choice dub and drops, you’re not going to find it here. Lastly, the cord it comes with (should you choose not to go wireless) crapped out in about a month with very limited use. I was disappointed with that, for sure. Otherwise this is a great pair of headphones for the casual listener and newbies in regards to wireless. I don’t regret this purchase at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The seller has finally contacted me and was wonderful in wanting to help me out in getting a new pair. However I did return them and didn't need a new pair. But Bella was very nice and took the time to make sure I was taken care of. Took longer then I would have liked to get this problem fixed but better late then never I always say. :)

I am now giving this review one star, just for the simple fact that the seller didn't want to help me at all. If I could give it ZERO I would. After 4 failed attempts to contact the seller, I just returned them. You are way better off buying something else. I bought a new headset that's way better and was way cheaper as well. Expensive doesn't always mean better!

When I received this headset, it connected no problem to my PS4 Slim. I guess it doesn't have wireless capabilities so I had to have them plugged into my controller. which wasn't a problem for me, just unexpected. They are very comfortable to wear and the charge lasted about 5-6 hours before I started to hear them cut in and out knowing I needed to charge them. I can not tell you how all the buttons work for I got a faulty headset. That's why I gave them 2 stars. I contacted the seller 3 times before just returning the headset and buying a different pair.

Maybe three. I have to share mine with my wife. These are awesome! I bought these and a pair of MPOW Thor. These are much better. I wear them at work in my office job to drown out the distractions, as well as my side job--my lawn care business. They work very well to block out the loud engine noise and create a wonderful listening experience. I often listen to audiobook which are very easy to hear in a loud environment. These headphones have a rich and deep sound for music. As good as Beats, to me. A very long battery cycle is nice. I charge mine maybe once a week if even that. And that's listening for a couple hours at work, then 2-4 in the evenings. They adjust well and fit nicely. They don't feel cheap. To be honest the Thor model feels cheap and doesn't compare. On these, the controls are very nice and easy to use. The range is astonishing. I walk to the printer and forget to take my phone. No loss at all with many people and computers/smartphones/devices between. Mowing, I've left my phone on the mower and walked all the way around the house without loss or even a skip.

Sorry for the length, but I want to make sure I cover it all. I have not a single complaint in several months of hard use. Buy them. Buy these over the Thor. Sorry MPOW to bash the Thor but these are far superior. Ordering a few more pairs soon. One to keep at work so I don't have to carry in and out. One for wife, one for uncle.

The buttons on the side smooth. It is hard to tell what button you are pushing. Maybe if they has something that you could feel that tells you what button you are on right away.
the indicator for what side in Left or Right is very hard to see. That's not a deal breaker by any means. Just something I noticed.
Now on to the rest.
Noise cancelling, for my needs they are perfect. I can hear if someone starts talking to me but I can't hear all the stupid back ground chatter. If I needed to block out as much as possible … not so good.
Feel, I was worried they would feel cheap. While these do not feel like $400 Bose headphones they don't feel cheap either.
Bass Quality, Not so good here. I have had better. Not that I need more than what it offers.
Sound Quality, This is one that kinda took me a while to decide on. I kept hearing little noises. Things I hadn't heard before. After paying attention to them I realized I was hearing sounds from what I was listening to better than my last pair. Now that I know they are there I would miss them if I used a different pair.
The biggest reason I'm giving this full stars is the Bluetooth. They connect as fast as airpods connecting to an iPad. The might even be faster! They hardly are on when it's telling me they are connected. I hate struggling to connect. Not only do they connect fast but they stay connected.

If you're having issues with audio cutting out, make sure you don't have any other Bluetooth devices connected with the device you're listening to. Also the microphone isn't really something you can use it for, at least on Windows. But all in all they're really good for the price point, and they work and sound good almost all the time.

I have nightmares about getting my old bluetooth cell phone to pair with the audio in my 07 Camry, but these paired up to my iPhone 7+ immediately.  I also purchased the DayKit Mini USB Bluetooth CSR 4.0 Dual Mode (a steal at under 7 bucks) and the Mpow headphones paired up with my PC instantly.  The sound quality is decent although it won't blow you away with extremes of volume or bass.  For average listening though, they are more than adequate and they are wicked comfortable to wear.  Take them off every hour or so, so your ears can breathe though. .  The ONLY issue I've had, and it's not the fault of the Mpow people is that when I run iTunes on my  Win10 PC it gets way confused and I have to turn Bluetooth off, exit iTunes, then turn Bluetooth back on and restart iTunes.  Since I have other networked devices in the house, iTunes sees them on the network, but it doesn't show them as an option.  I have to select the ""My  Computer"" to get it to work.

The headset will connect, but will refuse to be configured. as soon as the windows 7/10 audio management interface opens, the headset remains connected, but loses all audio and feedback. the only solution to this is to turn the headset off and back on again. I can't even adjust the headset's volume due to this predicament. The headset works fine when plugged in with a 3.5mm cable, but that's not what i bought it for.

It has to do with the firmware that is applied to this brand of headphones. it's usually applied to lower end bluetooth headsets and is meant for use on your phone. In short, if you want a headset for your PC move on.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I ordered these last week alongwith a Bluetooth dongle for my desktop. Getting the mic to work on applications like Discord, Skype etc has been a pain. Ultimately figured out I had to have the headphones paired (and turned ON) before the desktop booted. For some reason, the mic doesn't work and picks up garbled junk if I pair it later on.

Even for the ""value"" of these headphones, the sound really isnt great. It's ok at best. I got the black ones so they were more expensive and for about $50 (with shipping), I could have gotten some on ear headphones that sound better. My free headphones that came with my phone have better sound quality. The sound from these headphones also leaks out really bad, so when you decide to turn up the volume more than 50% not only will you be jamming out, but so will everyone else around you. I'm not sure if those that say these have good bass have actually heard a sound system before. The bass out of these sound like a 10 dollar swap meet subwoofer trying too hard. Not muffled or blown, just a little punch and no actual deep tone bass. Granted these aren't $300 headphones like other popular brands, so ""great bass"" isnt to be expected, but I've had headphones around the same price and sounded much better.

Works great with two devices and is secure. Here's how I accidentally found out that it was really secure for Bluetooth:

Dual booted into a separate OS. Headphones won't connect to same Bluetooth mac on different OS. This means it won't allow connection if it's from a different device with the same mac preventing man in the middle attacks.

Device powers down if not connected for a period of time which is a bonus.

20+ hours battery life is probably an understatement if you use them like a normal person.

I only charge mine every few days and I use them all the time. I charge my phone 3 times more often and use it half as often.

They are way more comfortable than many more expensive headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

There is no workaround for the tightness; if you're prone to headaches or migraines or allergies, truly consider whether or nor you'd like a product like this. While it may seem like the tight feel might not affect these factors, what you end up feeling like is some kind of pressure on your temples/sides/ears, which can aggregate your medical symptoms, if you have any (Aforementioned).

Headphones are noise isolating and not cancelling, but the product box says they're noise-cancelling. Watch out for this. The compactness of it when folded is really nice. The travel bag is handy as well. The plastic is noisy and the buttons clunky, so expect some squeaking of some sort. Battery is fairly good; if you use earphones a lot, you might find using the cable for it for practical. For my uses of daily youtube searching, a full charge lasts about three days. Cable length for corded use is pretty good. Obvi, range for BT is much better when you choose to use it.

While the product is good, and is pretty good as a basic quality pair of headphones, I wouldn't recommend this product.

I have several Bluetooth speakers, but I bought these ones specifically because I wanted to listen to music while wearing winter hats/earmuffs in my cold region. In that respect these are perfect! You can still hear very well even through several layers of winter coverings.
Overall the construction of these headphones is great. The components feel solid, the cups are soft and large, and the headphones fit well. The battery lasts, probably at least 10 hours (although I’ve never timed it, it’s a really decent amount of time).
The only issue are the controls and the interface, they are really disappointing. As you can see from the pictures, the volume, play/pause, forward and backward buttons are all on one side of one earbud. In general they easy to figure out, the center button is pause/play, up and down are for volume, left and right are for forward and back. The issues is there is no really hard delineation between where “up and down” and “left and right” start and end, so sometimes when I try to turn the volume up, it fast forwards instead or vice versa. And that’s with my bare hands. If I add gloves that I might as well forget it. The buttons are not raised up from the surface at all so you can’t tell where one button ends or begins. The other thing that drives me totally nuts is the power button. You must press and hold the play button for probably 3 seconds in order for it to say “powering on” and hold it for another second for it to say “your headset is connected” (to Bluetooth). The same for powering off. If you press and hold for the first 3 seconds but not longer, you can disconnect the Bluetooth, but then the headphones won’t be powered off. If you press for too long, it starts to cycle where it will turn it on then turn it off again. You really need to press it for the exactly correct amount of time if you want to turn it on and off correctly. This is such a huge pain when all I want to do is turn it on or off! Please for the love of everything, make the power button its own button and make the internal software not suck so badly!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have small ears, so they fit very well when adjusted properly. I can wear them for hours with no problems. I like the fact that I can bend over or look down without them falling off.
I've used them with my Galaxy S9 and my Gear VR, and it sounds very good. I can connect it to my computer and phone at the same time. I've also had it connected to my Galaxy S5 and S9 at the same time.

It does seem quite sturdy. It's lightweight and has good padding for the top of your head. They told up nice so they fit in the nice drawstring pouch that came with it.
One more thing I like, is you can plug then in too with the enclosed wire. (Even though many phone's 3.5 mm ports are disappearing) They have nice sound for the price.

Things that could be better. The buttons. They are almost flat. It makes it a bit difficult to feel where the center becomes the up, down, left and right.
The voice prompt seems louder than what the volume is set. Also, whenever I start a video or press to go to the next video, it says ""Mute"". But it doesn't mute.

Oliver","Close, but not for me","May 3, 2017","I am unfairly comparing these to a much more expensive pair of Bose QC15 headphones which I love, but these Mpows fall short for me in a couple of areas.

First off, they are bulkier and heavier than I would like. I have worn my Bose headphones for hours at a time with no problems. But the weight of these and the fact that they clamp a bit tight to my head means that after 30 mins I need to shift them around or take a break. Second, the folding mechanism isn't that helpful. They are still boxy and take up a lot of space in my bag. The way that Bose pivots the ear cups to create more of a flat plane is a better solution for transport in a messenger bag / laptop bag.

On the plus side, Mpow bluetooth connectivity is great in my experience. Both these and a separate in-ear set that I have connect quickly and rarely give me issues, and I love the audible notification for power/connect status. Also no complaints about the sound -- volume and clarity are great.

I looked at Bose Soundlink II, Beats Studio Wireless, SkullCandy Crusher Wireless, Sony Xtra Bass wireless, and more. I finally decided to get these, after realizing that $200+ was just too much for headphones. I have yet to be disappointed.

These headphones are, most noticeably, built surprisingly well. They are a glossy black with red trim, and the red is a soft rubbery feeling. The sliding mechanism is stainless steel, and the folding has a tactile 'click' into place when opened.

The audio is good. It's not mind blowing, nor is the bass, but it's fairly well rounded and a solid performance, especially for anything in this price range. For the price, they're amazing.

I've used the mic for only one phone call, the other caller was unaware but did not complain and I never had to repeat myself, so I guess it works well enough though that's not why I bought them.

The headphones pair easily enough with two devices, and can play from either one at a time. Powering off if slightly awkward, as it tries to go into pairing before finally shutting off (holding the power/call/pause/play button).

These headphones come with an aux cable to connect them to a standard headphone jack, which was an absolute requirement for me, as I don't want to be reliant on a battery all of the time. They seem to sound slightly better when connected with the backup audio cable, but that might just be my prejudice. The wireless function, if already turned on, will silently deactivate/power off when the aux cable is connected saving the battery. However, because of that, you lose audio/talk controls when using the aux cable. Not a big deal, most wired headphones don't control the music.

Battery life is rated at 12 hours, but I cannot accurately judge that as I usually use them wired. Projected battery life based on what I've used would seem that a 12 hour rating is probably pretty accurate, I havent drained them down past 80% according to my iphone's battery display (yes when paired with iphone it will give the headset's battery level)

Overall, I am ecstatic with these headphones. They even come with a nice velvety drawstring bag to pack them in when not in use.

*Included 3.5 mm audio cable, usb cable, protective soft cloth bag.

*Price. For $35 you have a lot of options in the Bluetooth headphone market. This seems to be the sweet spot for ""Budget"" but not garbage headphones. I originally bought the ultra cheap monoprice 8323 and these blow them away in every way.

*Fit/Comfort: I set out to purchase the cheapest but not garbage circumaural headphones I could find. I prefer the over the entire ear fit when I am listening to music or podcasts alone or playing PUBG on my phone for long sessions. So comfort is a must. The ear pads are nice and cushy. No digging or jabbing plastic anywhere. The top pad(not sure what it is called) isn't something I've even noticed or given any thought, which is a testament to its effectiveness. It just feels nice and cozy when I wear these cans. I have a rather large head and I haven't once felt like these clamp down too tight. But I don't think that they would be too big for anyone with a less than average circumference head. MPOW somehow nailed the springy-ness here without excluding anyone.

Quality/Durability:
I was very surprised to find metal hinges on the foldable parts of the unit. This is a huge plus for a part that will see lots of use.  The majority of the headphones are that cheap(ish) feeling piano black gloss plastic that is a fingerprint magnet. But tough enough that I don't worry about accidentally marring the finish or breaking something with light responsible use. I would not throw these in a backpack every day and expect them to last forever. But I will keep them on my desk or nightstand in my home every day and expect them to last as long as can be reasonably expected.
//on a whim I took out my precision torx set and tested every single screw I could find, and they were all torqued down perfectly. no sloppy fastening here!! big plus.

Styling:
I really really really dislike anything that looks remotely like those silly beats headphones, and that is what initially steered me away from all of MPOW's offerings. however, I am pleased with the look of the Black/Grey option I selected and as I only ever wear these at home I really don't care how they look. All that being said they are really growing on me. I don't feel foolish wearing them and I like that they are stealthy enough to sit on my cluttered desk and not pop out like a sore thumb making me look like I'm trying to appear younger than I am.

Tech stuffs:
Pairing was simple and instant. If I have bluetooth on my phone and I turn on the power to these headphones it instantly syncs and just works, every time. No issues here.

SOUND!: (disclaimer. I am not an audio expert or audiophile. so my terminology and standards will differ from yours.)
S9+, via bluetooth, using google play music, with the EQ set to normal and Dolby Atmos turned on, these headphones sound as good or better as any earbud, IEMs or headphone(wired or bluetooth) that I have owned. Leagues above all the commercial cheap junk (think skullcandy or even lesser quality gas station audio gear)

Parov Stelar .flac sounds vibrant warm and full. no tinny sounds. no muddy sounds. just a wonderfully enveloping aural experience. everything sounds just as I know it should based on hearing it on many different platforms.

Tool -Vicarious Clean, punchy, clear. no missing sounds. can detect every note and instrument. vocals seemed slightly less clear than with other headphones. meh. no biggie here.

Lemon Jelly - Nice Weather for Ducks. (if you are EVER feeling down, play this song. you can thank me later. It is impossible not to smile and be full of love after listening to this sweet tune. )
Lovely bright and warm. After listening to this I feel like I might want to adjust the eq slightly for these cans. But that is in no way a slight against them.
They reproduced every second of this song beautifully. the only critique might be that at full volume the bass is a bit much for my liking, but that seems to be with any pair of sub-audiophile headphones these days, as that's what people want.

Harder Better Faster Stronger (Daft Punk Remix) This is my go to for testing bass as it is punchy but not drawn out or overly used.
These headphones are perfect for this song. Get all that punchy bass and still here all the highs nice and crisp with plenty of separation(nothing sounds too mushed together). Maybe just a touch too much on the low end. But that's just my personal preference.

Bonobo Black Sands(Full Album)
O.M.G. yup. I love these headphones. Sold. Great sound. Perfectly happy. Thank you.

What I don't like:

Included usb cable is too short.

Silly voice when using functions of buttons or powering on/off. I don't need a femanine robot voice to tell me i just turned on my headphones. lights and beeps are fine. lets not pretend were in the 50s still and we want all future tech to talk to us. (I think all the alexas/bixby/ok google/etc are just as silly. so this is just a personal gripe.)

plastic faux metal styling bits in various places. In my experience this stuff is usually the first to fail, whether its the fake metal paint flaking off, or just dulling or looking worn, I generally dislike this type of styling choice as it really is just pretending to be something its not.

If you made it this far. thanks for putting up with my silly pretentious un-educated descriptions. You probably know by now whether or not you want these headphones. If you are in the market for budget headphones with solid quality and your sole purpose in life isn't booty shattering bass, then you can safely purchase these without regret.

And that kinda through me through a loop because I know a device was paired but I still couldn't hear anything until I went back and read the instructions again.

Really great sound quality, durable, stores well because they're foldable, keeps a really good charge, and of course duh they're PINK & BLACK!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😎😎😎😎

UPDATE: Since buying this the top of the cushion is tearing apart! I've only had these a few months! Also it's hard to answer a call from the pause/play button like it's advertised, but it will end the call.

They fit my average-sized head very well.  They feel snug, almost like they could be too snug, but they remain comfortable for several hours.  The look and build quality are nice.  It's all plastic except for a few key parts, but they have a sturdy feel and I find them fairly stylish.  Controls are intuitive, with a typical 4-way circular rocker with a center button--up and down for volume and right and left for track is easy to remember.

I almost took off one star for sound quality, but decided I was being too harsh.  Compared to a $300 pair of headphones, they are a bit lacking, with a sound that is not as crisp and punchy as I would like.  But compared to most under $50 headphones, they are outstanding.  The bass is sufficient and never overbearing and the mids and highs are pretty well balanced and open sounding, just not as 100% fresh as I would wish for.  That said, I think they sound better than a $120 pair of Sony Bluetooth phones I tried recently and returned.

Overall, these are a great value and a very satisfactory product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I sit at a desk all day and I listen to all sorts of things, constantly. Videos, music, movies, etc. The sound quality is fantastic, and absolutely astounding for the price. The bass is great and the fidelity is great. I use these via Bluetooth with a dongle to my PC, and it connects very easily, has never disconnected without my input, and has a pretty decent range. I can also pair both my PC and phone at the same time as separate devices, and it switched back and forth depending on who's playing something. For example, I pair my PC, playing music while I work, and my phone rings, stopping the music and allowing the call to ring in my headphones. Never had that before.

What really got me to come back and write this is the battery life. It's crazy how long these bad boys stay on. I often leave my headphones on and connected to my PC (not on purpose, but because I forget) and this Adonis of headphones stays on and connected the entire night, sometimes over the weekend. When I realize I left them on, I often check the battery life, and (assuming all day use from 100%), it's still not under 40%, I'm not sure if the headphones have some Bluetooth timeout and a sleep function that they don't describe, but I'm honestly super happy with these headphones.

The material quality is also great. I slide them on my head and slide them off one handed every day, multiple times a day, and they show NO signs of wear and tear. Often, plastic surfaces wear down due to oils and friction, but ABSOLUTELY NO plastic surface (inside OR out) would tell you these are a year old. The only dings come from my dropping these on my desk when I take them off, and it's only minor scuffs on the shiny outside. I've never cleaned the headphones, nor ran any maintenance on them, and they look brand new. Also, the ""leather"" padding is not cracked, worn, warped, or stained. Same as the day it arrived.

In the age of planned obsolescence. These headphones stand tall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The quality is excellent and the battery last as long as stated (I charge it every two or three days). Initially I was not going to review it because of the damn beeping that happened intermittently while listening to music. They have a crappy, minimalist instruction that stated the beeping being a result of low battery charge.  That was simply not true. The reason for the beeping is that the product allows you to hook up to two devices. However, if you walk away from your second device, it starts beeping and will not stop until you turn it off and restart it with your current device that's close to it. It took me two months to figure this out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I am not that impressed.This is my honest and  subjective assessment.
Pros:  - Inexpensive set
  - rich sound (especially bass)
  - though not radically sound-canceling, they do a fair enough job
  - cool looking

Cons:  - Somewhat heavy and awkward to manage
  - They feel very tight around my head and on my ears
  -  After a while (20 mins?) my ears get really warm (and achy from the pressure)
  -  Reaching out to the buttons on the right side of the headphone to change tracks, increase volume, etc,
  without taking them off is not that easy and requires some adjusting.
In all honesty I think I will use them during plane rides, but get me another brand for daily use.

I didn't want to spend the money for Bose, so I tried these.  They are exactly what I need.  No one around me can hear sound leakage, and it reduces ambient sound.  (Right now, they are doing construction in the apartment above, and what I hear is the white noise app that plays me rainforest sounds.) I find i can hear loud or sudden outside sounds, but this really reduces the overall annoying noises.
I've taken mine on the plane and the train, which says something if I'm willing to give something space in my travel bag!
I wear these for hours comfortably.  They adjust fit my small head really well.  At the end of a long day, sometimes my head will have a sore spot, but that's usually after hours and hours.  They don't give me the headache that my other earphones did.

They are NOT as noise-cancelling-tight as Bose, and a true audiophile would probably quibble with the sound, but I just wanted to drown out surrounding noise and maybe play some music.

In about 6 months, the head band cushion separated from the headband. Within a year, the headband cracked in 2 places. VERY poor quality.

Though nothing to do with headset quality, when one person is listening to the TV and I am using the headphones, an echo occurs due to delay between the TV speakers and the headphones; in most cases, making them useless.

Nothing to phone home about. If I could do it all over again I would have dished out more money for better quality headphones. The reviews on here can't all be real. BTW, I only use these headphones for music while working out and have had them for about 3 days. So let's start with the basics:

Pros:
1. Cool design and easy to use the controls
2. Easy to pair with iPhone
3. Little to no skipping around when I walk away from my phone w/ the music still playing
4. Foldable headphones makes it easy to put into the carrying case and put into gym bag
5. Stays in place well during workout
6. Volume can get pretty loud

Cons:
1. There is NO BASS. WHATSOEVER. If you want bass....look for another product. I wish I would have listened to the reviews that emphasized this.
2. Not the most comfortable headphones ever. I have a pretty big fro, small ears, although not the smallest head in the world, but I still can't extend the headphones out. The ear pads push into my jaw joint quite often so I am readjusting quite a bit during my workouts.
3. Sound leaks terribly. I like my music loud, but I don't want everyone to hear what I'm listening to (nothing bad, but I listen to pretty vulgar rap music on leg days *Kanye Shrug*). Someone next to to you can definitely hear what you are listening to unless it's on a lower volume.
4. Chewing gum while wearing these irritated the crap out of my TMJ (thanks to the earpads digging into my jaw joint).

Overall. They are very, very average. I will probably use these until I can't stand it anymore...and then dish out big bucks for a better headphone and brand. I really wanted to like these though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Clearly the drivers are under-powered for over-ear sets.

EDIT:
After having keeping these around for a year and a half, I have changed my review from 2 stars to 4 stars.  If you listen to audio in an app that supports equalization, then you can overcome the mid-heavy balance by raising up the low end a lot and suppressing the mids a bit.  Here are the settings I use in the Chrome plugin ""Ears Audio Toolkit"" to get pretty pleasing audio out of Soma.fm and Google Play Music on the web.

I still don't like the fact that holding down the power button may or may not send the headphones into pairing mode before turning them off or fairly loud voice prompts that follow.

They're still new, but they're comfy, they fold up for easy storage while still being adjustable in size, come with a nice bag to sleeve them in, and - most importantly - they sound great.....if you're connecting via the included 3.5mm headphone jack.

The one place they fall short is in the same area a lot of Bluetooth headphones do.  Music sounds like garbage when dealing with Bluetooth audio compression, and unfortunately, they don't appear to have any tricks on hand to offset this issue.  The net result is that music sounds thin and hollow when playing over wireless.  The difference is huge between Bluetooth vs. 3.5mm connections.

Her roommate was a very sweet lady who was very hard-of-hearing, and played her TV at nearly top volume.  These headphones replaced in-ear type earbuds and some cheaper over-ear headphones.  My mom's ears were medium to large, and these fit over her ears without squashing them.  They also worked really well to muffle her roommate's TV, so she could hear her own TV or her audio Bible on her Kindle.  They did not cause a buildup of earwax like the in-ear type of buds, and they did not make the cartilage of my mom's ears sore like the smaller over-ear headphones.  Due to her disability, Mom had a TV stand attached to the foot of her bed, and we used the wired option for both the TV and Kindle.  I did test the Bluetooth with my iPhone and it worked fine, but I cannot comment on constant use and battery life for Bluetooth.  My mom has since passed away, and I have kept these for my own use.  I actually like them better than my Monster noise canceling over-ear headphones.  Their sound is similar to my smaller Klipsch over-ear headphones.  I am not an audio expert, but my impression is that the sound in these and my Klipsch headphones is ""crisper"" than the sound from my Monsters.  I really love my Klipsch headphones, but they put pressure on the cartilage of my ears (I inherited Mom's ears!), so I can only wear them for an hour or so.  Thes Mpows are comfortable for an extended time due to the size and padding of the earcups and the padding on the head strap.

I was blown away by the sound quality, comfort, and sturdiness of these headphones. Bluetooth works perfectly for music played from my phone (as well as phone calls) and I'm able to get through a week's worth of use with battery life to spare. The headphones even survived a few falls without any issues for over a year.

I take half a star off because when the headphones are in use in Bluetooth mode, the control panel will flash intermittently and there's no way to turn it off. Not a problem during the day, but if you're trying to listen in a dark room then it will be distracting.

The package comes with a small cloth bag for travel, a cable to plug the headphones directly into a device (handy for flights or if you don't otherwise want to use up the battery), and a charging cable (takes about 4 hours to charge).

After 16 months of solid use, I'd accidentally bumped the headphones off of my bed and the control panel popped off the headphones and wouldn't snap back into place, making it impossible to turn the headphones off/on. I was disappointed but ready to order another pair because I was so happy with them.

I came across these while shopping and after reading about 20 reviews I said what the heck, If they were garbage I would return them and bite the bullet and buy another Bose headset.

To my surprise this headset is awesome.  Great look, it paired with my IPhone on the first try, and I was amazed at the sound.  So amazed that I unplugged it, plugged my Bose back in and could hardly tell the difference.  I don't know much about the battery life, but it doesn't matter because I was tethered with the Bose for 10 years.  From the reviews I've read the battery life is great.

Only negative is at full volume the people next to you ""may"" hear your music.  No big deal as I usually wear them while on a flight and most the passengers around me have headsets on anyway.

Q. How do they sound?
A. Excellent! In truth, they have very little character of their own, which is a good thing, a VERY good thing. The bass is not as extended as some much more expensive phones, but what's there is clean and not boomy as some have reported. What really impresses me is their ability to portray depth, which isn't easy for a sealed design. There is no upper midrange ""clarity bump,"" zippy highs or serious resonances. They compare very well with my much more expensive wireless Sennheisers in fact.

I bought these for hearing protection while mowing the lawn, but their comfort, great sound and ease of use makes me think I'll be using them for indoor use, commuting and dogwalking as well.

I purchased these because my partner had just gotten a pair of brand-name noise-canceling over-ear headphones for $250+ and I liked them so much, I purchased these to try them out. I really did not expect this quality; they are not entirely noise canceling, but drown out a significant amount of noise around you (even without playing anything on them). There is no white noise feature, which I don't mind. It charges quite quickly and can be used via cord or wireless via Bluetooth. The battery life is astounding, which gets me to the negative: The Bluetooth feature needs work. Due to the limited product's button capabilities (whereby holding the center is used to connect/disconnect to Bluetooth, turn on/off), I had a hard time learning how to properly connect and disconnect my devices from Bluetooth, it automatically pairs to something and always calls it ""Phone 1"" even if it is not a phone (thereby causing confusion because when I turn the device on, it is sometimes a guessing game of where the sound might come from), and the button feature does not always work fully. For instance, you are supposed to hold down the center of the button for 4 seconds in order to command Bluetooth, then again to power on/off. However, my pair of headphones are a bit rebellious in the sense that they do not always work when I try to hold the button down, sometimes it tries to re-pair to a Bluetooth device rather than turn off, and I have noticed that sometimes it says the power is off but it does not turn off. All of this is done via a voice that tells you, and so make sure the device is off before an important meeting or event that requires being quiet... this device has randomly talked during meetings because it never properly turned off as it said, and then 30 minutes into the meeting (because yes, it will go on standby for that long!), you could hear my purse go, ""Power off."" Though this can be annoying or inconvenient, the price makes it for the most part worth it; my main issue is that it will tell me it powers off and then it doesn't. I was recently having an issue with not hearing sound from my computer, and it is because the headphones (which were last paired to my phone NOT the computer!!!) had never turned off as the voice command told me, and so all my sound was in the headphones... I thought my computer's sound was broken and was ready to have it checked out, but it turned out to be the headphones acting erratically. The headphones had not been touched since turning them off and were stored in my desk drawer whereby nothing could have ushered it to turn on, and since it had been at least 10 hours since I had last used the headphones, I guess I should be impressed with the amount of charge it can hold without dying from being on! All this said, they are not the most convenient to maneuver and not the best on-the-go due to the pairing issues, restrictive/limited button features, and the fact that a voice has to alert me when certain actions are taking place (of which can sometimes erroneously tell me it is off or paired when it is not), but otherwise they do what they are supposed to do for 1/10 of the price of my partner's noise-canceling headphones. I also cannot emphasize enough that the sound quality is very good.. I have over-the-ear headphones from a pricey company that is well-known for its headphones and speakers, and the sound on them is actually not as high quality sounding as this pair. I also appreciate the fact that the headphones are adjustable and accommodate ears that are bigger, like mine :-) I feel 4 stars is fitting for the average person (or student like myself), though may be closer to a 3 if you need something with more consistency/reliability, and a 5 if you are in dire need of headphones and do not mind the negative aspects I mentioned!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

There is one thing to caution you about with these phones: the sound is bright. If you love Klipsch and B&W stereo speakers (and I do), you'll love these headphones. My wife is more of a fan of Bose speakers, and she prefers to dampen the sound on her phone or tablet when she uses them. (We actually have two pairs: pink for her, silver for me.)

The sound is great, the feel is great. They're a great easy buy for anyone that can't shell out more.

I have two gripes and both of them are things that will be problems with anyone that purchases these headphones. They aren't the 'rare' case that happens and the person comes in with a bad review because of it.

The first problem is the cord. It's thin, it's very vulnerable, and for me it's been having sound problems since about... week three. But I'm VERY harsh on cords. And even though it had problems since then, it still works great, I just have to be careful not to yank it.

The second problem I've supplied the picture for. This started happening on one side really quickly. And I don't know if it's because of 'sliding' my headphones on. But it got worse over time. It seems to be staying in the left and right sides and won't come out fully. So if it doesn't bother you, it's also an easy thing to live with.

Overall, these headphones do what they need to do. They are easily some of the most comfortable headphones I've owned, and the sound is great. And this is coming from someone that blares music as loud as I possibly can.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound im disapointed with, it sounds muffled. I listened to some music with these and then compared it to just my standard apple headphones that come with iphone. the difference was immediately noticeable. It is muffled, the sound is quieter, and overal just does not sound good. The mic is also not good according to my fiance. He only tends to complain about the quality of the call when i use these, compared to my old apple earbuds. I wouldnt know since i cant hear myself but since he complains even when i dont tell him im using them i assume it is infact the headphones. The headphones also tend to tell me they are at “max volume” but then i look at my device and i can CLEARLY see there is much more volume to go. Very disappointing. Will not order again.

UPDATE 3/15

I received a new pair of headphones from the company an no charge since i was not really satisfied as mentioned above, and personally i still dont like them but my fiance and his friend really like them. Im probably just picky with headphones, and that is not really the headphones fault so i went ahead and changed my review from 2 stars.

Second, the control wheel is a smooth wheel with no texture.  I can't tell what buttons I'm pressing!  Solution?

Coupled with the good battery life, and the awesome backup physical cord for those non-Bluetooth-enabled devices, I have an overall positive impression of these, particularly for the price point.

I have noticed one minor con:  I occasionally notice an audio glitch while using them.  I suspect this might be due to the fact that I have these paired with multiple devices, and there's usually at least two in range at any given time.  I have been, perhaps, a wee bit too lazy to unpair those other devices to test that theory, so don't put too much stock in that.  Your experience may differ.

UPDATE:  I have verified that the audio glitches are indeed caused by having more than one device connected at a time.  It can be quite maddening at times.  These are fantastic headphones if you are using it with a single device.  Be wary with multiple devices, particularly if the devices automatically connect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

This device completely fails as a headset.  For some reason, whenever the mic is switched on, sound no longer comes out of the headphones channel.  While making calls, this means both the mic and audio devices must be set to ""HEADSET"" not ""HEADPHONES.""  During calls this means:
1) god-awful audio quality
2) you will not be able to hear audio out of any other program running, i.e. you will not be able to use these headsets to game with a friend unless you have another pair of speakers.

People also complained about the audio quality of the mic.  This is probably just due to the seemingly limited bandwidth between the bluetooth receiver and the headphones.  I can tell you that call quality on my other pair of bluetooth headphones is about 10x better due to the limitation outlined above.

Tested on Windows 10.

I'll be returning these and buying something else.

ORIGINAL REVIEW

I rated these headphones a 3/5 but I’m returning them. They look nice right out the box, nice and shiny but definitely smudges with no effort. You can touch the glossy finish with a dry knuckle and still leave a mark.  They’re comfortable on my big head and funny ears. Bluetooth connection was fairly easy. It was in sync with all the media displaying on my phone which is something I often worry about when dealing with bluetooth. These worked just fine. The sound quality was decent for the price, yes the bass isn’t the best like many other reviewers have said. No big deal I guess, it wasn’t terrible. I bet you’re wondering why I’m returning them. Well, my girlfriend came home while I was testing them out, and I asked her what she thinks. She instantly said she doesn’t like them, she can loudly hear everything I’m listening to while they’re on my head!  I said “No way!”.  I let her put them on and she was right. I could hear what she was listening to clearly. I could make out the lyrics and everything. Even if she turned down the volume to 50% it’s still sounds pretty loud and clear to me. I don’t travel much, but I have a trip in a couple weeks and I bought these for my plane ride. I would definitely be disturbing everyone around me if I’m on the plane listening to the tasteless low-class music I like to listen to sometimes. I’m surprised so much sound is able to escape like that because I even asked my girlfriend to yell at me while I had them on and I could barely hear her. So... they do a good job of keeping outside sound out, but a bad job of keeping inside sound in, and that’s a deal breaker for me. They’ll give me no privacy. I hope this helps.  I wish someone else mentioned this in their review when I was reading them.  Maybe they don’t even know the headphones do this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Kelsey","Technical and Customer service","February 16, 2019","It has been a year since I bought two sets of these excellent headphones.  I was able to pair and use both sets for about a year, enjoying the enhanced listening.  About a month ago, one set stopped pairing with the bluetooth transmitter we had connected to our stereo and TV systems.  I got out the manuals for both the headphones and the transmitter and tried everything in both manuals to get them to pair again but was unsuccessful.  I contacted the Mpow tech/customer service and they gave me additional tips not included in their manual to try to get them to pair.  Ultimately, we were unsuccessful.  And then I got a very pleasant surprise:  Mpow offered to send a replacement set of headphones even though the problem set was far out of warranty.  For those who are old enough to remember the stories of how Sears and JCPenney became the giants of American retail 100 years ago, part of your recollections may include stories about this type of customer service as well as the axiom 'The Customer is Always Right'.

Audio quality on these will disappoint almost anyone who's spent $40 or more on wired headphones in the past, muddled and thick mid and upper ranges without the bass to at least make it interesting. Build quality has that Mpow signature creaky plastic that you'll hear popping about even when you're sitting down wearing them with music playing. Fit is comfortably tight early on but weakens within a week. Buttons feel like they're about to break at any minute.

To their credit, the battery life is better than any Mpow Bluetooth gadget I've owned, and the range also beats their past efforts considerably, easily reaching 30 feet through multiple walls while showing few signs of interference. Dual-pairing feature is nice, but only the device it recognizes as ""phone 1"" responds to controls, and thanks to macOS's inability to let go of bluetooth audio devices when sleeping will fail to work and beep incessantly if paired with a Macbook/MBP/MBA that's been closed up and tossed in a bag.

When I first got them, they clamped too tightly on my head (which would be great for exercising, but I wear them for hours at a desk). To stretch them out, I put them around a box for a couple nights (the Amazon box they came in) and now they fit comfortably. I also noticed they are more comfortable for my head if I wear them backward (controls on the left side) so the ear pads don't rest on my jaw. They are heavier than headphones without Bluetooth, so my head will tire faster (but that comes with the territory).
For reference: my head is about average for an adult female.

  Being able to control my music playback is a very nice feature.  I usually fire up a playlist or similar and being able to skip ahead to the next song, adjust the volume, etc. is a real benefit.
Wired option
  Great option for listening to non-bluetooth sources or when the battery is dead
Comfort
  Nice padding on the ear cups.  Some extra padding on the head strap would be better.

The not so good:
Sound quality
  Terribly boomy but what do you expect at this price point.  Don't expect audiophile studio headphones or you will be really disappointed.
Instructions
  The horrible little foldout with mostly pictographs is pretty awful.  It gets the main points across but there's no troubleshooting or other real information.

The jury is out on:
Battery life?
Durability

Nastri","Very nice value for bluetooth headphones (foldable / wired AND wireless / good build quality)","January 29, 2017","Need a nice value bluetooth headphones with durability, good sound quality, & can be wireless OR wired? This MPOW headphone is it!

*Unit Operational Test*
This is a pretty simple unit to test. I started with testing fitment / adjustment to my head using the sliders (stainless steel sliders, nicely done!) while also testing the ability for folding the headphones (worked great, very solid feeling). The memory foam ear cushions and along the inside of the headphone band where the top of your head will touch feel very comfortable with good spring in the foam. It is an attractive set of headphones, good use of contrast red, silver, and black. The device is touted to NOT be active noise canceling so we'll test passive noise reduction with the over-the-ears cushions.

The device has user controls on one side (power, volume up, volume down, track forward, track reverse, play / pause) on the right-ear side. My Test: 1) Turn on the Headphones ... you'll heard a clear voice 'Power On' message. 2) Turn on Bluetooth on your phone and pair the MPOW headphones / connect. 3) Start up your preferred music or audio smartphone app. 4) Operate the headphones (connected and streaming from your BT-enabled phone) for 10 hours continuous streaming and wired mode (using the supplied 3.5mm audio cable) along with conducting a test phone call. Then power off the headphones.

I used my primary phone, a new Nexus 6P as my initial test. I turned on the headphones (the headphones provide an initial
""powering on"" along withe a ""not paired"" audio cue), then paired the device and connected by phone using Bluetooth (yet another audio cue ""phone 1 connected""). I next started up one of the music apps. Eureka, it works!. Sound quality is quite good especially at this price (little emphasis in the mid-band imo). I can confirm no active noise cancellation but with the nature of the ear cushions I did experience reduce ambient noise when the headphones were on and in use. Sound can get LOUD but yet clear (no distortion nor crackling), which is nice to see. You won't get thumping base or highs, but that's to be expected.

I next disconnected from bluetooth and attempted to test wired connection using the supplied 3.5mm audio cable that was supplied by MPOW to connect to my phone's headphone jack. The MPOW worked well in wired mode! Very handle to have both wired and wireless modes. I lastly powered off the headphones (nice touch for an audio ""powered off"" confirmation cue).

My next test was to make 2 phone calls (one to my home landline phone and one to my cellular voicemail). Calls were very clear and quite loud (with the headphone volume turned all the way up), and everyone could hear me fine using the built-in mic. This test completed successfully as well.

*Recharging*
The MPOW Bluetooth Headphones offers built-in rechargable battery (420 mAH) that is rated to last up to 13 hours of continuous music time or 15 hours of talking time. I've done a test with the headphones running while streaming music using bluetooth, my test ended after 10 hours and it was still running! That's more than enough run-time for me.

I tested recharging as well using the micro-usb port (found on the same side as the user controls). You'll see a red led light come on.. It took me several hours for a full recharge after using for 10 hours straight in my music playback test.

*Build Quality*
Very solidly built device. Not in the same league materials-wise as Bose but also not in the same price range. Good use of sturdy plastics, memory foam as the ear cushion, stainless steel for the adjustable sliders. The unit's folding capability also worked well, very solid feeling along the hinges. Good fit and finish overall.

*Conclusion*
This MPOW Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear delivers in what they said this device could do. It connects seamlessly to your BT-enabled phone and can play streamed audio but also can accept a wired connection (no battery charge needed in wired mode!), the headphone design is foldable (great for travel & storage in general). It's a solidly-built and comfortable-to-wear device. Mpow offers a 45-day money back guarantee and a 18-month worry-free guarantee as well (I've not yet needed to take advantage on the other Mpow items I've bought in the past, all are working great). I would happily recommend these headphones to friends and family, especially for the value & flexibility to use in wireless or wired mode.

I bought them for a work trip that had me doing a lot of travel. They're comfortable, they block outside noise well, they fold down nice, the controls are easy to use, they sound good, the battery life is solid. They quickly became a part of my every day. I was using these things all the time and thrilled that they were so nice for such a reasonable price.

Then the battery died. I hadn't even had them for 6 months and the battery died. What I should have done here is go through Amazon to deal with this, but I contacted MPow directly. They responded reasonably quickly and asked that I send the headphones back to them. They said they would check them and send back replacements. They even covered my shipping costs. At this point I was entirely satisfied with the process. Things break, parts die, I get it. But this is where it went south...

After an extended wait, I received my replacement headphones. They were all scratched up, the hinges were loose, the ear padding was beat up, the play/pause button looked like someone had taken a thumb tack to it, and the line in jack was all beat up. They looked like hell. On top of that, one end of the line in cable was snapped off. I don't know if they worked, I never tried them. When I contacted MPow about it, they just said to send them back and they would issue a refund. That's fine, but what I wanted was a working pair of headphones. I've now spent several weeks dealing with this, and have a bad taste in my mouth about MPow. It's an acceptable outcome, I guess, but I'm really disappointed at how the whole interaction went.

SO. These are really nice headphones. They had become essential gear for my everyday workflow. When they died, MPow basically shrugged. I got my money back, which is nice, but what I wanted was working headphones that hadn't spent three weeks in the bottom of a high schooler's backpack.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These headphones aren't the worst I've ever used but they definitely aren't the best. I've got a pretty big head and they are able to be adjusted to fit my big dome quite comfortably. They feel like they're decently made. Some headphones that are this style feel like they'll break in half when you put them over your head, luckily these don't feel that flimsy - but I still don't want to toss them around too much.

I wear them in 2 situations, 1 in which they perform exceptionally and another where they leave some to be desired. Situation 1 - around the house after work when I listen to podcasts, the perform very well. The voice of the podcasters are clear and rich. The ability to leave my phone stationary charging up and still use headphones is clutch. Situation 2 - at the gym, listening to music. The bass boost in these headphones is too much for my musical interests - mostly metal music. The low end of these headphones tends to muddy the guitars and midrange sounds. If you listen to EDM or something similar they tend to sound better with this style of music. If you listen to heavy metal, I'd pass on these. My last complaint is that these headphones keep my head hot while I'm at the gym because the ear coverings are so large. I'll get so hot that I'll have to take them off and wipe off my disgustingly sweaty head. So there's that.

What else is included? There's a carrying bag that's made from a similar material as the Crown Royal bags, if you're familiar with those. There's a micro-USB cable and a 3.5mm audio cable, both about 4 feet long.

I included a dollar in my pictures for scale.

**UPDATE**

After my review I was contacted by customer support regarding my displeasure with the headphones. They offered 3 potential solutions:
1) send a different set of the same model,
2) a similar model they suggested,
3) or offered to send me a model of my choosing.

I know some people like these poofy headphones but they've never impressed me so I went with option 3 and chose the MPOW Cheetah headphones and have been really impressed with them. I'd give them a solid 7/10 on audio quality. There are certainly limitations regarding audio quality when it comes to ear bud style headphones but these definitely play heavy metal in an extremely satisfactory way. Not too bassy, pretty clear highs and mids.

I like that I'm able to turn the volume up beyond what my phone suggests because c'mon, there's a reason I can't hear in the first place (listening to my headphones too loud...#cantstopwontstop). The buttons feel solid and have already taken quite a bit of use, because I'm always skipping songs. I think everybody does though, so I'm good there. The only thing that's a little counterintuitive, at least to me, regarding the buttons is that to change to the next song you have to click the volume down button. That just takes some getting used to but is hardly a negative.

Like most ear buds, after extended use they start to cause some discomfort in the ear. But that's not a negative as much as it's an indication to rejoin the rest of the world. If anything it's a feature.

Overall I've been very impressed with the MPOW Cheetahs, I'd give them 5/5. I stopped using the original headphones entirely, actually. The battery lasts a couple of days before needing to be recharged, though, to be honest I'll usually proactively charge it after 3 or 4 days.

It's been a while since I got these so I can't remember if it came with a micro-USB cable or not, I don't seem to have an extra anywhere though. Honestly I'm glad, I've got so many already I'm glad I don't have another. But it is a micro-USB slot.

TL:DR Anyway, to wrap this up: I do not recommend the MPOW poofy over ear headphones initially reviewed. I highly recommend the MPOW Cheetahs, though, 5/5.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Pros:
- Style. These look amazing! Seriously, I get compliments almost every day when I wear them out. People keep asking me if they're Beats. Clearly, they've never seen Beats before lol
- Comfort. These are surprisingly comfortable. I have larger ears, and these fit very comfortably around them. Sure there's slight discomfort at times and some sweating, but that's to be expected with over ear. I can confidently say that I can wear these for 4 hours and not really need to take them off once.
-Multi-device support. So convenient to connect my phone and my laptop to these at the same time so I don't have to keep switching back and forth.
- Navigation. It's incredibly easy to use, and connecting is a breeze. Once you're connected, you never have to worry about it and can cycle through everything without touching what these are connected to. The clickable buttons are perfect for not guessing what button you're using.

Cons:
- Range. These are absolutely horrible sometimes with regards to range. I'll have my phone in my pocket, and sometimes the sound will go out while I'm walking. I had a pair of Bluedio Turbine's before this, and they enabled me to leave my phone in my bedroom and go to my kitchen without any problem (yes even with walls in the way), these however, can barely get through a song when I walk more than 7 feet away. Disgraceful.
- Sound Quality. Let me start off by saying these aren't bad on sound persay. However, my personal tastes just weren't met. If you're a hip hop or r&b lover, these aren't the headphones for you. The bass on my Bluedio's wasn't the greatest but it did the trick, these however, sound like the bass is happening two rooms away from you. Very disappointing. I never tested quality with the aux cable, because let's be real, these are Bluetooth headphones, if I wanted wired headphones, I would've bought some.
- Phone Calls. While everyone could hear me fine, there was always a strange clicking noise in the background according to those on the other side. Apparently it got really annoying at times. I never had trouble hearing other people. Otherwise, answering and hanging up we're a breeze.
- Battery Life. I charged my Bluedio's maybe once every week. Granted, I'm a heavier than average user, but these headphones barely lasted two days. Really frustrating when I have to keep them plugged in all the time.

Overall, you're getting what you pay for. However, compared to others of the same price, this sacrifices a lot just for minor improvements in aesthetics and comfort. If only these had more bass in them and a longer battery life, I think I'd be happier. For now, to the junk drawer you go.

Update 03/2018:
I have received extremely courteous and helpful customer service from this product's manufacturer, Patozon. They promptly contacted me after my review was posted, listened to my concerns, and provided me with a replacement product (Mpow H1). While the Mpow H1 was definitely better than the Mpow 059, it still had some similar issues while lacking the sleekness in design. All-in-all, I am extremely impressed with the customer service I received from Patozon, and will definitely consider them for my future purchases. However, as my original review was tied to the product and not the company, my stars remain the same.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Good budget pair of headphones, though here are some of my thoughts:

• Sound Quality - Decent, not the best but GOOD
• Bluetooth Battery Life - Charges quickly, and works for a few hours. Oh and also the buttons on the side only works with Bluetooth. The button presses are delayed to the MAX, and they're difficult to figure out which button is which when blindly pressing them.
• Comfort - These headphones hurts the top of my head after wearing them for some time, but the cushions are pretty okay. They're pretty lightweight too, but they give bad headphone hair.
• Price - I bought these headphones for about 40 bucks, an okay price for a pair of headphones like these

Overall, I would recommend these to anybody who wants to buy budget headphones. Honestly you could just save up a little longer for some BETTER headphones, but if you're stuck with just a little money, then go for these. They work incredibly well wired, but wireless can be a bit annoying. They include a little carrying pouch for it too, which is nice, but it might not protect your headphones from major falls or damages. They're pretty portable so you shouldn't have trouble fitting these in your bag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They are comfortable, without question, but I can't wear them for more than two hours at a time because my ears sort of overheat. I actually prefer earbuds now for that reason. But if you're looking for over-the-head style headphones, that's irrelevant. I cannot recommend MPOW regardless for two reasons:
1 - Poor construction. After 1 year the plastic part that goes over your head broke *on both sides*. Right below the telescoping connector on the left side, and right above the connector on the right side. They still work but it is clearly a bad design.
2 - The software MPOW has for Windows bluetooth audio says ""Maximum Volume"" and ""Mute"" whenever you go all the way up or down on the window volume control. Often times I'll hit the down-volume button to shut off music, and it'll reach 0 volume over and over as each repeated keystroke is interpretted as a separate lower-volume command. This results in the headphones shouting ""MUTE"" ""MUTE"" ""MUTE"" over and over. It's enough to drive you crazy. I mean it's a really bad problem and I can't believe nobody at MPOW caught this during their QA process.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

PS4 does not support Bluetooth audio devices. I read other reviews and even asked in the questions if it could be used and was told yes. This answer is misleading.

By itself the headset cannot be used for ps4. If you get a Bluetooth transmitter to plug into the usb slot on the ps4 then you can use this headset.

 As for the headset,  it's a wonderful sleek headset.  It's very small and compact. When folded it takes up very little space. A charging cable,  aux cable and felt drawstring storage bag are included with it.  I would highly reccommend upgrading to the hardshell case made for this headset if you want good protection.

The sound is quite good on these and the over the ear muffs are very comfortable. It charged very quickly and is shooter easy to pair to a device. These have some of the best sound out of all the headsets I've owned and at the price it's a true bargain. The sleek design gets rid of the clunky headset feeling and they're so comfortable I actually forget that I'm wearing them. When no sound is playing there is a audible background static like noise when they're turned on,  but it's not much of an issue if you're going to be playing music or watching something.  Highly reccommend these for purple who want a compact and sleek headset that delivers in sound quality and comfort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Don't expect perfection, but every time someone borrows my headphones, the first comment on is how the noise around them disappears.

The battery life is amazing. I charge these maybe once a month and I use them almost daily - while studying, at the gym, or while taking a walk.

My only complaint is they are not perfect when it comes to staying on my head while running. They stay on my ears just fine, but the band slowly slips back as I run. But since these weren't made with high physical activity in mind, it gets a free pass.

They are comfortable on the ears. Sometimes, with certain earrings, I have to do a little bit of adjusting.

While the material and feel are pretty good, in addition to how they look and the long battery life, head phones are supposed to do one thing and they should do it well. These head phones fail in audio quality.

The audio quality on these head phones is horrendous (so bad that after having them for a week I’ve bought another headset of a different brand).

Now retired I was just looking for a pair to listen to Audible audio books in bed that would be comfortable. I went through many different pairs offered through Amazon some good sounding but all didn't last, channels going out, cushions falling off, etc.

These are great for the price at this point three months later I am using them for everything, at this very moment I am listening to an ELO concert off my TV and I'm blown away at the sound quality. Since this is a Samsung smart TV, they don't give you any way to hook up headphones wired or Bluetooth, so I needed to buy an optical converter since that was the only audio output available. I tried pairing every other Bluetooth set I had then finally pulled my MPOW 059's out of the bedroom and they paired in seconds.

Now I need to find a smaller MPOW pair to use in the living room for my late night TV watching, maybe I'll have to get in touch with MPOW for suggestions for the best small pair with good music reproduction and speech intelligibility, I'm spoiled now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Initially, I really liked these headphones, but now after using them regularly over the past few months, my opinion has totally changed. (see original review below) For the first few months, they worked great, but now I regularly get these VERY loud interruptions to the audio I am listening to. Intermittently, the speakers will produce a VERY loud distortion sound that I can best describe as a combination of fuzzy static and a loud screech. It is always much much louder than whatever I am listening to which is completely jarring, and honestly quite frightening when listening to something quieter/gentler. (It is so unexpected and loud that it has made me physically jump). This is now happening more and more frequently, now occurring multiple times during a listening session (30min - 2hrs).
This issue can't be caused by wear and tear because I have never even dropped my headphones or subjected them to any physical handing that would cause damage. They are either on my ears, or sitting on my desk.

I also know that this issue can't be caused by a specific app or my phone, because it consistently occurs with multiple apps while using the headphones and has never occurred with any other bluetooth (or wired) device I have used with my phone.
Overall, I am very disappointed with these, especially since I spent a lot of time shopping around and I thought I had finally found a reliable pair of bluetooth headphones.

The quality sound is really good and the Bluetooth connection doesn't lag at all. Also, I've been using them the entire week via wireless around 4h/day and I hadn't need to charge  them at all.

UPDATE: I recently came in need to use the ""built-in"" mic. 1.) It's really annoying that it cannot be used over the wire. But the description said it before, so it's fine. 2.) The mic won't work even with wireless, tried it with multiple devices and nothing.

UPDATE #2: Months after this review, I was contacted by Patozon (seller) letting me know that because of my review, a replacement was sent for me. The ones sent were a more recent model (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HPB1HQ/ ) and worked flawlessly, these ones actually have a better sound quality, a bit bigger over ear cover (which was pretty convenient since the other ones hurt a bit after using them for long periods of time) and the mic worked just as good.

First, as headphones. They are very good and very comfortable. I would consider them pretty flat and I mean that in a positive way. I mean that they are pretty realistic sounding and warm. I am comparing them side by side with several other headphones in the house and all dollar levels: my son's Beats, my corded Monster NTunes, my daughter's brand x headphones and I would say without question these are the most pleasant to listen to for an extended period of time. They do get a little warm on the ears after a while (an hour or so) as they are over the ear so that's pretty standard but I find them quite comfortable to wear, even with my glasses on. For certain types of music or if you like that Beats artificially boosted bass, these may not be for you unless you have an EQ to boost the bass but they sound really good for many different types of music and since they are slightly warmer and less bright compared to the Beats and others, I find I can wear them much longer without ear fatigue so I am actually listening to music while working far more, which is great. Also, from a noise limiting perspective, they are good; as are most well padded over the ear headphones.

Next and why I really got them, I was looking for a good all in one jack of all trades headphone/headset combo for work and travel and am tired of earbuds. After a little trial and error I was able to get them to work in VOIP for WebEx on my laptop which is awesome for me. That and the fact that they can be wireless and wired is great. The mic only works wireless via Bluetooth but that's fine and people tell me it sounds great and they are surprised when I tell them it's Bluetooth over VOIP so that's a big win. Also, the Bluetooth range is great. If my laptop is in the middle of the house downstairs, I can travel through almost the entire house, even upstairs and not lose the connection at all.

While I was troubleshooting the WebEx mic thing, I did reach out to their support team via email. While I solved the trouble without their help, and their help was pretty generic and not specific to my issue, their multiple responses were prompt. For the money, I think they are a very good product. I give it four stars because time will tell. My last Mpow earbuds had the battery stop charging after about a year so that was disappointing. Since they batteries are not replaceable, even at this price they are not something I want to be buying annually so if I can get a few years out the battery and they don't snap or fail in some other way in the coming months, I will consider them a five star purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Wilder","Poor battery quality, outstanding customer service!","November 8, 2019","The first pair were defective, bu they were replaced with new ones and they worked great for 6 months. I use them everyday at work. They're comfortable and have been very trouble free until the last two weeks. The battery barely lasts 6 hours after an overnight charge. They start to beep the low power warning after 6 hours or so, but if I charge them for 5 minutes, they last hours longer. If I had to go back in time, I would not have bought these and won't buy another pair from this manufacturer. It's too bad, because I really like them otherwise.

Update: I'm not sure how, but I was sent another pair of headphones, these seem like a newer or higher-end pair. I would assume that someone with the company or retailer saw my review and sent them to me. These new ones work great right out of the box! I'm very impressed with the way this company has dealt with me, taking initiative to ensure I am satisfied.

Mpow customer service = A++++
By far the best quality & value on the market

There is no better sound, build quality, & value on the market. I'm a 25+ audio professional and I can assure that the ONLY perceptible improvement in sound quality will be in headphones in the $300+ price range

Received the cans & fired them up right away to check for charge which they had. On day 4 of what seemed like nonstop all day use with no charging needed the multifunction power button began only working intermittently. Shortly after the can on that same side began cutting out. They remain this way

I'm going to try to contact seller/mpow before just returning. With as many sold & widespread rave reviews I believe I must have got one of those rare defects that slipped by & my experience is not a reflection of the product/company as a whole

Hopefully I will be able to amend this review

Amendment pt1 - Mpow customer service is absolutely top notch! Prompt, courteous response & offer of a solution. One could not hope for a better or more timely resolution. I'm going to take a little time to put the 059s through they're paces, get them properly broken in,  see that there no issues as prior, etc & I'll be back with final opinion. As of now I'm right back on par with my initial impressions, possibly even more impressed after dealing with Mpow regarding problems. TBC

Pt2 - ended up deciding to not keep these. Due to the depth of the earcups they pressed down on my ears causing severe pain. Could not wear for an hour without developing a headache that was agonizing long after removing the headphones

Pt 3 - Again, customer service is top notch, A+++, some of if not the best I've ever dealt with. I wish every product/service provider operated at this company's level. That having been said  .....

They reached out to me asking if I would be interested in trying a different set of headphones to which I reply absolutely yes. They sent me a pair of mpow H1 Bluetooth wireless headphones

... I'm loving the H1 even more than the 059. I'm aware that this model is supposed to be a step down from the 059 but to me they felt better, seemed a higher quality, as well as sounded better, & continued to do so the longer they ""burned in"". I am absolutely in love with them as my test period progresses

Another aspect im in love with is your customer service. The lengths you have gone to to try to satisfy, recitify the situation & make me a happy customer are well above & beyond what would be considered ""normal"" & %100 top notch""

Conclusion -
One cannot go wrong with Mpow products. For their class & price range the are BY FAR the best buy in headphones on the market!

Honestly, the build quality is nice but that is it. I tried these headphones on music and can only compare them to cheap headphones. They sound as if you are listening to music through a can. All midrange, and very shallow. No low end bass and the highs are muffled. So who ever said they are comparable to Beats, they are not. But if you just want some big over ear bluetooth headphones and don't care about the audio quality, they are good for the price. The noise reduction they offer are due to your ear being enclosed by the ear foam. And just to be clear, Beats headsets are not great either, but at least they have a full sound range even if the bass is excessive and boomy. But if you had a good set like a Harmon Kardon Flat set and want a replacement, look elsewhere. You will be disappointed.

Update 8/16: my initial review of these headphones have not changed. However, the sellers are amazing and care about the quality of their product. I have nothing bad to say about their customer support. They provided me with a ""better"" quality headphone because of my dissastisfaction. They sent over the Mpow H2. My review of the H2 are similar to the review above. The physical quality is decent though look and few a little less sturdy than the 059 and are more on-ear headset rather over ear. I like that they are not as loud and flashy in design as the 059. But that is just personal preference.

In terms of audio quality, they suffer from the same over amplified midrange. The bass response is a little better than the 059, but still feels like you are hearing everything though a can. The sound can only be compared with cheap headphones. Once again, not a set of headphones i would choose if i cared about how my music sound. The H2 feels a little more defined because of the bass response, but the highs are shallow and barely audible. The mid range is extremely shallow with no clarity, and remains the loudest frequency band over everything else. I would still suggest Beats even if i think they are terrible headphones, but at least they have a balanced range of sound.

I am not their target audience/buyer. So unless they improve their sound to maybe get close to a Bose over ear headphone, i would not buy as a replacement. But i guess its fine if you just want a wireless headset that you can really beat up and not feel bad because at the price point, its replaceable. My score remains at 2 star.

But 5 stars to customer support.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Glad to see they did charge as many complained about them not. However-went to pair with phone...nothing! Tried multiple times every kind of way I could think of to pair. Phone never found the device or anything called mpow. I am so mad that I bought this worthless piece of junk! All I can say is the reviews of how wonderful this product is have to be paid. Don't waste your time on this worthless piece of junk. Amazon should be ashamed for even selling this product. I bought these specifically for use when watching tv. I specifically put in the search bar ""headphones for tv"". Up pops all these choices including this one. It very clearly advertised for PC/Cell/TV. So to me, that meant it was tv ready when you got it...not that you needed to buy a separate adapter for it so that I can watch tv with it. If I knew that, I wouldn't have bought these, I would've gotten a different pair, yes they would've been a little more expensive, but they would've done what I wanted them to do. I wouldn't have minded if it would've said in the description you need to purchase an adapter separate. Nowhere did I see that. I didn't notice anyone mentioned that in their reviews. I guess everyone is only using them for music on their phones. I can buy any old earbuds for that. Maybe nobody else cares that it's not tv ready, but wanted to put it out there in case somebody else is looking for that.

Sound Compares Well to Beats Solo2 Wireless and Sony MDRXB650BT/B. Tight fit.","October 1, 2017","I tested these against two other headphones: Beats Solo2 Wireless On-Ear Headphone - Silver (Old Model) and Sony MDRXB650BT/B Extra Bass Bluetooth Headphones, Black. Note; I tested using wired mode, not wireless mode.

Sound is pretty good.
- Beats Solo2 Wireless had better clarity and a little less bass.
- Sony MDRXB650BT/B had much more bass.

Comfort is OK but applies too much pressure to allow long periods wearing them.
- Beats are lightest and most comfortable of the 3.
- Sony are light enough and have a circular rather than oval ear cup, which may be useful for some listeners.

Controls are fine. (Sorry, can't remember control comparison between this and the Beats and Sony.)

Mpow usability on calls is mixed. Bluetooth mode had too much breakup. Wired mode worked fine. Watch your voice level, as these over-the-ear headphones could easily make you a loud talker.

Good purchase, good customer service!

I did quite a bit of research trying to find a decent over-the-ear budget bluetooth headphone. I settled on the Mpow 059. I purchased the silver model, and they arrived in two days with Amazon Prime shipping.

I really wanted to like these headphones. They looked good out of the box, fit nicely on my head, and seemed pretty comfortable. The one issue I noted right away was how much sound leaked out of the headphones. I wanted to use them in an office environment, but to be honest, even at modest sound levels, the sound that leaked out would likely bother those sitting close to me. At the very least, even if they weren't bothered, they'd know what I was listening to.  That was strike one.

The other issue I discovered was that there was no way to ""pause"" the music, which I would need to do when a co-worker approached, or to talk to others in the office.  The instructions say there is a ""Pause"" feature, and there even seems to be an icon to ""pause"" on the headset controls, but no matter what I tried I could not get the music to pause. So, I either had to turn the volumn all the way down, or turn off the headset, if I wanted to talk to a co-worker. Neither of these was an accepable option for me. So, being defective, I will be returning them.  Time to find a second choice for a good, budget, headphone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Ear buds were almost completely useless and I started looking for a set of noise cancelling earphones as soon as I got home.  I'm happy to say that these made my second trip much better.  These aren't miracle earphones, I was still aware that I was on an airplane, but I was able to listen to gentile meditation and relaxation music on the plane and I only heard a slight buzzing in the background from the plane engines.  When I took the headphones off the talk to the attendant, I was amazed how loud the plane cabin was outside these headphones.  They cut out a good 90% of the noise.
They are comfortable enough for me, and the folding feature was handy.  They easily fit into my purse while going through airport security.  You'll need to read the instructions to get the hang of the controls.  Pretty much, you just hold down the power button until it turns on and pairs, and hold it again to turn off.  I can't speak to the phone features, I'm only interested in using these as traditional headphones.

Sound quality is much better than my last similarly priced wired headphones, I'm not an expert in sound quality but personally I don't find flaws at all.
Microphone is amazing! I'm not even sure where it's located, but sound quality is great over skype.

so it's really 10/10 considering the price point.

there's two minor issues, that hardly worth mentioning:

- There's an option to connect to 2 devices simultaneously but it's not working well if you listening to music on your phone and browsing internet on your connected desktop AT THE SAME TIME. In other words if you listen to one device with another one occasionally activating.. well sound quality will noticeably drop when both devices playing sounds.

- If you don't listen to constant stream of sounds for a while they have activation delay maybe half a second or so. It's a very specific issue that not everyone will notice. Gamers, music listeners, movie watchers won't notice it. But if you doing exercises at khan academy, that ""completed"" sound will play with delay each time, unless you listen to some music also.

Recommended.","June 6, 2019","I like these headphones. Comfortable ear cups/pads and long battery life are what I like best. When fully charged I can wear these all day and have never had battery die or need recharging in a single, very long day of travel. I have had a couple times where they disconnected from devices repeatedly, but generally they work well and look good.
I use these for listening to music or books on the plane and they do blockout most ambient noise and neighbors conversation when playing.  While wearing these when turned off they dont really cancel much noise.
The bar between the two-ear cups is not padded and could more be comfortable, but compared to the popular, high dollar sets I see everywhere, I am happy with this purchase and recommend.
I have bought a couple of other over ear, wireless headphones in this price range and these are by far the best of that group!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

As my son is well into his teens we have many discussions about phone and sound technology.  He’s used his hard earned money to by more than a few expensive ear buds and headphones.  Although his big brand headphones sound good I would expect much more for the price he’s paid. I just don’t buy into the brand hype and headphones or ear buds that cost hundreds of dollars. Especially when you can find a pair of headphones like this that get the job done for much less.  These work just fine for the average listener.  That said, there a few things lacking. There’s no tone or bass adjustment. And the music apps don’t usually allow you to adjust either. Nor does the phone itself. I grew up in the age of multi-piece stereo equipment.  I had a dedicated equalizer on my stereo.  I don’t understand why these phones and music apps don’t allow you to custom equalize your music.  You would think this could easily be created digitally.  But just a simple treble and bass button would help. Sometimes the music sounds muffled.  I contacted tech support to ask if I was missing something about how to adjust the treble/bass.  The support person replied by asking me to reboot and re-pair the headphones.  Ugh. A replied by asking the question again and they finally replied with the simple answer which was “no” you cannot adjust tone on the unit.  So points off for that.  The other issue I have is response of the buttons.  They’re very slow to respond. Sometimes they don’t respond at all and I have to use the controls on the phone or laptop I’m paired with.  Battery life seems well though.  I have used them for more than a few hours at a time and have not received that low battery warning you get from small wireless buds.  Overall good value for the money. If your the average person who just wants to listen to their music collection or TV programs these work fine. If your an audiophile like my son I’m sure you’ll find some reason to spend $$$$ on some big brand headphones instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However there is one glaring problem. The control is on the right earphone. It is very difficult to see the indicators such as up down right left. If you hold it just right and the light hits it you can figure out what the indicators are. But that would mean taking the headphones off to do even the simplest thing such as changing the volume.  The little booklet that came with the headphones is tiny. The print is barely readable with a magnifying glass. I went online to their website to find an online version of the instructions. I couldn't find that. But the website shows a different headset with a much more intuitive set of controls on off, volume increase and decrease. When you are wearing the headphones, it is very difficult to increase or decrease volume, or do other functions. Because the wheel that does everything has no tactile points to tell where you are. You are left to struggle with the tiny book with the tiny font. Too bad. If it weren't for this I would love these headphones. I want the one on their website.

Husband can't hear and TV always blaring. He wears these and peace is reestablished. Sound with Samsung TV is great! I wear these while exercising on the treadmill  and using my iPad. Sound quality is great.  Have even tried them with my Samsung phone in the car while husband is driving (of course).....again, great sound. We have a 2300 square foot home, and I can wear these all over the house still connected and great sound. They connected easily to all devices (tv, iPad, phone). No delay when viewing TV or video. Ear fits within the cushions of the headset which are very roomy and soft.  I have worn them for about 2 hours without head or ears hurting. You can still hear around you with these on, but the sound level is very soft. I like the controls on the side, does take a bit getting use to.  Instruction book is not really helpful for the controls.  It is sorta trial and error in figuring out if the headset is on or off, paired or connected. Just a new toy and you have to get use to it.  I read many of the reviews before purchasing and was most impressed with Patozon Customer Service courteous and prompt reply. One draw back is when my husband is wearing the headset and watching TV, I can not hear the TV, or video, or movie playing.

Since we bought them waaaay early for Christmas, return period was over after we realized he didn't want them.  So I decided to keep them.  I'm glad I did.  These stay on my home office desk for when I need a little quiet to focus.
Pros:
- Comfy for about an hour, the cups could be a little deeper, but maybe my ears just stick out more
- Battery life, are you serious, I charged them Christmas day, and use them daily for 20 minutes or so, they're still rocking that initial charge.  Seller says 20 hours, seems like more though.
- Dampens surrounding noise.  Not active noise cancelling, but does a good job of getting the environment out and music through.
- Foldable.  I guess this is a Pro, I have no real need to fold them, but I do travel alot, so maybe it'll make them a little more resilient to ""packing"".
- Can plug an audio cable in and use like standard headphones, no charge needed.

Cons:
- Ear cups a little shallow for my ears.  After about an hour of wear, they tend to get uncomfortable.  Again, maybe jst my ears.
- Off Switch.  To power off, you have to hold the center function button for several seconds, and go through first, unpairing, then power off.  Clearly not a deal breaker, but wish it was a more direct power off, maybe a double tap of that button instead of holding.
- Builtin Mic wasn't the greatest, at least according to my son when we skyped, but it's builtin to the right ear cup, so not best position, BUT, they're cordless, so no other option.

I wouldn't hesitate to add another pair to my household if someone wanted headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I loved the flexibility of being able to walk around uninterrupted while I'm working but they are so tight that after about an hour I can't stand it squeezing on my ears. My ears look red from the pressure,  I'm looking to find something more comfortable that I can wear for longer than an hour at a time.

Revised (New) Feedback: This newer model is more comfortable than the first one that I had.  It does not squeeze so tightly onto my ears, but I wish the adjustable slides could slide just a little more, I feel like they hang a little too low, not right up onto my ears as I would ideally want them to be.  They feel like they get a little sweaty, which the first ones did not do.

Bottom line, both models have their pros and cons, but the newer one feels better for longer periods of time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I bought these in Dec 2017 and they are still great in April 2019.

So, so great! The sound is actually pretty good too, very balanced and makes some of the songs I've listened to over and over again become exciting and invigorating again. I never knew I'd been missing out on some subtle nuances from some of my favorite tracks all this time, since I've been too cheap to buy a $300-plus set online without experiencing them first hand. Hands down, these headphones sound very good.

My issue with them is that if I'm listening to Queen on a bus at just a medium volume, everyone in a 10 foot radius would be able to sing along to the lyrics. I know, it sounds like a good problem to have. But seriously, the sound leakage is insane and really defeats the purpose of wearing earphones in the first place. I feel very uncomfortable wearing these out in public because even the constant ambient noise you hear in any coffee shop or gym doesn't drown out whatever you might be listening to. Everyone can hear your Bieber playlist. And they ARE judging you.

If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, then buy the hell out of these. The look fantastic and are easy to pair with your devices, and despite it's flaws I don't regret buying these heaphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Over the past few years I’d been using Beat solos. They had amazing sound but were on-ear and wired; so when I got the iPhone 8, I had to use the aux to lightning adapter. Let’s just say that being wired was a pain enough but having to use the adapter was an extra struggle... Anyways, I did a ton of research and just didn’t want to throw down $200-$300 for wireless beats, especially since the over-ear ones cost even more. Coming on Amazon, I noticed the 16,000+ reviews for the Mpows and compared both the reviews and descriptions to other well-rated headphones on here. I asked for them for my birthday and wasn’t disappointed.

The sound quality is pretty great although I wouldn’t say perfect. As for the volume, I at first found it funny that the volume on the headphones is different from the volume on your phone (you have to turn the phone volume up THEN turn the headphone volume up or down). However, I actually like that as it helps me make sure the headphones aren’t on full blast when I put them on.

I’m thrilled with the over-ear fit; for my ears it truly is over-ear and I’d say my ears are average size. They’re also comfortable to wear with glasses/sunglasses. The overall comfort when wearing them is great! Headband is comfortable, earpads are comfortable, etc. While they are adjustable, I personally don’t need to adjust the headband for my fit.

I have yet to try them wired, but that’s because a) I’d only ever use that if the batteries died and b) the battery is so freaking long I’ve yet to drain it in full! I charge them every night and also make sure to turn them off and charge them whenever they’re not in use.

The drawstring bag they come with is nice quality, but I still wish they came with a hardcase instead. My Beats came with a softcase and even that wasn’t heavy duty enough in my taste. I’m definitely not going to just throw them in my bags when I travel.

The Bluetooth pairing is easy as pie! I was able to quickly pair with my iPhone and now it connects automatically whenever I turn Mpow on. It also tells me the battery percentage with a little headphone icon next to my phone’s battery in the notification bar. Although I wish it would also say it in the control panel like airpods do, I’m happy to know the battery percentage at all.

There is only one flaw that I find with these headphones. As someone who travels often and has to share bedrooms, it drives me crazy that when they are on the Bluetooth Indicator flashes every 6 seconds. I can’t see it unless I’m in front of a mirror or in a dark room, but I know that when I’m sharing a room at night, and my roommates are trying to sleep, it’ll piss them off. I’m going to have to put a post-it note or non-damaging tape over the control buttons to diffuse the bright, blinking lights. While it makes sense for the indicator lights to flash when you’re holding the headphones in your hand turning them on, off, or pairing them, it makes absolutely NO SENSE why there should be lights whilst you can’t even see them while they’re on your head. Plus, everyone knows blue light is the worst at night; it tends to light up a room more and keep you awake. This really frustrates me when I’m planning to use these late at night...

Overall,

I really do love these headphones.

Great quality
Great price

Long-lasting battery

The book has 9 pages and it is about half English and half French.  I read in other reviews to be careful about polarity when charging these headphones from a wall outlet.

Very comfortable, cool looking, and easy to use. A single charge seems to last about 12 hours of continuous use - but since I don't use mine continuously, I can get about a week of intermittent use out of them.

You need to install the headphone drivers, and make sure your device is bluetooth enabled. My computer didn't have bluetooth, so I purchased a USB 4.0 bluetooth transmitter. There's a moment where the headset syncs with the computer, then you get sound through the headphones.

If you're going from wired to wireless sound, the audio quality is really good - there's some very minor static or feedback (very minor) so I noticed it wasn't the same as wired quality, but nothing that really bothered me for long.

Overall, I really like this as a replacement for my wired headset - no cords is a HUGE improvement, the cord kept getting caught on my arm or chair, and moving my chair the rollers would often roll over the wire... which was bad.

They look super nice, quality seem sturdy (well made), and the fit is extreamly comfortable (I have yet to try them out at the gym, and wear them for a longer period of time), not to loose or tight. The sound is perfect for my use, meaning great quality for the gym (for super music enthusiast, I would go with more expensive brand). It would be nice if the volume could go a little higher, you will not get anything loud here, but the sound is good. Paring with both my Samsung S4 phone, and IPad 2 was very easy, as was charging. Walked 10meters away from my phone, and the music was still perfect. The sound is the same quality, wheather Bluetooth or direct cable connect. Next I need to pair it with my LG TV, hopefully that will go as smooth as everything else.
All in all, I will recommend these headphones, they fold up easily, very comfortable and good sound, all for about $35.00.
UPDATE: I have used the headphones at the gym, and they are truly comfortable, have had them on for 2 hours without a problem, almost forgot I had them on.

I had been scouring the internet for so long looking for great headphones that wouldn't cost me hundreds of dollars. Then I found these MPOW headphones! I was skeptical at first because the price was just too good to be true, but I decided to try them anyways. And I am so glad that I did. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.

Comfort - Great 8/10
Noise Isolating - Fantastic 9/10
Sound Quality - Amazing 10/10

* These headphones are comfortable and the earmuff padding fits well over my ears. The only times they are uncomfortable are when I'm trying to lay on my side, but that's a personal problem. They're perfectly comfortable when laying on my back or sitting up. The adjustable headband is soft and does not cause me any pain at the top of my head.
* They are also great at blocking out external sounds. My friends and roommates often have to wave at me before I realize they were trying to get my attention. Or they say my name repeatedly in increasing volume, then I'll hear them...eventually. They do not cancel out sounds, but they are great at dulling out external sounds.
* The sounds quality is great, it keeps the sound crisp, and the volume gets pretty loud. I have such a struggle listening to anything on my laptop (it's old) and even when I have the volume at 100% the a/c drowns it out. But these headphones are so great that I can lower my volume to 50% and it will be more than loud enough.
* The option to have them be wireless or wired is also a plus for me. It was not something I had considered, but I'm glad it's an option. My laptop does not have a Bluetooth function (something I didn't even notice until I got these headphones), so when using my laptop I keep them plugged in but when using my phone I am wireless and free.
* I know that there are newer models of these headphones (I don't doubt that those are all great based on the quality of these) but this version is the most recent one that comes in various colors. Which I loved because I got to pick my preferred color. And when I bought a pair for my brother I was able to get them in his favorite color.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The only reason I’m not giving one star is because these things were inexpensive, so sometimes you get what you pay for. I regret this purchase. The sound quality is very weak. I can barely hear the bass compared to other headphones I own that are the same price range. I even have some cheap earbuds that are way better sounding with deeper bass. I am disappointed also with how uncomfortable these are. I can only wear them for about 30 minutes and I have to take them off. They push in really hard and feel really tight on my ears. I guess that would be a good thing if you were outside jogging or doing yardwork or something, because they will definitely not come off easily. Otherwise they are just painful after about a half hour. And also the make myvests super HOT. It feels like they’re on fire. So, pain AND hotness  SO uncomfortable. My old Avantree Bluetooth headphones are much more comfortable, eats don’t get hot, and the sound quality is twice as good (especially the bass) — and I paid about the same for them. If I had more time on my hands I would return these for a refund but I don’t. I guess I’m just going to continue listening to my old headphones. Maybe I will keep these as a backup pair but I do not recommend buying these. On the plus side, they do fold up, which most other over the ear Bluetooth headphones do not. So they go in a smaller case. I also bought the case. Other than that, I would not recommend. I guess I can’t hit a homerun with everything I purchase on Amazon. Oh well. Onward and upward. *** UPDATE ***  The name back to her contacted me via email after I posted this initial or review. They sent me a new pair of headphones in the mail, but they are different model altogether. They look even cheaper than my original ones. But the sound quality is a lot better. So kudos to the manufacturer  for doing that. I changed my rating from two stars to three stars on that basis.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Get bangin!!!!!","December 7, 2017","Not going to lie... i only bought these to hold me off till Corsair makes a better version of the VOID with TRUE surround sound but it turns out these headphones are freaking amazing!! The price, style, colors and comfort are all a grand slam. The battery on this thing is fantastic and it baby sips on the juice. If i had to be critical of these and i don't want to be but i'd have to say the fact the headphones don't twist forwards like all the rest of the traditional headphones. These do fold into a more smaller and portable size which is great but i don't know... I'm really stretching here guys.

Very happy with my purchase, Thank you Mpow. I'll gladly buy another pair from you guys.

UPDATE: I realized there is no pictures in the reviews for the blue headphones. Maybe these might help... i guess.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

One thing that really impressed me about them was how long they could hold a charge. I haven't kept track exactly, but they've easily lasted me 15+ hours on Bluetooth. Maybe that battery life will decrease over time, I don't know, but for right now, that longevity is incredible. When I first got them, they felt a little tight on my head, but they've loosened up a lot, while still staying securely around your ears so they don't fall off and people around you don't hear your music. A couple of things I don't like about these headphones...one, there is this British voice that talks every time you turn them on, turn them off, pair with the computer, etc. While I do think this is helpful to let people know when these connections are made, I wish there was a way to disable it, or at least make the notification a beep instead of a voice. It's getting really annoying to hear that lady's voice every time I turn them on. Second, these have almost NO bass.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Very comfortable.","February 23, 2018","Surprisingly comfortable with surprisingly good sound quality. Compact and ergonomic, easily adjust to your head. Every thing you need is included except a dongle for blue tooth enabling (bought separately). Also easy to use with the audio and USB charging cables included. Note the cables are a bit short so if planning to use as a hardwired item, you'll want longer cables, especially for audio. Audio cable is about 4 foot long which limits distance from the audio device. Controls are nicely built into the ear piece (muff) and control on/off, volume and blue tooth link mode. A clear voice lets you know when you turn them on or off as well as let's you know if your blue tooth link is good. Right now we're using these with a desktop PC, Windows 10. Windows recognized the blue tooth connection immediately and set up the link without having to use any extra software or downloading any drivers. A fantastic value, I'd buy them again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

My first impressions are that they sure feel nice to the touch. The soft faux leather padding on the head and and ear pads feels literally like baby skin, no joke. The plastic feels like thin plastic but the price point helps overlook that. So far the sound is just okay, the mids and highs are mediocre and the bass is over exaggerated. I bought these for the gym because my in ear buds and over ear buds have a tendency to not sit right in my ear regardless of the plug size. I'm hopeful these will be comfortable enough and not bug me with my glasses while working out. I tend to just use them while lifting weights and some light cardio so I expect them to stay in place. The pressure on my ears with glasses is good but the headband feels like it might be too much pressure and could use more thick padding. The noise isolation is what can be expected for over ear headphones. One issue I noticed already is that music bleeds out the headphones while listening at 2/3-3/4 max volume when listening to hip hop and even classical music. If it matters I have an s9+ with adapt sound set to music and my EQ is set to rock with middle bass and second to last vocal dial. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. Hope they last long as most negative reviews complain of longevity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I purchased these for my 9yr old son who’s pretty hard on most anything.

I decided to purchase these base on the reviews here on amazon.

Out of the box the build quality is decent, I’m not sure how long they will hold up but their built better than other cheap brands on amazon. The headphone came with a charge and powered up with no issue. When it came to pairing they paired quickly and had no issues. The headphones have control on the right ear piece and all function properly. They can with a audio cable, charging cable and a storage bag I find that nice like high end brands I personally use.

Now the sound. These are low powered speakers. Sound is lackluster at best. They sound fairly mono tone. No crisp highs, no full deeps lows and their not very loud. With that they serve their purpose and work well for my son, where sound quality isn’t as important as the coolness of Bluetooth headphones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was contacted by customer support because of the review I left (can be read below)-they said I was still within warranty and sent a replacement! Thanks to them, I do not have this problem now, and their customer support is amazing!

Like others, after a little while the foam pad started to come off. Though, they may mean the entire pad, I do not. My phone pad is ""shedding"". There are little black particles coming from the foam pads, which get everywhere-almost as bad as glitter. It is unfortunate, because I really liked the headphones while they lasted. These black particles are so annoying that I cannot use them anymore, and from what I hear there are no replacement pads. My only choice now is to purchase another headset elsewhere in hopes I do not run into this issue again.

I only leave honest reviews, and feel bad that it came out this way--they were great in the beginning and still work, its just the foam pads are terrible. If they have a model that fixes this and is the same otherwise, I would recommend it for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Great customer service. The new pair is definitely a welcome improvement over the pair in my initial review. The sound is less muffled, bass is deeper and more solid. I don’t hear as much “boom” as I did with the previous pair, suggesting that MPOW has resolved that issue. The new pair arrived in a lovely white box, a welcomed improvement over the original. I hope this new pair lasts much longer but only time will tell. Until then, thank you MPOW!

UPDATE: After less than a year of ownership, the structural integrity of these headphones has begun to degrade. The leatherette covering, present on the ear cushions has begun to flake. Cracks have also begun to develop in the headband. These headphones have been used lightly and have been well cared for; these are factors to consider when purchasing these headphones.

Original Review: Great Pair of Bluetooth Headphones for the Price: As a certified audio professional who mainly listens to and composes rock music, I can say that at this price point you are not going to get Sennheiser, Bose or Beats audio quality out-of-the-box. However, for the price these are useable headphones that are more than capable of providing decent audio quality (once the right adjustments are made). They require a bit of frequency gain reduction between 60-250Hz to reduce boom and a boost at around 16kHz to establish clarity. Once you’ve done that you’ll have a more balanced sound from these headphones.

The bluetooth volume controls, and battery status bar indicators of these headphones are natively supported on Android (but not on macOS.) In other words when you adjust the volume on your headphones it will directly adjust the volume control on your Android device. On the Mac the headphone’s volume is independent of macOS. Play/Pause and Skip buttons work natively on both platforms.

There are no latency issues when watching video. Lips move in sync with audio.

The MPOW 059 supports the SBC audio codec exclusively, which means no AAC or AptX is present. It would have been great to see support for AAC seeing as it is a superior codec to SBC but nonetheless sound quality is reasonable.

macOS users will need to download the “Hardware IO Tools for Xcode” from Apple’s developer page in order to get the “Bluetooth Explorer” application. This application will allow you to increase the bitpool value from its default value of 40 to 53. This will dramatically improve the audio quality of these headphones and any other bluetooth headphones that rely solely on the SBC codec. For those who want specifics: a bit pool value of 53 is equal to a bitrate of 325 kbps. SBC at 325 kbps is the equivalent of MP3 at 256 kbps. When the you’ve downloaded “Hardware IO Tools for Xcode”  and have opened the Bluetooth Explorer app you will see the app’s name in your menubar. Go to “Tools > Audio Options” or “Command + Shift + A”. This will bring up the window for you to edit the SBC audio settings. Under “SBC Codec Options” Set all bitpool values to 53 and close the window. This will ensure that the audio quality remains optimal. Close the window and re-connect your Bluetooth headphones.

Build quality seems reasonable, hinges are reinforced with metal. Only time will demonstrate the endurance of these headphones but superficially speaking the headphones appear to be quite sturdy. The ear-cups and headband are made of a soft synthetic leather which provides initial comfort but they are a bit shallow in depth and can place a bit of pressure on the ears when the headset is worn for an extended period of time. Battery life is reasonable. Accessories include a micro-usb cable for charging and a 3.5 mm audio cable which is handy for more critical listening and for events in which the battery has lost its charge. The velvet-like pouch is a great inclusion and provides protection against dust and scratches. These headphones are definitely worth the price and I doubt you’ll find better at this price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I originally ordered 3 pair for my kids (black/red, black/blue, silver) about 2 years ago. They have gotten so many hours of use and abuse and have really held up!

Recently I just replaced the black/red pair for my youngest child who uses them way more hours a day than would be considered healthy... try not to judge my parenting. He’s very abusive to the headphones, he apparently thinks they are indestructible, they have gone hard down a flight of stairs countless times, been thrown across the room but they just kept going, until we assume a wire eventually broke bc one side stopped working and thus the reordered pair. But you need to know the other two pair that are used in a much more conventional way with less abuse are still in perfect working condition!!!

My son also has a pair of  $100 fancy gamer headphones (name brand) and he says his Mpow headphones are better and more comfortable, and greatly prefers the Mpow set.

I’ve borrowed the different pairs from my kids several times and I agree, very comfy even when listening to a long book over many hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Memory-Protein/product-reviews/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
