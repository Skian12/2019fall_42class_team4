Only had them for a few hours but in very impressed with sound quality, volume, and comfort. And they look pretty cool. But the wood is not what I ordered. That's not a huge deal because I almost went with this color anyway. I was worried when I put them on because the earpads are just about as small as I could ever want them. Almost on ear size. But they do fit around my ear perfectly and are in fact VERY comfortable even with a hat or glasses. Tight fit but not too much pressure.
They feel a little cheaper than I had hoped but nonetheless very sturdy and I'm pretty clumsy so we'll see how they hold up. Again, the amazing sound quality out of the box completely made up for all that. I've read they don't sound good until the drivers are broken in a bit but I love the sound and can't wait to hear it improve with use. Plus the charging cable and aux cord are pretty nice. And a cool carrying bag I'm never gonna use. I'll up it to 4 stars if I'm still happy in a week.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I had tried to turn up the volume on the headset, and when I did, they went to maximum volume. I took a look at the button, and it was sunk in to the casing. It's not like I had pressed hard, so I was a little surprised. Then, after I had turned them off, they would no longer pair with any devices. I tried to contact the manufacturer since I had just bought them, but Amazon wouldn't touch them. I contacted the manufacturer, and their idea was that I send them the headphones on my $$ for them to repair, or replace with a re-manufactured pair. I explained that this was not O.K, but as according to Olivia at Syphonized (or whatever company is selling them), ""it's our policy"".

I wouldn't waste my time with this product, it's too much money to throw away since you might end up with a used pair to replace your > 1 month old pair.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Pull the foam out though (PICTURES)","February 2, 2017","These headphones are an amazing value! They have style and GREAT deep sound. The wood definitely creates a better sound than I have ever heard before. The drums have that mid-bass ""snap"" that you can feel in person and usually miss out on with headphones at this price. Bass guitars sound like they are meant to in these headphones.

I agree with most that they sound slightly muddy at first, but they get better as the driver gets worked. I found what the other reviewer said to be true with the highs being slightly muffled, and I did the same thing he did and removed the foam. Now they sound even better. It was a very simple thing to do, only took me 5 minutes. Don't worry the cloth with the ""L"" & ""R"" is attached to the ear pads, so they will look the exact same as before. See photos.

All around these headphones are very solid and look like they are much more high end than the price payed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

PROS:
- I put the most important part in the headline, but just to be clear: I've tried at least five different kinds of headphones on my Pixel 2 and these have the best call quality hands down.  I emailed Symphonized customer service to ask about this before I bought them and they confirmed there was a high call quality.  But, when I got them I called two different people to test it; one said that it's the best they've heard from any device/microphone I've used.  I tested the sound quality by leaving the phone in one room and walking around and it never dipped.  I can't tell you how amazing this is.  I've tried Skullcandy wireles earbuds, Ankers and a couple different wired options with the adapter and these blew them out of the water.  They really are great for phone calls.
- The build quality is incredible.  They are lightweight but weighty enough to feel solid.  Wore them for a few hours last night with no problems.
- The sound quality is fantastic, but it takes some tooling around with your device to get it correct.  I played around with the EQ on different apps to get a level for music and a level for podcasts/YouTube vids.  As a caveat here, I've never had any other over the ear bluetooth headphones, only earbuds, so I can't speak to how they compare to other wireless headphones.  However, I've had dozens of pairs of wired headphones at a comparable price and these blow them out of the water, you just need to be patient and figure out the right settings.
- Included in the box are two cables, one for charging and one 3.5mm cable to connect to a headphone port.  The cables are very high quality.

CONS:
- There is no manual anywhere that I could find.  I got a couple of small pieces of paper to remind me to rate on Amazon and that was about it.  I couldn't find one on the site either. The issues below are most likely solved by understanding how they work, so I'd give them a pass with a manual.
- There is a strange beep when you switch tracks using the headphones.  It also has a separate beep when you turn them off from the normal Bluetooth audio cues.  I don't mind it in theory, but it would be nice to be able to remove it.
- The buttons on the headset are very responsive, but the setup is kind of strange.  There are three buttons: +,-, and a power button.  You hold down the +/- for volume or click it once for track switch.  This is a great idea in theory, in practice, it doesn't always work that well.  I've switched tracks trying to turn the volume up a couple of times.  Also, the power button acts as the Google assistant/siri call button.  I haven't figured out exactly how that works yet, but I think you have to hold it down for a second for it to work.  The problem is, you hold it down longer and it turns the headphones off.
- Kind of a minor one, but I didn't realize it until after I bought them: the cups don't fold down.  Not a big deal, but I'd have liked that option for travel.
- Battery life doesn't seem to display accurately on my phone.  This is most likely a bluetooth/pixel 2 issue but it's very bizarre.  It went from 80% to beeping a few minutes later.  Again, probably not an issue with the headphones but without a manual I can't tell.

In any case, these are everything I wanted at this price point, if for nothing else the incredible build quality and style.  They are so much nicer than the Skullcandy, Jabra and others I tried on.  These are a definite buy, and I may even grab a set of their wireless earbuds as well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was totally expecting these to be absolutely awful, but I'm totally blown away.  I'm a bit of a stickler for audio quality.  But lately, I've been getting a bit fatigued from wired headphones on the train every morning/evening.  Chords getting snagged on things and ripping headphones/earbuds off my head was getting incredibly annoying.  I guess I'll go over pro's and con's and then give comparisons and impressions of audio quality.

Pros:
1.  No cord.  Holy F@#%.  Opening a door only to have your earbuds ripped from your ears.  How can something so small be so infuriating.  No more!
2.  Style.  Damn, these things look good.  I've never been one to buy headphones for looks, but damn do these look nice in every way.
3.  Comfort.  Ok, let's get this out of the way.  NO, they are not fully over ear in the way the a pair of 598s fit over your ear.  But I'm hardly going to dock them for not comparing to the most comfortable cans ever made.  That said, they fit cleanly enough over my goober ears.  I mean, I'm not an elephant but my ears rather tall and these fit over them pretty well.  So even though they're not perfectly over ear, they are still very comfortable.  A lot of this has to do with a somewhat loose fit, decently soft pads, and extremely light weight.  This could be a con to you though, if you have a small head.  They may be a bit too loose, but for me, it's a perfect clamp.
4.  Build strength.  Notice I didn't say build quality?  Yeah we'll get to that in the next section!  The metal feels strong, the wood feels fine, and the small amount of plastic that is on it, doesn't feel thin.  The pads are also decent quality.
5.  Last but definitely not least, AUDIO QUALITY!!!  There pretty good.  Honestly, I bought these mostly to get rid of having a cord when I'm out walking around.  The bass and mids are muddy, but that may fix itself as they get used since it's not too terrible.  The highs seemed almost nonexistent until I took off the foam covering the drivers.  Man it sounds so much better.  The highs are pretty accurate, and not overbearing at all.  I personally used a small equilizer app on my phone to fix the mids and bass and honestly, it did a world of good.  If you know how to use an EQ, download one of the free apps and use it to fix audio quality.  It's totally worth doing.  Makes these cans sound great.

Cons:
1.  Build quality.  Honestly, it could be since there is a ton of metal, but you can hold these by the head straps and jingle them like keys.  It sounds like EVERYTHING is loose on the metal bits.  I'm almost positive that it's not going to break, but having rattling headphones is very weird.  I've never had this issue before.  It feels worse than I think it actually is.  Also worth noting that they don't rattle once they're on my head, so I'm not listening to jingling when I walk around.  That's most important to me.  I think they're built strong, but rattling doesn't instill much confidence.
2.  Audio Quality.  Honestly, I'm sure they'll burn in and I'll get used to them.  But it's kind of hard ditching good headphones for these, as the sound quality doesn't match up to even the cheapest hi-fi/mid-fi headphones.  Oh well, it's a sacrifice I'm willing to take in order to get around that dang cord while I'm out.

Honestly, these are killer cans with a little modding needed (removing foam from behind pads and using an EQ to fix muddy audio).  You probably won't find better bluetooth headphones under $200.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.  And that's rare, because I'm a huge whiner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

So more than a month ago, I purchased these wireless headphones after extensively researching for a high quality, reasonably priced, good looking headphones. I ended up with these and am totally psyched! They work beautifully, sound wonderful, and even survived a full wash in the washing machine.

How could this happen? Well, I'm an over the road trucker & a poker player so after traveling, it's convenient to throw everything into my laundry bag, then remove it when I get home. We'll, somehow I missed the headphones, dumped my clothes & the headphones into the washer, did a full load & my wife brought them to me. She said, ""sorry they got washed but we can replace them"". I said, get the hair dryer. After drying them 2 times for 15-30 minutes each time, I hung them up for 3 full days. Just today for the first time, I turned the headphones on & they work perfectly!

I was looking for something to use at work, and I can tell these would drive me crazy to wear for 8 hours a day. It`s a shame, as the cups felt good against my head, much less sound leakage than Hesh2.

I have since returned these in favor of the Skullcandy Grind Bluetooth edition; I already own the regular wired one and it actually has much cleaner bass response than the Wraith 2.0, which tended to sound kinda muddy at points.

I do also want to mention this because I've seen other people say the same, I had ordered the Zebra ones and they looked more like the walnut. No indication on the packaging as to which they were supposed to be. The metal also constantly caught and pulled my hair, so not the most comfortable. Wouldn't recommend these headphones.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The low and mids were very muddy. I listened to a variety of different music to see if there was a change. Then I went to the EQ on my iPhone and began playing around. I put it on bass reduction and that was the silver bullet. Everything now sounds sharp, slightly muddled on some music but overall great sound.

That said, I returned these immediately. The claim of noise isolation is wrong. you can hear everything around you almost the same as when you lift them away from your ears. They are also tiny. I am a grown man with normal sized features and it looked like I stole some childs headphones. Sad day. The build quality is also poor. The buttons rattle around in their sockets. This sound also transfers inside to your ear. I love the wood and metal, but the silver ring around the wood is plastic. Round cushions don't cover my ears. My lobes were visible in the mirror.

I would happily pay $100 more for this if it were the right size, covered my ears, isolated the noise so I could use on plane, and was build a little better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Music has a strong and full sound, but seems to be somehow muffled.

I was told no, not if they are out of warranty.  They suggested I find an aftermarket replacement, but gave me no guidance on the size to buy, etc.  I found a pair of Audio Technica ATH-D40s that were in a box in my closet and I was amazed at their improvement of clarity vs the Wraith's.

That being said, I have, however, owned many headphones, I including studio quality. The sound quality for these is slightly higher than those of iPhone quality earbuds (except over your ear instead of in it), and lower than the S8+ earbuds (I'm using earbuds as a gauge because they are more widely accessible). I would also like to include that these stank greatly out of the box.

Vocals are clear, but background music is sometimes distorted, both wirelessly and corded. While testing, I found that indie, alternative, pop, and rock suffered. Bands like Meg Myers, Transviolet, and Melanie Martinez suffer- nuances lost, sounding flat.

Unacceptable is the lack of justice for run of the mill greats like Dinah Washington, Armstrong, Sinatra, etc. Ironically, these ""orchestra"" oriented headphones do the least for jazz, ragtime, big band, and oldies.

Hip-hop, rap, and country do fine. It should be noted that I am most likely prejudice for these genres and would probably think they sounded the same through a tin can. Sorry.

Techno (and all sound categories in the same vein) are not immersive.

Overall, these are acceptable for the double sale I got these under (~$55), but if I had paid the original price, the return label would already be slapped on them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Very small and not over-ear.","May 15, 2018","Definitely not worth $75, for starters. I got them for $60 and they aren't worth that either. I was so excited to get these but honestly I'm just so disappointed now. They're nothing like what you'd expect.

They're absolutely not ""over-ear headphones"" either. They're larger than on-ear headphones but these just simply do not go around your ear and they aren't designed to. The ear cups are extremely shallow so it's clear they are meant to rest on your ears, just on the edges. Not around them, not even close.

The build quality is average at best. The chrome bits around the earcups are all plastic and the rotating mechanism is extremely rattly and shakey, and makes tons of noise. I can shake them gently and they will function as well as maracas.

It feels fragile even though it seems to be made of metal. The wood looks fine and I'm sure it's just an inlay, but it looks good either way.

The sound quality is just... ugh. It would be fine for bassheads who don't actually care about the lyrics in the songs, but this is literally just... endless bass so muddy I honestly can barely understand my own favorite songs. I read tons of reviews of these and I'm not sure how anyone thought the sound quality of these were any good at all. I boosted the treble on my phone's EQ to max and it still sounds awfully muddy. I'm not sure what they were thinking when they made these. There is absolutely no clarity whatsoever, it's very disappointing.

Comfort is fine for ON-ear headphones. The cushions on the headband and earcups are very soft.

The entire thing is much smaller than you'd expect and very light. As for looks, I honestly love them. They look amazing. It's a shame they sound awful for $75 headphones. I'll be returning them, thank god I bought the ones fulfilled by amazon because Ive heard this company does not handle CS well at all.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These look more like the Walnut ones. I can't confirm nor deny that they are actually the Zebra 'color' (pattern, really)  because there is nothing on the packaging that indicates it either way. Plus the Walnut pattern still does not look like the ones I actually received, so who knows. Perhaps the patterns of the wood vary, however this is a completely different look. It took some time to realize the tiny little instruction pamphlet was inside the bag that comes with it. I thought they were missing. I googled all around and had to read through a bunch of comments before I learned how to pair them. Eventually, I found the instructions in the burlap sack that comes with them. An unusual place for the instructions when usually those would be found in the box directly. I guess the assumption is that the buyer will immediately look INSIDE of what appears to be an empty sack for the almost invisible instructions (because they are literally just a tiny folded paper).

Other than that, they are very comfortable and the sound is pretty decent. They come with a cute burlap pouch to put them in for carry. I like that they can be used both with and without wires. Haven't tried a call on them yet, so not sure of the quality or the wireless mic. Still, I'm thinking of sending them back because I want the Zebra look I paid extra for.... maybe I will keep them though. If so, after I have used them if I love them I will up the stars, but it will never be 5 because, despite them being pretty good looking regardless,  of I got a Turtle wood look rather than a Zebra wood look. That was a big bummer.  >-<

I really loved that Zebra look. Lol.

EDIT: I upgraded it one star because they are good headphones. The sound is good, they are comfortable. I like that they can be used with our without wires. I still would have preferred the look I paid extra for, if for no other reason than that I paid extra for it - but that is really, my only complaint. Overall - great headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I'm most elated with the way they perform on symphony tracks such as Ludovico Einaudi's ""Experience"". The violins have such a gentle, smooth, and full sound, it's truly remarkable. They definitely aren't bassy or bass canons, they're warm, with a full mid-range, adequate bass, and gentle highs. Now, three things to note.

One! I wish they'd get rid of the stupid foam piece covering the driver, as all other does is veil the excellent sound, so I recommend removing it immediately.

Two! Ear pads weren't bad, but not great either. A little small, not real thick, and the padding itself ain't that great. Overall, acceptable, but I'd recommend some hm5 pads even if they take some shimmying to get on there. Other than that, they're definitely comfortable enough for me anyway.

Three! Last and definitely least, I had a slight issue with pairing these initially. However, I'm relatively incompetent, so it could've been me. Apart from that, the Bluetooth works well.

I'd wholly recommend them and will update in the future if anything changes!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I truly enjoy my headphones the Bluetooth works well. But with the 3.5mm cable sound quality is not the same. That may or may not be my phone. Bluetooth the sound quality is quite outstanding for the money, mids are a little muddy, highs outstanding, lows outstanding, bass I like a lot of bass and they deliver. I have had headphones the are over $200.00 that do not sound this clean and had less bass. I like this more.
They're a few thing I do not like. but at $70-80 it is Nitpicking, the 3.5 mm cable only connect to one side not both like the wire version. That is the reason the quality is not the same. I think. it would be nice to have voice prompts. Maybe an app for updates also simply let me know the remaining battery life. I think it beeps when batteries are low. That is speculation it has yet to happen. I've had them on for close to 5 hours. A little bigger ear cups would be nice. nice but not necessary these headphones are comfortable.  The headphone do a have a lot of audio bleed. It's nice when everyone doesn't  have to listen what I'm listening to. But this has been said over and over in the reviews, I expected it.

So far Symphonized has lived up to the hype.  If something happens I will try to update this. I gave 4 out of 5 because of the 3.5 mm audio cable with my phone sounds off and that is a little thing. They are Bluetooth and that's where they work well.  Thank you for reading this I hope it helps you.

After a week of heavy use more than a few hours a day. I think I like then better I am going to update to 5 stars. The only thing I have to add is that the buttons can be improved. Still, would like to see voice prompt and more wood and no plastic. I love these headphones for the money I feel they are underpriced.  I will try update if anything new come up.

Spoils the mids and highs.","March 15, 2017","Build quality very good, looks they are lookers alright. But these headphones are much too muddy bass heavy. I like bass to a point but only clean, tight bass. These have a muddied bass and even more muddied sub bass that spills over into the mids resulting in muddy mids. I even modified them by taking off the felt layer over the drivers (why it was even there in such muddy bass phones is beyond me). It did release some of the mids and highs but still remained muddy overall. I have 2 pairs of Symphonized earbuds and like them alot, great soundstaging and good clean sound. They also are bassy but it's a much tighter and cleaner bass that doesn't spill over into the mids or highs. I knew these phones were voiced more to the low end but I didn't expect this degree of muddiness. I would have returned them but not for the fact I had modified them. So I'm stuck with my disappointment. Would not recommend, even for bassheads.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They were light weight.  The buttons were easy to find.  They didn't sound bad to my non-audiophile self that mostly uses it to watch movies or listen to audio books.

But, after 8 months, they stopped turning on without a little bit of juice from an outlet, even though they'd just been fully charged.  Not long after that, they stopped working completely.

**EDIT**

I left them off for a few weeks, and then I charged them again and now they are working fine.  I don't have to give it a little juice to turn it on, and they hold the same charge they used to.  Maybe before it was just a temporary glitch or a problem with my charger.

For now, it's easy to give these bad boys 5 stars.

I'm not an audiophile (or at least don't consider myself one) but can certainly hear the ""muddiness"" some refer to.  There are things you can do to remove it, none of which I deem necessary to a brand new pair just yet.  They are incredibly sleek, I absolutely love the design choice and the wood definitely gives it a unique sound.  The best sound?  No, but come on.  You're not paying for the best sound.  You're paying for good sound and they deliver that for the price.

For 75$, this is a very impressive set of headphones, and I'm glad I spent the 75$ on these instead of another pair. The only tiny problem I have, is that the jack on the end of the cord is a bit loose, like it could bend or break very easily, like it's cheaply made.

I've never owned a pair of headphones that advertise noise cancellation, so I can't speak to that quality. While they sound different from my old headphones (Auvio btchp), presumably due to a difference in material composition, adaptation was quick and painless. Battery life isn't the best, but a full charge is more than enough to get through a shift. My sole complaint, which is shared by every pair of Bluetooth headphones I've owned, is the tendency to beep at maximum volume every minute or so when the battery dips below a certain percentage. A good idea on paper, if that last 5% didn't take a solid 40 minutes to run out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They feel and look like they are make with the highest quality. The wood gives the head phones a really high end look and the sound is equal to head phone that are 3X more. I wish they would come with  a booklet but it's easy to figure out the blue tooth. I like that it  also comes with a direct hook-up so you have an option to save your battery life on your devices. I wish they would offer a really nice traveling case as a separate purchase. It comes with a cloth bag but to be honest these head phone are too nice to pull out of cloth bag. These should be in a wood case or a really nice soft case. I travel a lot and I don't want these head phones to get trashed in my back pack. I have purchase a lot of products on Amazon and I rarely write a review unless the product does not live up its statements but this product passes everyone of my expectations.

Some people seem to complain about the cable breaking but I have been using the same cable for many hours every day for years and I have had no problems whatsoever. They sound fantastic especially for the price. They look cool as heck and they have proven to be reliable and durable. Noise cancelling isn't extraordinary but they serve me really well. I like still being able to hear a knock at the door if need be. That being said, they still isolate pretty darn well. The Bluetooth is a great feature to have, but I seldom use it to avoid needing to charge. When using Bluetooth, I find that there is a significant amount of latency (audio wont match up perfectly with video) but it's not terrible. The battery life is excellent, especially when I go very long periods of time without turning them on. I went almost a year without using the Bluetooth and when I used it recently, it was still fully charged. The power button is starting to give me problems but honestly it's probably just because I dropped them a few times. I just have to press it extra hard now if I want to turn them on. Some people are also complaining about the specific wood grain they received. Mine were no problem, (they look really good) but all wood is different and I doubt that they hand select the wood, so it may be a bit of a gamble. One minor touch that I really appreciate is the wood on one side of the 3.5 mm cable. It is also worth noting that the other side of the cable has a slight angle to it. Not a right angle, so it fits in every jack I have ever encountered. But it is enough of an angle to relieve some strain on the cable. Very few cables that I have owned have lasted this long. Even the micro USB charging cable is great quality. The carrying pouch was also an excellent touch. Everything about these headphones is high quality. I cant believe they are as inexpensive as they are. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sensenig","Surprised at how cheap these seem.","October 5, 2018","I'm not sure what the rave reviews are about. These seem like under forty dollar headphones to me.

The sound quality wasn't bad -- certainly better than my crappy little ten dollar earbuds! I wasn't buying these for any audiophile experience, though. I just wanted a set of bluetooth headphones for train commuting and drowning out noise at work. Good sound would have been good enough, and these seemed even a little better than that.

Sound aside, though, there was nothing to recommend these. The dealbreaker was that the headphones didn't clamp onto my head at all. They were so loose, they didn't even stay on just trying them on. I turned my head and they slid off! There's no way I could have walked anywhere in them. Even just sitting, they would have been sliding around on my head any time I moved. Either this was a used pair that had been stretched WAY out, or there was a manufacturing defect with this pair, or everyone else in the reviews section has a really big head. (I'm a large woman. My head is not small.)

The top metal band does have a little tiny bit of foam attached to it, but I wouldn't call it well-padded. The earcups seem well padded, but they didn't sit against my ears at all. They just kind of loosely touched my ears. So I can't really tell how well-padded they'd seem to someone with the aforementioned really big head.

The buttons feel exceptionally cheap as well, and like they'd break with even minimal use. They have a plastic-kids-toy feeling to them. Not what you'd expect to find on a nearly eighty dollar audio device.

And the cans themselves rattle around when you're holding the band. They market this as good flexibility -- that the ear cans adjust to your head as you move. But it's not intentional design. It's just a lousy connection of metal against metal that prevents them from staying in one place. Instead of feeling like a comfort adjusting swivel, it feels like something is loose and needs to be tightened. It also makes a little cheap tin clanking sound.

Again, I'm just not understanding how these are being sold for the money they are. As a budget grab at the checkout line, these would be a great find! (For people with giant heads, that is.) But I expected legit headphones for this money. I did not get them.

(As some other reviewers have experienced, I also ordered zebra wood and didn't receive that. Mine looked like curly maple. Pretty, but not what I ordered.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Cons:
I ordered zebra wood but got walnut wood (minus 1 star, I might return them for this reason). I saw another reviewer who got the wrong one. Seems like they don't check what they are actually sending.

For these you have to long hold to change volume and press to change tracks which is the opposite  from any Bluetooth headset I've ever used (minus another star).

Oddly enough,  the Bluetooth quality is better than the cable. Perhaps the cable this comes with is very low quality or I just got a bad one?

Pros:
They don't look too bad even though I got the wrong wood pattern.  They are more lighter that I would like, but generally aesthetically pleasing.

The sound quality is OK for the price so far, hopefully they will break in a bit after some usage.

The cable is 3.5mm on both ends, so it is replaceable (unless you want the same exact wood pattern design).

Overall:
I would not recommend these because there is no guarantee that you are actually getting what you ordered. If you are an audiophile look somewhere else. If you would like to chance it and don't mind the cons I mentioned, by all means go for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Audio quality was on point, especially for the price. It has great lows and mids, with awesome highs. I know this will sound a bit quirky, but I found these to emit a ""comforting"" sound.

The look of these beauties is magnificent, and the build quality is really solid. My only minor complaint is that the ear cups are a bit small, so for a 6' 1"" guy with huge ears like me, they became a bit uncomfortable after extended listening sessions. (But thats nothing a simple ear cup replacement wouldnt fix)

But I still think there are some legit downsides to these headphones.","September 20, 2017","I already have SteelSeries Arctis 3 headphones which cost about the same at the time of this review. I wasn't incredibly impressed with the Arctis 3 set (esp. since it is not wireless), so I decided to give these a try since they looked pretty cool and got overall good reviews. Long story short: I wouldn't purchase these again compared to what I already own at a similar price point. The only thing I really like about these is how they look. Otherwise, they're too light on the treble and too heavy on the bass for my taste. If your computer audio device allows you to independently adjust levels, that will be fine. But if your computer or other device (like my work computer) doesn't allow you to change any equalization levels, you're going to be bass heavy. They also came with the padding not fully glued to the metal head strap (as pictured in at least one other review); so, I'm unhappy about that from a new product out-of-the-box. The actual earphone pieces are a bit small for my ears, so they're a pretty snug fit if you think you have bigger ears. My biggest pet peeve is that when they're plugged-in/charging via your computer's USB port, they'll work, but you'll hear a rather high-pitched squealing which I don't find tolerable. I reproduced this result on two different computers, so I'm pinning that on the headphones and not my computers. They look nice, they sound ""good enough"" when connected via either bluetooth or audio cable, and they're decently comfy. I won't be returning them, and they'll function well for an extra set I can use at work. But I think you can do better at a similar price point.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Then the volume - button stopped working.  Sound is still good and BT still works. For how long is anyone's guess.

Update:
Email to customer service about the issue has gone unanswered.  Multiple attempts to call customer service usually resulted in a busy line.  A few times I got through and the person on the line couldn't be understood, when I explained that I had a warranty claim they hung up.  I finally did talk to someone who said they would send a shipping label for return and would repair the unit.  I told them that the warranty in the box says nothing about repair, but says they will replace the item.  All she said is to send them back.  I'll update with progress.

Make no mistake, the headphones sound great both Bluetooth and wired.  But the buttons should still work after only a few months.

Update: Three days later no shipping label. Called over and over until they quit hanging up on me. Woman on phone very rude. Insisted that label was sent and it is my fault I dont have it. Would not transfer me to anyone higher  up. I asked she send the label while I was on the phone. She refused. I swear, I was perfectly mannered anf polite, never raised my voice or anything unfriendly.  She would not let me complete a sentance and raised her voice several times.
The label did arrive by email later. I  have a suspicion that I may not get a replacement or a refund. I may be out of pocket on this one. Amazon of course will not help.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I read all the reviews published on the amazon website and was concerned about the lack of instructions. well for starters the directions were not hidden away but was one of the first things I saw when I opened the box, granted the print is small and can only be read in good lighting  this could be improved. The directions were very easy to understand but I have not used the phone system yet. The quality of the sound was a little to  bassy for me but in adjusting the sound both on my Ipad and the head set I got the sound I  was looking for. The outside noise is greatly reduced but can be heard at low volume levels but is greatly reduced. I used the headphones mainly to listen to music on Pandora and I agree with the reviewer who said it's like listing to songs for the first time. A great sound  for under $100.00. I highly recommend this headset","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The carrying case is a nice touch, bluetooth works great when working out.

The ear buds that came with my cellphone sound better. I did a side by side comparison. I received my headphones yesterday and was very disappointed taking them out of the box. It doesn't even feel like genuine wood. Laminate?  Either way it's not Zebra wood even in appearance. Many of the metal parts are plastic that is chrome in color. They do not fold or rotate though they look like they rotate in the picture at the hinges.  the padding and head band padding are all low quality material that causes a ton of sweating.  I tried charging them overnight and they have no light indicator to let you know when they are ready. The buttons and ear cups are cheap black plastic that feel like they will break.  I have not been able to get the Bluetooth to turn on.  No instructions in the package.  So if you want to look good for a week go ahead and buy these. Extremely disappointed. bought these to treat myself.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They definitely kick the sound out, with a solid showing in all ranges. They're also quite stylish--retro and futuristic at the same time, and will turn heads (I walk around San Francisco a lot, and I catch a lot of people checking them out). My biggest gripe is that as someone with long hair, I'm constantly getting pieces stuck in the adjustment sliders. No biggie, but kind of annoying. Other than that, they're quite comfortable. They don't eliminate all outside noise (obviously you need noise-cancelling headphones to accomplish that), but what does leak in is pretty minimal. They drown out a substantial amount of outside sound on a crowded BART train.

The Wraith 2.0 Wireless isn't going to blow your mind. But for the price, they're definitely on point, and I've already recommended them to a few friends looking for something with a quality sound output but not wanting to blow the bank. Dollar for dollar, you get great bang for the buck.

FYI: I mainly listen to EDM on my headphones, and these definitely aren't tailored specifically for that particular genre. Given that the housing is wood, I definitely want to give these a solid go at some classical and jazz.

All that said, being a bass/EDM junkie and wanting to entirely eliminate extraneous commute noise, I've gone ahead and ordered up a set of V-Moda Crossfade Wireless headphones. But if you're not looking to lay out  $300+, I'd certainly give the Symphonized Wraith 2.0 Wireless cans a solid endorsement.

EDIT: I just gave these a test-run with the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3 (Garrick Ohlsson/Atlanta Symphony Orchestra), and though not close to audiophile quality (again, to be expected), the sound was full & rich. Very pleased.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The design is modern, sturdy, very comfortable, and the passive noise cancellation strikes the perfect balance, especially if you are out and about and need to hear a little bit of what's going on around you without it being intrusive.  This company is relatively new, and I don't see these headphones staying this price for very long.  They are worth far more.

I'm a 6' male with a fairly sizable head and these still fit a tad more loosely than I'd like, even though they are at the smallest/tightest setting. The sound has a depth and reverberation to it from the wood shell that causes a nice richness for music but causes voices, such as an audio book or podcast, to sound as though they have some echo or as though they are being recorded in a bathroom. For the price, they're solid. Good but not great.

All of the reviews seemed positive and I've always wanted a pair of bluetooth headphones and a pair with wooden inlays like this. I thought this was that product and, unfortunately, that just isn't the case.

The first pair of these that I received would not charge at all. After several emails back and forth, I finally was able to get a shipping label to send the headphones back. However, I had to email back a week later for that label to ACTUALLY be sent. This wasn't a physical label, but a digital one, so I don't feel there was an excuse.

I was promised a new pair of headphones, only to be told two weeks later that they were trying to fix the old ones instead. Finally, after waiting another week, I was able to get a hold of someone who sent me a new pair. Between the beginning of February until yesterday, I had yet to use the product I paid for. And while they do charge, they do NOT connect to any of my bluetooth devices now.

Do yourself a favor, if you want a product from this company, just get a regular wired pair. I wish I had, it certainly wouldn't have been all this trouble. I can plug them in and use them using the adapter cable, and I will for the time being, but I won't be keeping these for very long. I've just gotten a terrible taste in my mouth for how poor my experience has been.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Cabrera","Mediocre headphones at best","October 26, 2019","This review is towards the Wraith 2.0 Bluetooth headphones. I received the headphones and to be honest; I was not impressed at all. It looks like a cheap pair of headphones you would get at Marshalls or TJ Maxx. They are small and very light. The cans themselves are a light cheap plastic, and the chrome parts look like ABS plastic. Because the headphones are light, I can see where you can wear these for a while if not for the ear pads. The ear pads are thin, about a 1/3 inch thick and the padding itself is pretty flat and not cushy at all. They are like a flat pillow. So no cushy comfort there.

The worst part is that it didn't connect to any of my Bluetooth devices. I tested it my moto phone, a sony sound bar, a Mac Pro and my MacBook Pro. None would see it. SO how I couldn't connect it via Bluetooth, I decided to unplug my razer blacksharks and plug it via cable. The sound was decent, but nothing amazing. It sounded like your average headphone. Bass was not heavy, and the music was a bit tinny. But overall okay.

I was hoping that these would be as good if not better than my owlee headphones, mainly because I have read good thing about wood headphones. Nope not here and I can not really see where all the positive reviews are coming from because these do not match those reviews at all. At the most, these are as good as $40 headphones, which you can go to your local superstore and buy a pair.

One feature that everyone was talking about was the noise canceling mentioned in the description. There's none. Thou I will say on average volume, there was no sound leakage. No one in the office was able to hear what I was listening too, which is good.

I am basically returning them. Thou $80 does not seem much, but I have gotten better quality headphones for a bit less.

IF the Bluetooth worked, I would have given these 2 stars. But it didn't, so that is why I gave them 1 star. I would look elsewhere.

UPDATE: Just examined on my pair before I pack it up to ship back, that the wood panel is not wood. Its plastic with a wood pattern veneer. Seriously?!!! No wonder they are so light. Good grief, shame on you Symphonized. Makes me wonder every review that stated this is real wood headphones is just a bot.

However for this price this is an awesome piece of headphone.

Pro's:
Sound: Awesome. Clear and quite loud on maximum volume
Comfort: These are not actually complete Over Ear headphones. But if you have small ears they would fit inside. However the cushions are very comfortable for On Ear use as well
Style: Very stylish and classy, the Wood finish makes them look much more expensive pair.
Connectivity: Bluetooth connectivity to my android was seamless
Noise Cancellation: Excellent. Outside noise was totally cut off

Cons: The only reason I had to return them was that they leak a lot of noise after medium volume. I had bought these headphones for use in office. However they were leaking so much sound, that I had no other option than to return them. If you want them for home usage, these are the perfect pair.

I wish Symphonized come with an upgraded version of Over Ear headphones with no sound leak. I would immediately buy them again. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I don't need them to be studio quality but they are a good sounding pair of headphones.  Along with a bluetooth transmitter, I listen to TV at home so I don't bother anyone else in the house.  Also, to Pandora at work so I don't have to listen to that guy with the disgusting smokers hack.
They sometimes need to be re-paired to the transmitter but that is pretty easy.  Just turn them both on at the same time and they pair up each time.
  They are pretty comfortable.  There's enough padding on top at least for me.  The ear pads are comfortable too.  I wear them for a few hours at most.
  The wood accents are a nice touch.  The instructions seem to imply that it helps with acoustics.  I don't know about that but they look great!

However wireless drops out a lot","November 2, 2018","I like the look and feel. The sound is good too. However, I purchased these for the wifi abilities. That is where they are falling down so to speak. I am seated a few feet from my ipad trying to listen to audio books. They keep cutting out. Not large chunks but a lot of little ones. I put the cord on and they are clear. My other headphones work just fine so now I'm feeling like I should have just stayed with those.
Another thing that bugs me is they do not include a user manual of any kind. I can't even find one on the internet. Just another way for manufactures to make more money while providing less product

It's almost like rediscovering my favorite music.  Also, I have very sensitive ear cartilage and cannot wear anything that puts pressure on my ears (even a snug knit hat can give me quite a lot of pain in just 20-30 minutes).  I was able to wear these comfortably for about 6 hours the other day, because they are truly over-the-ear, not on-ear (at least for me).  I work in an open-concept office and wearing these cut WAY down on the noise distractions. Our office culture is ""if you have earphones on, your virtual office door is closed"" - and people are genuinely respectful of that.  These are much more visible and distinctive than my earbuds, and send the (friendly) message that ""I'm not available for chit-chat right now.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

You'll hardly break those headphones since they are made of metal. They have some weight so don't expect running with them.
Speaking about running; the buttons are flimsy so if you move your head or walk you'll hear the buttons noise with the music.
-Battery duration is fine, they will last for few days. I only charged mine twice a week and used them every day.
-Sound quality: coming from another symphonized product (sensations headphones) the sound on this one is not better. But with some equalizer tweaks I got a descent result.
-connectivity: now this is the main and biggest problem. I was using them with my pixel 2 and they kept disconnecting from the Bluetooth. And the worst part is that they can't connect again even if you restart them. Actually everytime I needed to completely remove them from my paired devices and restart the pairing process again. And still, any little interference with the Bluetooth signal they will disconnect again and I had to pair them again.

I ended up returning them. They looked great and had a descent sound but the connectivity part is unbearable.

I had my headphones for around a year when they broke. Not sure why, but they wouldn't turn on. I wrote Symphonized and they told me to ship them back and they'd fix them. Apparently they weren't fixable, but they sent me a new pair. The fact that Symphonized stood behind their product and sent a new pair even though it had been almost a year impressed me.

Also, when comparing the quality of these to competitors (Beyer, Mpow, Nakamichi, which I also own) there's no contest, these generally sound better, fit better, look better, and just are nicer.

The picture here looks nice, Mine are not even within a Hundred mile radius of whats shown here.  There were NO zebra stripes on my headphone as shown here, The wood color looked CHEAP and unprofessional, It was like someone tried to paint over a small area after staining it as an effort to give it texture but screwed up royally. They still had the audacity to put the messed up wood pieces onto the headphone. After all, why waste a screwed up piece of wood panel when you shove it down a customer's throat. Sound quality could be, and should be better for a headphone in this price range, but it is somewhat acceptable. All in all, I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying these. THERE IS NO QUALITY CONTROL WITH THIS COMPANY.  I recommend that you look at the attached pic and compare it what they advertised and see the obvious discrepancy.
I don't have time to return these so I gave them to my 6 year old, that's really all they are worth
Hassan Khan MD.

Piece of Advise for the Administration of Symphonized. When you Advertise a Zebra wooden panel on the headphones, Install a panel that looks similar to what you advertised. it doesn't take Einstein to figure that out. One more thing, look up the meaning of "" Quality Control"".

Blickstein","Excellent set of cans","January 28, 2018","Excellent set of cans. The sound on the 2.0s, both wired and wireless, is most excellent. Plenty of bass, great separation, and 3D sound. Really nice and clean even at low volumes. I like these better than Beats and the last pair of Sennheisers I owned and at this price point these are really, really hard to beat. After reading other reviews I expected to have to modify for muddled mids and highs, but after letting these open up after a few hours of play I have found that modifications are completely unnecessary. The mids are fantastic and highs very good. I experienced no listener’s fatigue after several hours of play. Maybe some people have ear damage and are in complete denial of that condition. Speaking of ears, I’m 6’7.5” 300lb guy and these cans completely fit over ear my big ears. If these do not cover your ears you are an elephant. Ok maybe a tiny sliver of the bottom of my ears doesn’t fit inside but my entire ear is covered. The wraiths are surprisingly light and extremely comfortable. I would not these use at the gym but that’s not what they are designed for, but they travel well and come with a decent carrying pouch. The Wraiths are very attractive and a pretty solid build. These are not advertised as noise cancelling but they do a decent job of erasing outside noise. The included cables are attractive and well made. The mic is also decent and taking phone calls has been better than expected. The only possible con is that there is some leakage when played at louder volumes, but nothing excessive. For gaming they are decent but my son’s $30 headset was, not quite, but almost as good for gaming applications. For movies, these are very good, the lows are excellent and you get a 3D sound stage that competently surrounds you. The wraiths really shine the most for music play, and that was is my priority. I believe these really outshine most headsets at 2-3x the price. I am very happy with the purchase and the price makes it a real steal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Previous review:
They look cool in the photo, but there is some kind of Bluetooth clipping or syncing problem that results in the first couple of seconds of each song to skip. It’s annoying. Plus the vinyl padding on the earphones themselves has an unpleasant odor; they smell like stinky feet. It’s gross. Good thing I still have my generic $15 Bluetooth headphones I got from Walgreens - true, they don’t look as cool, but they don’t cause my music to stutter and skip, and they don’t smell like feet!

I got them for a gift this year and unfortunately, I ended up returning them. To summarize:

Pros:
-They look and feel lovely. Very comfortable.
-Great sound quality for the price
-Comes with an optional wire in the event you don't want to go the Bluetooth route or didn't charge them
-On-ear volume and previous/next track buttons
-Customer service (via email) was very friendly and responsive, although ultimately my issue could not be ameliorated, leading me to the cons...

Cons:
-Low Volume setting is not low. This was the deal breaker for me and took a 5 star item down 3 pegs. When paired with my iPhone 6S, the lowest volume was loud...too loud to listen to comfortably in a quiet room for any extended period of time for me. I tried adjusting using the earpiece volume, I tried my iPhone volume, I tried finding an internal volume setting threshold on my iPhone (there's only an option to limit max volume, not to make the lowest volume quieter); I couldn't ever get them quiet enough to tolerate in an already quiet setting before they would go to mute. In a room with  a fair amount of background noise, they'd probably be fine on the lowest setting, but that's not where I'd normally be using them. I contacted Symphonized customer service and they acknowledged this issue with their wireless products and offered me a discount on a wired model. Since my main reason for purchasing these headphones was for the wireless feature, I returned for a refund. I appreciated the offer though.
-My hair got caught in the earpiece hinges every time I took them off my head, inevitably taking a few strands with them each time.

I do pair my iPhone 6S with other Bluetooth devices and I have never had this problem before. I realize this may be a matter of preference but I expect my headphones to have a dynamic volume range that spans from barely audible up to too loud to listen to comfortably to accommodate different environments, and these phones didn't make the cut.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

And I am not even a headphones person--my ears are sensitive and I used to record in studio. In any case, these are fabulous! The only reason why I gave them four stars is because Amazon has this knack of sending you whatever they feel like sending, and I ordered the zebra pattern, but received the walnut.

I have sm-med ears, and these fit comfortably around them. The sound quality is amazing, I felt like the music was implanted in my head. I could see them distorting with certain recordings, and if the volume is high, but I don't like loud music. You can really pick up on the detail of vocals and instruments. The price is well worth the Bluetooth option, and the range is pretty decent--not exceptional--but decent. Also, you really can't hear much when you are listening to music, but these are not noise cancelling.

Glued it back to the wall and it fixed the issue.  I also pulled the foam cover off the driver, which caused the base to become much more clear.

I was really excited to receive these headphones, and initially they were great.  However, after using them for a few months, the left can is starting to rattle significantly. There's definitely something in there rattling around, and its gotten so loud that I can't move my head or take a step without a loud banging in my ear.  The sound quality isn't stellar, its not punchy and the lows sound a little soft,  however given the price I would have been happy with them provided that I didn't have banging in my left ear as soon as I move.

I first bought 2 pair for my sons for Xmas 2017 and really loved the sturdy build quality and look of the wood. They sound great and fit over the ear in my case. There is some ear fatigue so I think they're truely designed as on ear, but it depends on the individual. They felt like they would be very durable, so I ordered a pair for myself after Xmas and have had them for almost 1 year in January

Using Bluetooth, there is some choppiness with the connection when I have my mobile phone in my left pocket, and when I turn my heat to the right. I get mixed reviews from the person I'm talking to during a call. On 1 of 5 calls, I'm being told by the person on the line that can't hear me. I can't tell if there's any improvement when using the mic on the cord during calls.

Exactly 11 months after purchase, why is the power button mashed in to the point where it no longer has any spring to it and doesn't power on the headphones? Without the button working, I can't use the headphone wirelessly... their primary benifit. I happened to mention this to one of my sons a few weeks ago as the button first began sticking, and he told me that all three of the buttons on his set are stuck pushed in, so he can only use his with the cable.

I expect gently treated $100 headphones to continue to fully operate longer than 10 months. In my son's case, his buttons broke around the 8th month.

This is highly unacceptable and very disappointing. I get compliments on their unique look all the time and wanted to love them a lot longer, but now I'll have to speak the truth about this button issue. Not sure what the warranty period is or if I've passed it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Arnold","Stylish, well-built, good-to-excellent sound quality from these Wraiths.","May 5, 2018","The wood cabinets here produce pretty good bass response, which is detailed but doesnt overpower mids and treble. I got the wired version, on sale. A lot of bang for the buck. Build quality is above-average at this price point. they do have detachable cords so you can replace with a 2.5mm jack if you want. The only real downside is the metal band gets heavy after awhile. If you want even more bass, you would have to go for 50mm drivers and open-back or semi-open design, but then there would be some audio leakage, which these don't have. As theother reviewers specified, i removed the foam inner padding which is a fairly quick mod. The divers do need some burn-in time. I would describe the soundstage as well-defined, a little on the warm side, and bass-forward though not overly so. If you plan on using these for studio monitors or field recording, you should consider something more neutral-sounding instead. For home or out and about, though, I like a little more color/personality.  I've tested these with all kinds of musical genres, from jazz to reggae to hip hop to funk to rock on a lossless DAP with HQ mp3s and the ""oomph"" factor is there. Probably would be my first choice for classical music, but these cans definitely are suitable  for a versatile musical range. Also tested on my desktop system, running through the 3.5mm jack on some Mackie bookshelf monitors.  The Mackies are a lot warmer but don't isolate music as well (obviously). One slight niggle is that the cans tilt, but aren't foldable. They just barely fit into  this hardshell case i have, but they do fit.  I would say that as long as you manage expectations here, you will be pleased. These are a solid contender in the under-$100 category, and compare favorably with more-expensive options. They look cool and wont fall apart like some cans with plastic builds. they are entry-level premium headphones which work well with portable devices and home/desktop systems.  Though not advertised as noise-cancelling, they eliminate most of the surrounding sounds at normal decibel levels. They are not the best-sounding headphones ever, but a good deal for the price, especially if you get them on sale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The headset paired with my phone easily, but you do have to hold down the pairing button (which doubles as the power button) a second or two longer than it says in the instructions, otherwise it thinks you're just turning it on. Once I figured that out, everything else was smooth sailing. The sound quality is great and the connection is steady--no chipping in and out. On the day I got them, I forgot I was wearing them and laid my head down on the bed. I didn't really notice I'd done that because it was so very soft. The cushions over the ears feel like pillows! No hard plastic juts in to squeeze your ears. The material is really great quality and the headset is sturdy and well designed. (For example, if you take them off and wear them around your neck, it doesn't hamper you when you try to turn your head to each side--which was a problem I always had with other headsets.) Wearing them for long periods doesn't result in any headaches or discomfort. Plus, they're so attractive. I get compliments all the time. I love them so much I immediately bought another one for my brother, who also needed some Bluetooth headphones.

I recall reading a review that said the cables that come with the headsets get worn out quickly, but that it's difficult to find cables that fit the headset. I haven't really used my cables much so they're not worn out at all, but I got replacement ones just in case. I didn't have any trouble finding cables that fit. The standard 3.5 mm male-to-male cables worked immediately.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I saw this model listed on a blog recommendation, and I LOVED the way that these look, so I pulled the trigger and went for it. Been using them for a few weeks and they work great for my needs. I don't have high standards for sound quality, but my husband does, and he approves of my purchase. I'm a girl and my head is on the small side (intelligence jokes aside, people), so they fit me at the shortest setting. They get a little uncomfortable after several hours, so it's good to give myself a break from time to time. I don't like to listen to loud music so I keep the volume level at the lowest setting, and I can still hear everything just fine. If you have your music turned up, I suspect that it would leak the sound (high volumes are LOUD when the headphones are sitting on the desk). That's not a problem for me personally because I don't ever turn the music up, but if you enjoy blasting out your eardrums, then you might want to consider a less-leaky, more considerate option for the sake of your coworkers. ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Once I did they worked well as long as you did not look down, they would fall off your head since they don't fit very well.  After using them a few times the volume buttons stopped working so I was stuck with them on a low volume.  I contacted this company and they ran me through all the possible issues, like using the volume buttons...  Once they realized they would not work (probably 5 emails back and forth) they said that I could send them back to them for repair, as opposed to just a new set.  I knew I would never hear back from them and guess WHAT!?  They have never gotten back in touch with me.  You can really only truly tell how good a company is when things go wrong.

I called the Symphonized office and the girl that answered the phone sounded a bit annoyed from the get-go, and was telling me that the delay is called Bluetooth latency and that it's expected as their headphones are not ""zero latency"" headphones. Plugging it to my phone with the wires is fine and it fixes the problem. But that kind of defeats the purpose of buying Wireless headphones, no?

I've yet to receive a written confirmation from Symphonized that this is the nature of the headphones and not a defect on the product that I got.

These headphones have a nice look and feel, though they're more delicate than they appear. The bluetooth seems to work great. Didn't have any bluetooth lag issues like other's have stated when I connected them on Windows 10. The sound quality however is pretty mediocre. If you crank the volume up, the sound, especially the bass starts to sound muffled and you can tell the location of the sound to be the earphones rather than just out in open space. They don't isolate from outside sounds as well as I was hoping either. I had a cheap SADES $25 headset prior that has much better sound quality and isolation, but the ear cups were starting to peel and I wanted something more stylish so I tried these. Disappointing for $75 earphones to sound worse than the $25 ones.

The sound quality on these could definitely be better, but overall these earphones are pretty nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They light up on the charger, and turn on when charging, but when they are not connected to a power source they can't be activated. Contacted the company and it's out of warranty, so now they're very pretty paperweights. The company offered a 15% discount on future purchases, but for the price I want to get something that lasts longer than 1.5 years. As much fun as they were and as beautifully designed as they are, I can't recommend the product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Look somewhere else. PS. these positive reviews are bots.","November 7, 2017","This review is towards the Wraith 2.0 Bluetooth headphones. I received the headphones and to be honest; I was not impressed at all. It looks like a cheap pair of headphones you would get at Marshalls or TJ Maxx. They are small and very light. The cans themselves are a light cheap plastic, and the chrome parts look like ABS plastic. Because the headphones are light, I can see where you can wear these for a while if not for the ear pads. The ear pads are thin, about a 1/3 inch thick and the padding itself is pretty flat and not cushy at all. They are like a flat pillow. So no cushy comfort there.

The worst part is that it didn't connect to any of my Bluetooth devices. I tested it my moto phone, a sony sound bar, a Mac Pro and my MacBook Pro. None would see it. SO how I couldn't connect it via Bluetooth, I decided to unplug my razer blacksharks and plug it via cable. The sound was decent, but nothing amazing. It sounded like your average headphone. Bass was not heavy, and the music was a bit tinny. But overall okay.

I was hoping that these would be as good if not better than my owlee headphones, mainly because I have read good thing about wood headphones. Nope not here and I can not really see where all the positive reviews are coming from because these do not match those reviews at all. At the most, these are as good as $40 headphones, which you can go to your local superstore and buy a pair.

One feature that everyone was talking about was the noise canceling mentioned in the description. There's none. Thou I will say on average volume, there was no sound leakage. No one in the office was able to hear what I was listening too, which is good.

I am basically returning them. Thou $80 does not seem much, but I have gotten better quality headphones for a bit less.

IF the Bluetooth worked, I would have given these 2 stars. But it didn't, so that is why I gave them 1 star. I would look elsewhere.

UPDATE: Just read and examined myself on my pair before I pack it up to ship back, that the wood panel is not wood. Its plastic with a wood pattern veneer. Seriously?!!! No wonder they are so light. Good grief, shame on you Symphonized. Makes me wonder every review that stated this is real wood headphones is just a bot. Amazon really needs to place a stop to this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sound quality remains the same but it no longer reaches ""level 10"" volume and now maxes out at maybe a level 6. I've checked every thing with my devices and sadly it's the headphones. I'm pretty bummed and meant to return them and when I went to today after I got off work I missed the return deadline by about 30 minutes so now I'm stuck with headphones that no longer bump in any way. Oh well we had a good run.
I have a lot to say about them but real talk, I picked these up on the 24th of March, used them every day sometimes corded but mainly I used Bluetooth. After the first couple days I thought I would be hearing some sort of battery warning. Well I just heard it, after 10 and a half days of use. Literally used them at least an hour a day.

The good: they look great, sound quality is good for the price, the bluetooth works ok (as good as bluetooth can), and I love the control buttons on the left side.

The bad: they are too big on me and slip off if I bend my head forward at all. They are somehow still uncomfortable like they are too small. I have sensitive ears so those less sensitive may not have much issue, but these cause me greater discomfort than previous large headphones. I get a headache and ear ache after just an hour or two of listening. They also leak noise more than I'd expect (maybe because they're a poor fit on me?), but it's not terrible. The real kicker though, mentioned in other reviews....the hair pulling! I cannot for the life of me take these off my head without ripping hair out of my head (I have long hair). Seriously, it's the worst!

The headphones are also way too big for me and fall off if I bend forward briefly.

Really love the walnut cups, has nice touch feeling to it. Light clamping force to it on my slightly larger head; feels really comfortable with the padding on the band. For my above average ears, it's almost an on-ear headphone

(also not sure if pad will wear out because of sweat, but I reckon it will, judging from other review. Really recommend to replace the stock pad with something like HM5 pad)

3.5 mm cable seems sturdy. I haven't tested the mic.

As of the product QC, my volume (-) button is not working on day 1.

Sound: Obligatory ""I'm not an audiophile"" opening sentence. After a month of listening I can say these cans have definitely a V shaped sound profile. The mids are muddy, but still bareable for watching a regular Youtube video or documentary. Soundstage and detail are there, but it's pretty average.

It does not deliver too much volume (I usually have to crank up to 80-90%). Also on cable and bluetooth the sound differs (actually sound worse on wire for some reason, some of the bass is gone and all the life in the music is gone)

Feature: pairing with bluetooth is easy and intuitive; with bluetooth 4.1, you have a lot of space to move around. Delay is minimum that it's almost not noticeable.

It has NO noise cancellation feature as in description, but it has good noise isolation. However sound leakage seems to be an issue on high volume.

I don't think the headphone is meant to fold, so storing and carrying around in a bag would be a hassle.

Other: the stock 'bag' made from straw like material to store the headphone feels cheap and smells (reminds me of sack where you store grain rice). No USB charging adapter provided.

Conclusion: pretty looking headphone, average sound quality, average build quality. I would not recommend this to a friend though unless they don't really give a crap about sound quality and want bluetooth on their pretty headphone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

They are well-made and the sound is clear. It also does a good job for being a ""lower-end"" wireless headphone set, especially a pleasant surprise with just how good the bass sounds.

I also bought these because of all the glowing reviews. I won't bore you with all the good stuff because the majority have written about it. However, I disagree with almost all the positive reviews. I own a ton of HPs, ranging from $10-$1000.  I can close my eyes as pick from any of my collection and it would outperform this JUNK.

Let's address the negatives:

1) the cups are too small even for my GF's tiny ears. The cups are too small and too shallow.
2) bc the cups aren't perforated, my ears get hot quickly.
3) the buttons are very cheap feeling and very loose, to the point where I think it's gonna fall apart.
4) I absolutely hate how the + / - buttons work. Every BT HPs I have work the same way except for this one. Typically you quickly push the + button to increase the volume and hold to skip the song. These HP works exactly the opposite.
5) as some positive reviewers have mentioned that these cans can be muddy and they are. I have taken the foam out and they're still muddy to the point where it's not pleasurable to listen to.
6) they are not noise cancelling as advertised. They chose a very deceptive term: noise isolation.
7) I haven't tested the claimed 8-9 hours, but I won't hold my breath. There's a reason why the hours ain't listed. You can only find it on the included documentation.

If you want recommended alternatives, any Sony BT HP can out-perform this junk. Yes I have 3 Sony BT headphones: mdr1000, mdr100 and xb950.

Edit: I forgot to add that when adjusting volume on your device, the HP doesn't respond until literally 10 secs later. Nearly blew out my drums.

Edit 4/7/16: just got off the phone with a rep. They're making me pay return shipping for a defective item. The rep said a 10 sec delay for a volume response is acceptable. In what world is that acceptable? Please save yourself the trouble and buy something else.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Symphonized-Wraith-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B01MYYH3PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
