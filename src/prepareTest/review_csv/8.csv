That being said, I loved these head phones. I had 18 hours worth of flights and I knew I needed something that would be comfortable and block some of the noise. I did a lot of research and these were recommended to me, and for that I am thankful. They were super comfortable to wear. I am a TERRIBLE sleeper on airplanes, so I end up moving a lot trying to get comfortable, these stayed in place the whole time. The noise cancelling function was better than I expected, but still not 100% perfect. But again $70 vs  $300. I could definitely tell a major difference when I turned it on. I didn't have any problems listening to music or the in-flight movie with the noise cancelling function on. I know other complained about that, I did listen to a podcast but not an audible book- I didn't find problems with any of the sound.

They were so comfortable that I didn't mind wearing them around the airport. This was big for me as I hate having things covering my ears, it was a pleasant surprise.

They held up great on the trip. I would like a harder case, but I had no problems. I charged them overnight before I left and they lasted through the whole trip. Not sure how many total hours- I didn't have them turned on or in use for all the flights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Vaughan","Great Headphones!","August 15, 2017","I got the headphones earlier today and got them charged up. I was pleasantly surprised to see how they were made and constructed.  They are a bit heavy to hold, but once they were on my head, they didn't feel as heavy at all.  In fact, I was amazed how light they felt wearing them.  The sound quality is beyond excellent.  I was also amazed at the stereo separation.  The bass is good as well as the rest of the sound spectrum.  It was nice to hear such detail in most any song I played at a reasonable level and at a much higher level.  I was however, I bit unsure about how they sounded with the noise cancelation turned on - it made the mid range sound a bit exaggerated and left the highs and lows a bit lower.  However, I did notice that any ambient noise in the house was reduced.  The only thing I did not like was the power switch as it was a bit hard to turn on or change from one setting to another.  It's not a big deal, but it does take a bit to adjust it. I really liked how I could adjust the volume or change tracks I was listening to with the same button, very nicely designed feature.  They paired with my iPad Pro flawlessly and quickly.  Overall, a great set of headphones that I would recommend to anyone looking for a reasonably affordable, quality set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

It was claimed that these headphones use “noise isolation” ( which blocks out noise passively and without use of power ). I put them on when I got them and tested out the feature. There was no difference from wearing them to not wearing them. So I though, “okay, maybe they need battery power before they can isolate noise, for some unnecessary reason.” So I let them charge for 8+ hours and put them on. Still no difference. I turned on the active noise canceling feature ( which technically isn’t part of the product according to the manufacturer’s list of “extra features”). Active noise canceling SHOULD have replace the noise of the outside world with another noise, which it didn’t. There was still no difference from wearing them to not wearing them. I didn’t even bother testing if the Bluetooth worked or if it even produced sound. I just shipped it back. To any cowin employees, here’s a manufacturing tip; don’t claim that your product has something when it really doesn’t.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

**************************************************************************************************************
I want to keep the original review because, in all honesty, they are not noise-canceling. But, Lexi, from Cowin Corporate reached to make a deal with me. And, she sent me a totally different set of headphones (SE7) and I have to say that once you get the hang of synching with each device each time you use or change devices, they work pretty well. The noise-canceling function works on the SE7 - and I have a loud partying neighbor upstairs and I kept my sanity all weekend with them on. Also, they are just as comfortable for my tiny female ears. My father found them comfortable as well and he has manly ears. For simple headphones that are comfortable and play music = E7. For noise canceling function + comfy + music = SE7.

I was looking for something to cancel out background noise so I can concentrate better on my studies when I found this. They offered a 1 day shipping when I bought them and I was so excited when I got them the next day.  I open the package and the packaging itself was beautiful. I was not expecting that. It felt like I was getting the real deal headphones. I still haven't thrown the packaging out and it's been two weeks haha. The headphones itself is great for the price I paid them for. It won't completely block out noises like people talking loudly, but it will block out background noise. Listening to music has also been more fun since I got these headphones since I will walk around the house and it is still playing.

I also have to mention that I thought my volume was off on one side and I thought that there was something wrong with the headphones. So I contacted the seller and they immediately responded within that day. They offered to replace the product, so that was really cool. The next day the volume was fine, so I actually didn't need a replacement. But the fact that matters is that the seller has amazing customer service because they responded right away and offered to replace it. So overall, these headphones are great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are an excellent value for the money. Cost less than 25% of the Sony's, but are 99% as good when it comes to sound quality and noise cancellation.
A couple of caveats:
They are heavier than wired-only due to weight of rechargeable battery. Not significant but notable. Comfortable over the ear for extended periods (I fell asleep many times with them on and no issues with discomfort).
Battery life: Tested with noise cancellation on and off. With noise cancellation off, easily met the 30 hours between charges as advertised. With noise cancellation activated, battery life drops to 8-9 hours. Acceptable to me, but be aware of how you intend to use them.

I was generally pretty happy with them. For the money I felt they did the job, and well. The sound was fairly good, and the sound canceling helped in my office setting. However yesterday I had them sitting in my lap and they started to fall, I brought my legs together (not even quickly, or hard) to stop them from falling and the two ear pieces snapped off. BOTH! The attachment of the ear pieces to the head piece is extremely delicate. I was shocked they both snapped and so easily. They are completely unusable now and don't even power on for some reason. I won't say that no one should buy these, but BE AWARE they are delicate and the ear pieces break off very easily.

They seemed to work well. I don't think they actually do any real noise canceling (not actively, at least), but they blocked out a fair amount of noise and I could hear my podcasts while I worked. After about a year of roughly weekly use, they started dropping the bluetooth signal from my phone that was in my pocket. It started out as irregular, at first, but, over the last few months, it became pretty constant - every 10 seconds or so it would drop the signal and I couldn't hear my podcasts. I tried re-connecting the headphones with my phone and adjusting various settings. I then bought some new bluetooth headphones to see if it was my phone. The new ones (a different brand) work perfectly. It's not my phone. It's these. They worked fine for about a year but now are useless. I know they aren't super expensive, but I'd like more than a year's worth of use for the price.

[UPDATE: In August of 2019, someone from COWIN reached out to me because of this review. They said they would replace the headphones for free in return for me updating my review. I added a star to my review for the good customer service. I appreciate their willingness to try to make customers happy.

Very, very, very (did I say very?) pleased!","June 22, 2017","There are only a few purchases that I make a year that really give that ""wow"" factor. With Bose, Beats and other brands charging $300+ for headphones I wasn't sure I would ever be in the ""noise canceling headphones"" cool kids crowd. I'm frugal and I just can't justify spending that much on a set of headphones. But I can justify less than $100 since I spend a lot of time on planes and I'm tired of watching movies on my iPad with all that growling in the background. So I gave the Cowin E-7 a shot. And boy did I get that ""WOW"" factor. It's actually more like a ""ZOWWWWEY"" factor. These are well made, have battery love that survived both legs of my trip from Connecticut to Los Angeles for a total of 13 hours with no charge and the noise cancelation is really amazing. At one point the plane was so smooth, and my headphones were so quiet, it was an eerie feeling to think I was 40,000 feet in the air and cruising at 500 miles per hour. Very, very, VERY happy.

I just spent the entire day traveling on planes and in airports and the battery life is very good. At one stop I did add a bit of charge to them but just to be safe type thing and I don't believe I would have had an issue if I didn't. They also come with a plug so that if you wanted to use them with a unit that had no bluetooth, they would also work.
Overall the noise canceling works well as long as there is a song playing. However at that point in between songs you can hear quite a bit of outside noise and on planes you still get some of the plane noise. This didn't bother me and for the price and I'm very happy. I did have a previous pair of Bose NC headphones and they cancelled almost all noise but then again they were way more expensive and #2 they died after 2 years.

As for the sound quality, I  found that they were really base-y, if that's your preference these will work just fine for you. The noise cancellation is okay, does it's job but not the best, which is fine considering the price. Be warned though, music will sound flatter and just a bit louder in NC mode than in Bluetooth mode, which I'm still iffy about. I also wish they could have had a better volume range.

I see some buyers say they reached out to the seller to get help with their problems with this headset.  I did not. The seller reached out to me.  It was felt that I probably got a defective headset.  I was asked to give it another try or a complete refund.  I wanted it to work, so I decided to give them another try. I am glad I did. The seller had another pair delivered to me within two days.

Now I will repeat for my pair what I said for my friend's. The sound was great and the headphones comfortable.  I own several types of headphone and my most comfortable pair is my Sony but they are not wireless.  Syncing was quick and easy. Noise cancellation was good. They are comfortable and easy to wear. I walked throughout the house and had no problems with the reception. After my first pair proved unsatisfactory, I ordered the COWIN E7 PRO [2018 Upgraded] Active Noise Cancelling Headphone. Funny thing is I like these better than those.
********************************************************************
I was visiting a friend who showed me his new black  COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones.  I asked him the next time he was at my house to bring them over so I could try them out.

He did.  The sound was great and the headphones comfortable.  I own several types of headphone and my most comfortable pair is my Sony but they are not wireless. I was impressed with the noise cancellation.  Syncing was quick and easy. My wife was talking to me six feet away and while I saw her lips moving I could not tell what she was saying.  The TV was on about ten feet away and I could not hear it.  I walked throughout the house and had no problems with the reception.

I was sold so I ordered a pair.  Being different I ordered my in purple.

I was disappointed in my headphones.  There was very little difference in the noise cancellation mode and the non-cancellation mode.  In either mode I could hear the wife and/or the TV.  My range did not extend to the bedroom at the other end of the house.  And the worst part that I really can't explain is when I tried to adjust the volume, the sound ""disappeared"" until the phones were turned off and back on.  OK so something is wrong here.  Sound quality was quite good but the other problems is the reason they go back to Amazon go. My friend reports no problems with his headphones so maybe I just got a bad one.  Probably should have ordered black and not purple.

I ordered the COWIN E7 PRO [2018 Upgraded] Active Noise Cancelling Headphone.  I am hoping they will be better.

They aren't in the same class as the Bose QC 35, but those cost 6x more. My biggest concern was that the ANC would have a static noise, but it doesnt.  I gave them 4 stars because there is SOME room for improvement. The ear piece swivels and plastic control buttons don't scream durability, and while sound replication is pretty darn good, they don't get super loud. The noise cancelling is pretty impressive for the price point, but manage your expectations. It eliminates the drone from my pellet stove pretty well, but I can still hear when the pellets feed in.

It's not silent when you wear them - voices of others can still be heard, but that's typical of most noise cancellation headphones, and it's certainly muffled. Super comfortable, but if you wear glasses, you may need to take short breaks. I've found they slightly press the arms of my glasses into the bone behind my ears, but it's not noticable unless it's been more than a couple hours.

Mine are still fine, and I treat mine considerably rougher, so it seems to be luck-of-the-draw. If you get a pair that don't break, these are awesome.

The noise cancelling feature works pretty well. I can still hear some background noise, but it reduces the sound enough that it's not distracting. Sometimes I listen to music too, and the sound quality is good. I haven't noticed any static with or without the noise cancelling on. I've tested the microphone and it seems to work well for calls. There are a two things I wish were a little different. The first is that the quietest possible volume is still medium loud. I like music to fade into the background when I'm working, and these don't get quite as quiet as I'd like. Since I mostly only use the noise cancelling I'm okay with that. The second thing is, I wish they were designed to fold up a little smaller. I wanted to try these for noise cancellation when flying, but they're too bulky to pack in my backpack along with all the other items I need. I'll be sticking with my earbuds for planes. Final note - I could foresee that some people's ears would get uncomfortably hot and sweaty when using these. I doesn't bother me at my desk, but I wouldn't use them for exercise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Think about that. That's like taking out your glass eye so you can put on a pair of glasses to see better! I needed a pair of headphones that would be 1. Comfortable enough to wear for extended periods while wearing my hearing aids, and, 2. build and sound quality that at least matches what you paid for the headphones. As far as comfort goes, these are the most comfortable headphones I have worn to date. The sound quality is great for me and I'm half deaf:) Because I can keep my hearing aids in I can hear the full range of frequencies and they sound great. When I put them on, the room goes quiet and all I hear is the music or video coming through the headphones. I read many of the reviews prior to purchasing this set of headphones from 5 stars to 1 star. The 4s and 5s all had the same things in common, great sound and quality for the price. The 1s and 2s all had the same things in common, built cheaply because they broke within 6 months or a year. Overall and taking all things into consideration, if you are the type that is rough on your stuff, don't get these. Go out and buy a 4 pound rock solid set of headphones that you can drop from a plane or drive a truck over. I you want a pair of headphones that sound great and are decent quality, these are for you. BTW, all the customers that complained about the headphones breaking or not working within a year. Why don't you contact the seller? They warranty the headphones for 18 months, except for I imagine neglect or abuse. Here is their email.  cowinservice@163.com  I love the reviews that tell about a problem, contact the seller and then report back the results. Everybody loves good customer service so if a product fails, at least give the seller an opportunity to make it right and report that so that we buyers know what kind of service to expect.

The sound is very amazing and the battery life is incredible! Got this yesterday after 24 hour ship for free with Prime and couldn't be more impressed. The material feels fine, not sure if it will hold up in the gym with sweating so I'll use these specifically for traveling or just sitting in a coffee shop or office use. I'm simple, no need to use anything fancy not even the noise cancellation since sound is very superior already. The comfort of the pads are awesome as well. Couldn't go wrong with his, may have to get the rest of the family these headphones. Much cheaper than Beats or Bose and from what I understand the sound and comfort is similar.

One week later Update: Nothing wrong with it, just want to say the battery life is fantastic. I got this last week and charged it once and since then the battery life still shows full capacity!

I have had these for a week now and they are great wireless headphones. The unit is sturdy and built well. They are comfortable to wear, highly adjustable,have a soft/cushy pad, and fit quite snug around my ears. The bluetooth range is actually very good, I had no problems walking around the house with a strong connection. They connect flawlessly with my Samsung S6 and reconnect as soon as they are turned on. The NFC also works well to establish a connection almost instantaneously. Phone calls can be easily picked up and dropped with the play button. The active noise cancelling is decent. Microphone was pretty clear and my friend was able to hear me talk quite well. The buttons on the unit are somewhat shakey but still feel sturdy (they arent going to fall off).  The pouch that comes with it is awesome to protect your headphones from scratches.
Bottomline is if you need a pair of inexpensive headphones I think this would be a good choice. I would recommend them to a friend. The finish of the item is pretty beautiful minus the fingerprint marks that sometimes get left behin but oh well you can't have everything in life. I bought these on my own dime.

I basically live in these, and they are AMAZING! I cannot speak highly enough. The battery lasts 2-3 days (though I try to recharge it in the night), and recharges really fast. It connects nicely and automatically to my phone (if I want to swap it to my laptop I have to do it manually but, not a big deal). The padding is comfy and doesn't bother me at all, and the noise canceling works incredibly even in the NYC subway/streets. Overall, I would recommend these to basically anyone, but I do have three tiny complaints. One, the blue indicator light doesn't really *need* to be on all the time, just feels like a waste of battery? At least being able to toggle that would be nice. Two, the shiny finish does show fingerprints, so if you really care about that then these might not be ideal for you. Three, they make a little squeaking noise not unlike a mouse when they're around my neck and I'm walking around, which as someone who works in a mouse lab, occasionally gives me anxiety attacks about someone escaping.

Comfort: They are comfortable to wear for several hours (3-4 hours before I remove mine for a break). The around the ear cup is just a little bit small for me so my outer lobes are still pressed against my head, but the cushion and leather are comfortable that it doesn't hurt at all. My ears just get a little sweaty from being pressed but I can arrange the cup to not press my earlobes. I don't have large ears (I'm more average male ear).

Noise canceling: Reduces noises around you significantly. Not going to be dead silent (only completely silences out white-noise types of a noise of low volume). I haven't tried other noise canceling headphones, but I'm happy with this one.

Sound: Clear sound, would like a bit more bass sound but overall good quality sound.

Mic: Terrible mic (-1 star), it's sufficient, but sounds like crap compared to using my internal mac laptop microphone. I setup my laptop to use the internal mic instead of the E7 mic.

Bluetooth range using laptop: very short range (20ft with line of sight for clarity of sound), going through walls/metal anything will cause sound syncing issue (cutouts, drops, etc). Gets worse with distance and more things. Good thing is around 30-50ft it will drop the connection, but if you walk back into range it will reconnect automatically.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I saw the Cowin E7 headphones recommended on a list somewhere and decided to give them a shot, and I've been using them ever since. The sound is better than I expected for the price range, and the fit is much more comfortable. I like the complete over-ear style, which is better at physically blocking out sound, in addition to the active noise-cancelling function.

REASON:  Some of the issues I was having with sound quality had to do with Bluetooth connectivity.  Connecting the headphones with an audio cable greatly improved the sound quality. But it is still not great, so I am giving it only 3 stars.

ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:

As a professional video editor, that has spent thousands of hours with headphones on listening very carefully to audio.  I have used a plethora of headphones.

These headphones have over thirteen thousand positive reviews and one would think with that many good reviews, they would have to be good. Well, they are okay, but have some things that need improvement.

The main thing I hate about these is the sound quality.  The volume of these headphones is so low that even after cranking everything up top maximum, the volume is still about 50% lower than any other set of headphones I have ever used.  But the volume is not the only thing.  The audio itself is horrible.  These headphones have no treble at all.  They are just pure bass with no treble, and the bass is soft.  So, if you combine the low volume, the lack of treble, and the softness of the bass, what you get is audio that sounds like you are listening to music through a pillow.

Noise cancelation is achieved by creating a seal around your ears.  Unfortunately, the side effect of this is that as soon as you put these things on, your ears stop up like you dropped 1000 feet in altitude all of the sudden and you feel like you have to pop your ears to hear clearly.  I have used a lot of good headphones with excellent noise cancelation that did not create an airtight seal around your ears and make you feel like you have a head cold, as these do.

Another thing that is just inconceivable to me is that these headphones have no energy conservation mode.  If you forget to manually turn these off, they will stay on until they die.  Even when they are not connected to Bluetooth, they will still not turn off automatically.  Every other Bluetooth headset I have will shut off after a period of inactivity or when they are not connected to Bluetooth.  Not these.  The just stay on until they kill the battery.

After two weeks trying these things out, I gave them away.  All I can say is, there are a lot of people out there that like these things, but as a professional video editor, I hated them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Construction: I haven't had any problems with them yet, but they do feel a little light and flimsy. They're primarily plastic.
Comfort: Very comfortable and remain comfortable throughout the day.
Sound quality: Leave a lot to be desired. Not bad, not great either. There is a TON of bass that almost covers the mid-range tones. I tweaked the equalizer on my phone though and it sounded ok.
Noise cancellation: Don't expect silence. They do work quite a bit to cancel out noises, but they aren't perfect. My biggest complaint is that the music drops by a few dB when you turn on ANC.
Overall design: As I said, they are primarily plastic but they do look nice. My only gripe is that if you plan on wearing these in the dark to sleep, get some tape and tape a little piece of paper over the power light. In a totally dark room, I felt like I was wearing a miner's helmet lol. It's like a flashlight attached to your head.

Do I wish they were better? Yes. Do I feel disappointed for what I paid for them? Only slightly. I feel like all of the money I spent on them went into ANC and not quality of sound. I know I can't get the best of both worlds without paying a little more, though, which is why I'm only slightly disappointed.

Overall, these aren't great, not bad, just ""fine"".

I've had them for over a year now, and they are a gift that never stops giving. Here are some specifics that I like:
- The sound cancelling works very well, and can be switched on and off depending on your surroundings
- The sound is great! I have no complaints
- The headphones are durable and sturdy. Somebody even knocked them off my head on accident, but they still work fine.
- They are very comfortable. I never have problems with them not fitting properly, itching, or anything else
- The bluetooth is amazing! My phone connects to them about three seconds after I turn them on, and I never have problems with the sound cutting in and out. The range is also excellent.
- The built in controls are very useful. They allow you to change songs, adjust volume, and pause or play your music.
- The battery life is insanely long. I listen to music and podcasts for 2-3 hours each day, and the battery still usually lasts more than a week. It also gives you a low battery warning by beeping, which is pretty useful.

Some things I don't like:
- After heavy use, the material on the ear cups is wearing away. Everything still works fine, but they just aren't quite as comfortable.
- They're BIG. These headphones are not something you'd want to take on vacation or work out with. They are fairly heavy and bulky, but the quality of the product completely makes up for it.

Pros:  Comfortable. Fairly lightweight. Very good sound.  Easy to pair.  I'm VERY glad I bought these headphones.

Cons:  I'd be happier if they were a bit less expensive.  Like others have noted, the ""metal looking parts"" are plastic but this keeps the weight down and I don't foresee that being a problem.

I bought these to solve a problem and they did just that.  I am VERY happy with them and, as always, Amazon.

I feel as if it needs a toggle for the headphones themselves to filter out the horrible sound that comes out of them.

I am absolutely disgusted. I have gotten better quality from $30 headphones. I'd wager you could pick up a cheap pair at any old store that would rival these.

Davis","Not Great for Phone Conversations","June 3, 2019","The Pros: I ordered two pairs of these headphones, one for me and one for my brother. I liked their flashy style with blue LED. When I put them on, they felt great and I was very happy with the sound quality coming through them as well as the battery life. Crisp highs, deep bass, and decent mids. I was not expecting much from the Noise Cancelling feature. I was impressed with the noise cancelling when I tested it as well. I could hear it quite clearly dampening ambient noise in the house. At 50 to 60 bucks each, the price was right.

The Cons: However, when I made a call using them, I was told that the audio quality on the other end was poor. I tested this by switching to speaker phone and when I did so the audio quality improved. I also tested it by leaving a voicemail on a friend's facetime account. When I listened to it back, it had background noise and sounded more like a CB radio than a phone conversation. When I received a call from my brother using another pair of  e7s, the voice quality from his headset also sounded poor. I could only understand most of what he was saying and often had to ask him to repeat himself. If we had a short message to convey, the mic would have worked ok for that, but it would be unpleasant for a longer conversation. That is why I am giving this headset three stars.

I sent a message to customer service. They did get back to me, but I did not hear them out because I decided to return them.

I replaced them with a pair of TaoTronics and a pair of Utaxo. So far, we are satisfied with those purchases.

This review applies only to the E7 model. I do not know if they fixed the issue with the Pros or on other models.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The battery lasts a long time. Very clear sound with the NC turned on. They connect SUPER fast to my bluetooth and have a very good range.

My only 'issues' if you could call them that are the shiny surfaces. Matte finishes seem to be a much better idea because these get fingerprints and smudges on them easily and it kills my OCD. HAHA :D

The bass doesn't seem to be super good but I typically listen to podcasts at work to drown out my co-workers, so these work fantastic.

I don't have much to compare them do as far as actual headphones go but I can't imagine the casual user and listener needing anything more than these. They get plenty loud, are very clear and the battery lasts quite a long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I had high hopes for this thing having read some 14,000 reviews - it’s got great reviews.  But I’m gonna have to subtract a star and the simple reason is this.  Like many others I am seeking a LOUD alternative to ear buds.  I want my ears to bleed ok ?  I want hearing damage I want SOMETHING Bluetooth that can compare to wired and sadly this just isn’t it.  That being said it’s one of the best bluetooth Over ear sets I’ve ever owned and gains its place at 4 stars with me.  Also the noise cancelation is at or on par with Bose.  Sound clarity is exceptional it’s a great sounding set of headphones.  It’s just not freaking loud enough.  None of them are.  Nothing compares to wired.

1. Ease of operation—— Quite easy. Connects to Bluetooth device in a snap. It has only two function buttons that keeps things simple. One button is off, connect and noise canceling. The other does double duty as a pause/mute and telephone answer button. This same button is used for ending the call.
2. Comfort- This device couldn’t be more comfortable to wear. Adjusting is easy. The phone material is softer than a baby’s arse.
3. Noise canceling— I’m not a fan of the noise canceling on this product. Turning the noise canceling on you get a drone like sound that can be quite annoying. The NC also seems to lessen the quality of the music sound.
4. Sound Quality—- The sound quality is good, clear and has enough bass. I am quite impressed with the quality of the sound. Take note dear friend that this is not an Alpine, Bose, or Polk, but, that said, the sound quality is very good.
5. Charging—- Simple as pie. The first change can take up to four hours, but my set only took half that.

I really like this product. It seems to very well made and sound quality is very good. For the price you get a really good set of headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

IBackground noise that is static, such as a noisy air conditioner or lawnmower, just disappear. Voices do not get cancelled so much, BUT: The passive noise cancelling of these headphones (just by sheer blocking of sound), and playing music or white noise, I can completely block out my kids while I'm doing work from home or homework.

and my kids are NOISY!!!

I wear these and listen to music while i mow the lawn.  I can barely even hear the lawnmower while im pushing it.

I wear these at work to drown out the noise of the other people.

The battery life on these is incredibly good. The sound is good. The value is OUTSTANDING.

Edit: 2.5 years later I’m still using these same headphones. Just as happy today as i was in 2017.  I use them still while mowing the lawn, on a plane, or using power tools. They aren’t hearing protection rated per say but they work great and have held up better than any other headphone I’ve ever bought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

First off, the sound quality is absolutely amazing. 10/10 you can NOT get better budget headphones than this. I switched to these from a pair of Skullcandy Crushers and the difference is night and day. They are crystal clear and you can hear everything, from classical piano to heavy metal. I'd say the sound quality rivals that of Bose or Sennheiser. As I listen to my favorite songs, there are so many things that I never heard before, whether it's a subtle piano melody or entire hidden lyrics.

Comfort wise, they are amazing. I can't even feel them on my head. I wear them for 6+ hours a day sometimes and they never hurt. They're still as comfy as the moment I put them on. They're a little bit big for me (cursed with a small head) but I can get away with wearing them by not extending the sides at all.

Battery life is great. These really do run for 15-20 hours. It feels like I almost never charge them. I charge mine once a week at the most, and they're fully charged in about half an hour. This has blown me away and I have zero complaints. This alone is why people should pick these.

The noise cancellation gets the job done. I'd say it's on par with other headphones in this price point on the market. If I'm in a silent room, I can't hear the person next to me. I personally use mine on a loud freeway bus and it blocks out roughly 70% of the sound, though it gets hard to hear my music (and I have to listen to loud rock or metal to be able to hear it at all). This is where issue number one comes in.

Issue 1: they are too quiet. Even at full volume, the are never quite loud enough, especially for rock/metal music and loud environments. I use Spotify personally, which I have noticed doesn't play music as loud as other apps to begin with. Switching to something like Google Play or YouTube can help, but it still isn't loud enough. I guess you could see this as a positive, because it prevents hearing damage, but I like my loud metal music.

Issue 2: There is noise bleed over. This one is weird. I can listen to rock music on half volume with these, and if I'm in a quiet room the person next to me can hear my music as loudly as if I was blasting it at full volume. If I'm listening at full volume, watch out because it's like a speaker. That can lead to some awkward moments unless you keep the noise turned down while in the library.

Issue 3: the controls. These controls need to die. I use my phone to control them and only my phone. I don't know what it is, but these are the most unintuitive and least user friendly controls possible. There was definitely a learning curve. The triangle shape looks good, but doesn't work well in practice. Tapping the down arrow skips to the next song (rather than changing the volume) and you have to hold it down to actually change the volume. This gives you little control over the actual volume level. The upper arrow does the opposite. And until you're used to it, you have to feel around with your fingers and take a guess at which is the right one.
Then there's the center button. This pauses your music, which is good. BUT do not tap it twice unless you want to accidentally redial the last person you called on your phone (if your phone is connected). That is a weird feature, and there's no way to turn it off. After too many awkward accidental calls, I gave up on even touching that button.
Last control issue is the switch. It has three settings: off, Bluetooth alone, and noise cancelling. Turning it from off to noise cancelling is easy. But when switching out of noise cancelling mode to normal, 50% of the time I end up moving the switch a notch too far and accidentally turn them off. Yeah.

Issue 4: If your battery is dead, you cannot listen. Period. With a lot of headphones, you can still listen by using an AUX cord, but not on these. When they're dead, they're useless.

Overall, these are amazing if you can look past the minor issues. I will definitely be ordering again if mine ever break. I've been using them heavily for 6 months and they look and work as good as the day I bought them.

These are popular because of the quality. My fiance bought them first and as soon as I tried his, I bought mine immediately. I let a couple of friends listen to mine, and they went home and bought them. They let their friend listen, and he bought some too. That sort of thing can tell you a lot about just how amazing these are.

I absolutely recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I do have one small complaint.. not meant to be jumped around with and used.. they have great padding on the ears and don’t hurt anything. That being said they don’t stay on the head well..

That actually concerned me a bit at first, because a lot of the best looking headphones just really are mostly hype. That is definitely not the case with these ones they are quality built and sturdy. The battery life seems pretty decent, and I haven’t had the issue of them dying on me as yet; however, I'm a fairly new owner. They’re also quite comfortable. They are also pretty lightweight, so they don’t end up feeling heavy on your head, I have that issue with a lot of brands. Another plus for these headphones. On the topic of comfort, these feature swiveling ear cups. I didn’t realize how important these were for comfort until I owned these. Little minor adjustments that you make while wearing these from time to time definitely help for wearing these over long periods. I don’t think I’ll ever own a pair that doesn’t have this feature. All in all, this headset is classy, stylish and functional from an aesthetic and feature standpoint.

That being said, I put these on today and I was amazed.  My cubicle has progressively gotten more noisy (I'm next to a call center) and these headphones, while playing music, completely drown out the surrounding noise.  Without music it definitely mutes it, but I can still hear a little of my surroundings - mostly the higher pitch voices.  The sound quality is a lot better than I expected.  They are comfortable (perhaps a little tight on my larger-than-average head), but I do need to adjust the ear pieces every 30 minutes or my ears become annoyed.

I fly 130,000 miles every year, now I don't have to worry about leaving expensive headphones or breaking them by accident.

To be clear, I'm reviewing COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones  I'm adding the identity of these phones, since they offer other models and sometimes irrefutable people will steal a competitor's reviews.
So... #1, the noise cancelation feature works wonderfully. I can barely hear anything in my environment (including my husband cheering his team on TV. Yay!)  2. I'm most impressed with the high fidelity sound of these phones. GREAT bass and fabulous clarity in my music or audio books. #3, The price was great also and I think these earphones are every bit as good as the ones that cost 2 or 3 more (I paid around $60 btw)

The active noise cancelling is very good, also, easily overcoming the noise at the unfashionable end of a 777.  But the main thing is they sound amazing!!  The ANC does lessen the depth of the sound a little, but not to the point that they sound bad.  They come with a cool pleather bag, too.

Cons:  Well, con.  They look a little bit bling for my taste.  Too much fake chrome for my liking and the flashy light during operation reminds me of the kind of thing sold at a convenience store.  However, I can't see them while I am using them and everyone who knows me already knows I am totally uncool, and anyone that doesn't know me can go forth and multiply if they are going to judge me on a pair of headphones.  Would rather a nice, plain matt black with a more discrete LED.

One set broke almost instantly, those are not available in Amazon anymore. The other set is the headband style, fun but not great sound. The Cowin e7 was impressive, so much so that I have ordered 2 more, not because I fear them breaking but because I wanted the color options for outfits.

It paired easily and effortlessly.  Sound quality was very high and with the Noise Cancelling Function operating I could use my riding lawnmower and listen to Podcasts and not even turn the volume all the way up.  I was so pleased I had started to toy with the idea of buying a second pair so I had one for home and one for work.  They were working great until I turned off my BT on my iPhone 7 without disconnecting the headset first.  Since then they do not work.  I toggle the switch back and forth but they never make the tone to let me know they are coming on or pairing to my device.  According to Amazon I was eligible for support until July 1, 2019 and it is July 3, 2019 that this happened.  Planned obsolescence?  If there was a reset button or reset directions and I could get them to operate again I would be once again very happy with them.

Update: I turned the switch to noise cancelling and left them to sit until the battery died.  Took 4 or 5 days. Charged them back up and they worked normally.  I am still very pleased with the product.  The only issue I have is there is not a reset function and this would be especially helpful with a product that doesn’t like to be abruptly unpaired with devices.

Update 2: just died on 7/22/2019.  I turned them off normally and when I went to put them back on they won't even make the first beep or illuminate the noise cancellation LED.

Great sound, design, battery life and blue tooth receiver.

I did alot of research before buying these. Frankly, I was going to treat myself to Bose Comfort 35's because I'm worth it.  :-)  While the Bose 35 has top of the line sound and noise cancelling, Id read that these headphones come pretty close, so I decided to take a chance.  I use headphones all the time, so comfort and battery life were important to me too.  I also Iiked the idea I could break one and still get FOUR more for the price of one Bose 35.  Read that again - FIVE E7s for the price of ONE Q35 so go mow the lawn with them!

PROS:
Sound -  very good, but not perfect.  The bass is decent but not booming, the midrange tends to need a boost, and the highs are very good but tinny to some.  Still, a solid B+ sound for <$.  My Kloss and Inifinitys were A-  while I consider the Bose 35 an A.  A+ exists in wired hifi, but even the Q35 loses to some wired competitors.

Noise Cancelling - excellent.  While not quite a Bose, I can stand by a washer or any droning noise and have it disappear.  Very good and only effects sound quality slightly while simultaneously in active cancelling mode and listening to music.

Bluetooth - better than specs.  I was able to walk 50 feet from my amazon echo before loosing pairing. It also pairs easily with typical blinking blue indicator light when it's searching.  Forced pairing mode is easily accessible on the right ear.

Design - the design is decent.  It's shiny plastic, with stainless steel trim, a little las vegas or whatever you call it.  The plastic, however, is too shiny.  I'll describe that in CONS.

Comfort - given the weight, pretty comfortable.  These are kind of heavy, but the excellent over-the-ear cushions are comfy and not to sweaty. The padded head band is also well constructed.  I wear headphones for up to 8 hours at a time.  These are some of the best.  Others literally hurt the cartilage in my ears after that many hours.  It also hangs on the neck well.

Travel - folds flat, but not like a transformer into a small bundle.  This is still good for putting in a suitcase or flat space.  The travel sack is pretty well made, but like everyone, why not a hard shell case?

Battery Life - excellent.  I have never run out during the day.  Some say 24 hours plus, I don't know if I've gotten there, because I can't remember the last time I charged right now. It's been a while.  So the battery life claims seem legit.

CONS:

Finger Prints On Plastic - the plastic is so shiny that it keeps every finger print.  Given the volume controls on the set, you are guaranteed to always have prints on it.  The manufacturer should really change to a matte plastic, and it would look a little less Las Vegas too. I saw the .cn version on their foreign site and it's a slicker, less shiny design.

Digital Volume Control - I really don't like digital volume controls.  You have to hold it down for some time to get to a certain level.  The old rotary volume dial is so much more convenient.

Power Switch- too small.  It's just hard to find sometimes, and the toggle could have just been made larger. Now this could have been a digital button.

A Little Heavy For Exercise - the band and padding minimalize the weight, so normally I wouldn't have noted the weight.  In fact, this isn't a real CON, just an answer to some false advertising by reviewers saying these are good for exercise.  Real exercise involves sweating, so the pads will get yucky, and real exercise often involves real movement, so heavy headphones are again inappropriate.  Buds are the ONLY thing for strenuous exercise.

SUMMARY:
For the money, these are the best headphones I've owned. I love the overall quality and noise cancelling definitely works - remember that's only for constant droning noise, not voices or other sharp sounds.  The only notable drawbacks are fingerprints, a cumbersome digital volume control, and a tiny power switch - not deal breakers.

If you're on the fence, and the money isn't that much, treat yourself, YOU ARE WORTH IT!

UPDATE 9/1/2017:
I use these alot in the hot tub with my laptop playing movies.  Well it finally fell off my head and floated into the filtration compartment.  It was probably in the water for a good 10 seconds and I thought I was out of luck.  After I dried it out, though, it played like nothing had ever happened.  I'll add water resistant to it's numerous qualities.  That's a big plus for those who want to use these in a spa.  I wouldn't say their for the shower, though.  :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

There is some lag so they are not ideal for gaming. The mic is also mediocre at best.

The noise canceling does a good job with low frequency rumbles, like a car or plane (I haven’t tried with a mower yet but I bet they do well there too). However, people talking, keyboards clicking, anything that isn’t a low rumble, comes through pretty loud and clear.

At the end of the day these aren’t Bose. They’re pretty good for the price, and if noise cancellation of low rumbles is something you need, then I can definitely recommend them. If you’re trying to have some peace in the office, you’ll still hear everyone talking etc. and if you don’t need noise cancellation-you may want to find something else, as you can find better overall headphones in this price range without the noise cancellation feature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They were worth every penny. They compare favorably against most of the more expensive brands for a fraction of the cost. (I own Zedd, Bose, Jabra, Airpods, Beats)

Construction is solid, comfort if excellent, battery life is as good or better than the rest of my headphones.
Bass isn't as heavy as Beats but is still solid, far superior to Bose or Apple and similar to Zedd.
Treble/Highs is better than Beats of Zedd but not as crisp as Bose and is Superior to Airpods and Jabra.

Overall these smoke any of your ear buds by any brand, they are better than any other knock off or 3rd party headphones you will find on Amazon. They keep pace with the major brands but aren't quite at the level of the what the respective brands do best. However they are firmly in the upper middle of the pack and are not deficient anywhere.

Good audio quality in BlueTooth mode
Audio quality degrades in Active-Noise-Cancelling mode (I expected that)
The Active Noise Cancelling was better than I thought it would be.  I tested it with the mower.
I started with active noise cancelling off and set the volume loud enough that I could hear what was going on in my podcast while the mower was on.
Then switched Active Noise Cancelling on - the difference was remarkable.  I was able to turn the volume down quite a bit.
I really only expect to use ANC while mowing and on the rare plane ride.
The full over-ear style yields pretty decent passive noise cancelling without flipping the switch.

Why 4 stars instead of 5?
Buttons.  The +/- button are inverted ... + should be on top and - should be on bottom, but they have it the other way around.
I'm sure I'll get used to it, but they way they have it just seems backward.
Also, why not have an extra set of buttons for volume?

The sound quality of these are fairly decent. The bulk of the headphones can take some getting used to, but overall the ear cushion feels comfortable. The noise cancelling function was about on-par with what I would expect. It diminishes the surrounding noise, doesn't get rid of it. (that is what they are supposed to do)

What irritates me is just over a year of purchasing it, it fell apart. Just past the warranty date. I've attached some pictures to illustrate what I'm talking about.

The swivel design is neat, but the problem with it is─ it breaks. Alright, fine, I can survive by gluing one side of them together, it wouldn't swivel but sure it works. Then the other side broke (for obvious reasons, if one side swivels and the other side does not, well, tension + not being able to move, you do the math.)

I don't want a replacement for this because it would break in the same way. I saw a newer design that they have fixed the issue, but I'm not spending $150 for that. I just want something that gets me through my workouts and is dependable.

I'm very hard to satisfy when it comes to listening to music, so over time I've probably spent a couple of thousand dollars on headphones. Here's what I've learned ... there is no such thing as one headphone for every purpose.

If you're looking for headphones with a lot of bass, you should consider the Cowin E7 Bluetooth headphones. I think it really depends on the type of music that you listen to. I think the Cowin E7 is designed more for dance and party music but they sound good with regular music as well.

I tested the headphones with the sound files on audiocheck and the frequency response is really good. The bass is there but isn't over powerful. Try out the bass shaker test - these headphones reproduce the low frequencies without any problem.

The headphones are also really comfortable to wear. I have no problem wearing these headphones during my commute on the train.The right side of the headphones has the buttons for you to control. You slide the switch to turn on/off the headphones You press up and down to control the volume

Overall, I really like these headphones. Typically, I don't like bass heavy headphones but these are well balanced. They sound great and are well built.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The noise bleed is extremely bad with these. Anything over about half volume on my phone and my neighbors are able to hear my music easily.
I have not experienced this type of bleed with any other over the ear headphones and it makes those good sounding high volumes pretty much unusable unless you are by yourself.

The first pair (the old version) suddenly stopped connecting to Bluetooth about a year and a half after buying them, but in spite of that, I ended up buying this update version. I. Love. Them. I use them a LOT. I'm quite sound sensitive and find nosy environments very stressful, so they make being out in public much, much better. Sound quality is comparable to the Sennheisers I use for my PC (non noise cancelling).

The battery life is great, too; I use them for up to several hours per day and have to charge them maybe once a week. They're comfortable enough to wear for long stretches, which I do. Whatever material covering the padding is easy to wipe clean, which is important during summer when I sweat grossly on them.

As far as durability goes, I've traveled with them many times, meaning they've been shoved into my bag or looped through the top strap, gone through airport security, gotten banged around and worn in just about every condition. They're still good as new.

My only quibble is that I wish their bluetooth connection range was longer. It's maybe 15 feet. I've left my phone on a different floor and had no problems vertically, but I can't get very far away horizontally, which is slightly inconvenient when I'm cleaning the house or whatever. Another VERY minor quibble, which really only matters when I'm traveling, is that they're not very comfortable to lay my head on when I'm trying to sleep on a plane. If the earphones themselves were big enough to fully cover my ears, I'd prefer that.

That said these earphones are very comfortable and provide good sound. Depending on what they are linked to, the sound level can be sub-par but only because of the device that is transmitting the music. My Samsung phone has always sucked at getting a loud sound to anything it bluetooth with or links by cable. So if you experience sub-par sound it is more likely the device and not these headphones. They are lightweight and do an excellent job of encasing the ears to block sounds. Sound is not completely eliminated from entering the headphones but you get a richer music without the outside ambient noises of a/c or electronic humming. Definitely recommend them for price and meeting expectations based on that price. If I wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for the best I would've bought the best.

Sound cancelling is on the weaker side but somewhat effective (probably decent for the price), uses a technique where it plays an underlying frequency to dampen exterior noise. you can still hear most things, just dampened.

The sound quality is ok but, the biggest negative for me was that when turned on, you can't adjust the sound  quality (i.e., treble, bass, concert setting, auditorium, etc.l) from the receiver they're plugged into.  It would have been nice if they just played as regular headphones when not on and then given me the option of using the noise cancelling if wanted.  When using bluetooth and/or noise cancelling, you're going to get sound from these headphones but, you can't make ANY adjustments to it other than volume.  The sound quality isn't bad . . . it's just that I would have liked to have a little more control of it.  If that's not a factor with you, then they're pretty good headphones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sometimes, I can adjust the left side of the head band to get audio to play out of the left speaker, but not before being deafened by very loud static.  For several weeks, there has also been an issue with the power switch, where the unit does not turn on (with a fully charged battery).

This is the first over the ear headset that I have owned. I have to say that full props to Cowin. They are excellent for the price.

How comfortable are they?
Very. Simply put. There's not a lot of head squeeze at all. They have a very soft leather-ish over the head band that does not create pressure. The cushions over the ear are very soft as well. I wore them outside for a few hours while cutting the yard. No head ache or pressure points created while wearing them. Top marks for that.

Bluetooth range?
Well I set my phone on the kitchen counter and walked into my bedroom. approx 30 feet with 2 walls in the way. I still got a signal. It hiccuped once over minute or so but it was very tolerable. I don't know of anyone who would want more out of Bluetooth range.

Sound quality?
To me, they sound pretty good. (These aren't Bose we're talking about or Sony for that matter.) When you max out the volume on your device and the headphones, high bass points do sound distorted. Knocking down the volume a few notches does the trick.

Build quality?
It's mostly plastic and fake leather and padding, but they're very sturdy. The buttons feel like they're decent quality. I do have one beef with the button placement though... The volume rocker. Down turns the volume up, up turns the volume down. Seriously Cowin... What backwards ass world do you think we live in? The included 3.5 mm cable is garbage. You have to fiddle with it to get the sound through just right and then stay completely still. A replacement cable works great though

Functions?
Here's where it gets fishy. On the right side at the bottom you have all of your connections/ports for input. There's a switch that has Off, Bluetooth, and Noise Cancelling. There's also a 3.5 mm Headphone jack. When the headphones are off, they're off. No sound will come though them. Well, the other two options are Bluetooth and Noise cancelling (which is still Bluetooth, just noise cancelling added). When in Bluetooth mode the 3.5 mm headphone jack works but it's still connected to your device. I would suggest adding an ""On"" Option without the Bluetooth receiver turning on. It would extend battery life without someone getting a call on their cell phone and leaping out of their chair from how loud it is.

Noise cancelling?
When listening to music through them, They sound great. There's a lot of noise blocked out with them in just normal listening mode. Switching them into Noise cancelling mode removes most of the bass. Not all of it, but there's significantly more treble and the noise that's cancelled is minimal. I can tell a difference, but you have to make a choice. Listen with bass and hear some of the outside sound, or listen with much lower sound quality and hear slightly less surrounding noise. The choice is up to you.
To add, the noise cancelling does not do well with random noise (kids running through the house doing kids stuff is a great example.) They do very well with constant noise (lawn mower, vacuum cleaner, loud dishwasher, insert random gas/electric appliance/tool here)

TL;DR. You can't argue with the price. Even as standard headphones they're great. The noise cancelling is a bonus. Good build quality. Very comfortable. Good Bluetooth range. Spotty noise cancelling feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I suspect that the ear cups will delaminate sooner than you’d like as they feel like they didn’t use high quality material.

The headphones, though on the heavier side are comfortable for extended wear. The noise cancellation on the other hand is very spotty. It starts out as if the white light of ANC being active, but as soon as it is connected to any sound source like a laptop or tablet, the Noise cancellation light goes to blue and there is no Noise cancellation. At best it is absence of a slight buzz that is otherwise present in ""BT"" setting.

So get it for decent sound, but not for NOISE CANCELLATION. Looks elsewhere for ANC !

UPDATE: After complaining about not so good Noise cancellation on first set, they immediately got in touch with me and apologized and sent me a replacement pair, a much better sounding one.

Perfectly cancels out everyone, gives you music","February 5, 2018","Perfect for the plane, which is why I bought them. To listen to music, through bluetooth on my phone or ipad.  They cancel out noise, they sync with your bluetooth device effortlessly.  I also use them to write with.  I find it helpful to block out all other distractions and play music through these to write anywhere--coffeeshops, home, the plane...

They have a pretty long battery life too.  I used mine for several hours a day before I needed to recharge.

Make sure that the device you want it to sync with is the only one on.  I learned I had to turn the bluetooth OFF of my phone if I wanted it to hook up with my ipad.  It will just pair up with whatever is there--and so you have to pair it specifically.

Bottom line, they are worth every penny and then some. If you're looking for a wireless noise canceling headphone for around $50, these will not disappoint. They come snugly packaged in an elegant box with a carrying pouch, aux cable and charging cord. They feel sturdy and look amazing, as good if not better than any $100+ set. I have worn them almost daily on my 1hr commute and also while I run power tools in my wood shop. The sound is great, and more than meets my needs. The noise cancelling is phenomenal and I can now happily listen to music while I run my table saw, routers and other notoriously loud tools. And they are COMFORTABLE! I have a top of the line gaming headset I use with my computer that I constantly need to adjust after only a short while. The Cowin headset I have worn for 6+hrs solid with no complaints. I have read the negative comments about this headset failing after months or years but I can’t really speak to that.

I’ve kept my original review below this for reference, but I do have some better things to say about this company. I was contacted by the customer service manager from Cowin after they saw my 3-star review (original headline “NOT noise cancelling”. I had already sent the headphones back, but they sent me a pair of the SE7 series for free, which is one step up. The sound quality is good and the noise cancelling is decent. Much better than the originals. Although this doesn’t change my thoughts on this specific pair of headphones(E7), they definitely try very hard to show amazing customer service.

Original review:

Pros: I liked the way these headphones looked. I also was happy with the sound quality and the ease of connecting to devices. Great sound for the price.

Cons: I realized within the first day of using them that they do NOT noise cancel. Even a little bit. It’s only the noise of your music that slightly covers up outside sounds. Other than that, they don’t seem to at all.

I sent them back and ended up buying the Bose Quietcomfort II, which are far more expensive but worth every penny. I wanted to give these a try since they had good reviews.

If you’re simply looking for decent headphones, these are fine. If you want noise cancellation, go with something different.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

That was the best decision I could have made for the money I wanted to spend.  I use them on a daily basis since I retired, everyday at least 4-5 hours a day.  The noise cancelling and sound quality for me can’t be better.  I use them for running power equipment (string trimmer, chain saw, etc.) or just tinkering.  They cut out the equipment noise without having to deafen yourself with music volume high.  The bonus is the being able to take a phone call just with a push of a button.
This is my second set, my last set broke (not sure why) but I can tell you Cowin knocked it out of the park, they replaced them for me.  I described where they broke and asked if I could have done something wrong, I didn’t want to purchase the same set if my use was the issue.  Cowin will always get my business, I have already bragged about their customer service.

Scholz","Great headphones rival those that are three times as much","January 9, 2019","I love these headphones. I prefer an over-the-ear cup and these are a perfect fit. The range on them is quite impressive too, as I can go into the kitchen and leave them on without any dropout.

The materials and finish are OK. The ubiquitous cheap chrome plastic and cheap plastic exterior don't really look horrible on these but I just wish companies would spend the extra few cents and stick with stainless steel or brushed metal chrome instead of this cheap plastic.

One other area of concern was a high-frequency whine that would cut in and out on these. After some trial and error I determined that the battery level was getting low, even though Windows said it was at 70% and I did not get any warnings from the headphones themselves.  After charging for a few hours the sound quality is back to normal and the high frequency whine is gone.

The sound is great, with good bass and nice mid-range and highs. These aren't Bose, and they don't claim to be, but in a blind listening test I bet these headphones would hold their own.

So aside from the cheap plastic and lack of a battery low warning these are great headphones. Perhaps Cowin will someday see the light and use real metal in their headphones - then these would be real Bose killers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Smith","Better than the E7 headphones without noise cancellation","October 30, 2019","I bought these to use for air travel. When we received them we were sufficiently impressed with the sound that we ordered another pair of E7 headphones. Unfortunately I goofed on the order and got a pair of non-noise canceling E7s (I did not realize there was such a thing).  Since we were leaving on a trip in a couple of days we decided to do a side by side comparison and see how much difference the noise cancellation actually makes.

The noise cancellation does make a significant difference. However, the noise cancellation only works in wired mode, not in Bluetooth mode. Secondly the noise cancelation only seems to work if you are playing sound, not when there is silence. While the noise cancellation does not eliminate all of the background noise, it does noticeably reduce the drone of the airplane engines and makes listening to music or a movie on an airplane noticeably better than listening with the E7 headphones that did not have noise cancellation. Since we purchased these headphones specifically for air travel, we will be returning the E7 non-noise cancelling headphones and buying another pair of E7s with noise cancellation.

These headphones seem like a good price/value proposition compared with the Bose headphones (which I have never tried but which everyone seems to agree are much better but more than 5 times the cost of these).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

This model improves the battery life and sound quality of the originals but also loses a bit of thump in their bass. They have a slightly more premium look, but it's mostly cosmetic, as their design and overall performance do not change much. They're a decent and affordable option for commuting but aren't the most durable or comfortable headphones in their price range. the plastic used for the ear cups feels low grade and a bit flimsy. They won't break from a few falls, but the ear cups and hinges do not feel as durable as some of the other budget headphones. They have a consistent, balanced, and punchy bass, a good and relatively balanced treble, and great imaging. However, they lack a bit of sub-bass so they can't produce a lot of thump and rumble, and their mid-range tends to sound thin and honky, especially on vocals. Additionally, their treble may sound a bit sharp on S and Ts, and like most other headphones, they don't have a speaker-like soundstage. They cancel enough ambient noise to use for regular commutes especially when playing your music at moderate to loud volumes. They also do not leak as much as much as some of the other closed-back over-ears, which make them an above-average option to use in quieter conditions. However, at high enough volumes, they will be audible to the people around you, and their somewhat decent isolation won't be enough for particularly noisy environments. The integrated microphone of the Cowin E7  is sub-par. In quiet environments, speech recorded or transmitted with this mic will sound relatively thin and noticeably muffled and lacking in detail. It may also sound a bit unnatural and difficult to understand. In noisy situations, it will struggle to fully separate speech from background noise, even in moderately loud places, like a busy street.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Having said that, these do a good job, and generally I find that there are few situations where the excess noise isn't drowned out. If you're colleagues are so obnoxious that you can hear them through the music, a conversation is warranted over solving the problem by technology proxy.

For phone calls, I've found that the audio is garbled and terrible when using bluetooth; this is possibly just how bluetooth phone calls work? Not sure. Using the included audio cable and turning off the bluetooth allows using the headphones to be used for a call without encountering this issue, but when a call comes in and you're already listening via bluetooth, it's kinda too late for that. Best option if a call comes in while you're listening via bluetooth is to turn off the headphones and answer with the handset. Not sure if every phone has this issue, but I tested on a sony xperia and a note 4 and I wouldn't think I'd see the exact same problem across such diverse hardware.

The case that comes with the headphones is soft and won't protect them at all. There's a case you can buy from Cowin - it's inexpensive, but why not just include it, Cowin?

The battery life is great and I have no issues listening all day at work and on both sides of a nearly 1 hour commute.

6. They connect to my game counsel and sound better than my turtle beach headset.
7. They come well packaged along with some goodies you can see in the photos that go for a good cause.
8. The noise cancellation isn't overbearing when turned on with no music. When turned on with music, it's over with. No noise will get through unless it's obviously very very loud. That's with any NC Headphone feature.

These are excellent. Lightweight, comfy, easy to figure out, long lasting charge, easy to Bluetooth with my Samsung android phone and a great value.

And the noise cancelling feature blows me away.

I first just put them on, straight from the package, sitting on my couch. They weren't plugged in to anything or charged but suddenly the sounds from kids playing outside disappeared.

I got them for work and I'm no longer slowly losing my mind and grinding my teeth over the senseless chatter from people sitting around me.  Finally I can concentrate.

Linda who sings and hums and sounds like a cat in a blender. Gone.

Tammy who didn't get enough attention as a child and is emotionally stunted at age 7.

They are VERY comfortable. I know they're on me but they're not imposing. I wear glasses and after an hour or so with them on my ears don't feel pinched. This is a big deal - I've had too many headphones that make my ears sore while wearing glasses.

There's times when I'll leave them on, not listening to anything while I'm studying a book. The noise cancelling helps bring the distractions around me to a minimum.

Apparently there's a newer rendition of these headphones. I bought these even though they were a model out from being the newest. That being said they're an incredible bargain for the price.

I definitely recommend these.

Give BOSE credit for a great idea but the ""concept"" is well out of the barn! These phones sound great, are very comfortable to wear, 30 hour play time and if you do manage to run down the batt. just plug them in to the wired input to connect the phones to the player and keep listening.
As I tried to quickly discuss in the video the fit and comfort of these phones will vary with different size and shape heads so you'll just have to try them on. (think shoes) As far as sound, I am a retired professional studio musician, trumpet player, and I've used headphones that would sell for around $5,000 at today's prices, so let's not go crazy comparing apples & oranges! At $70 these are a great deal and you should be satisfied with the sound and comfort at this price. It's worth the extra $10 to buy these, with the noise cancelling feature, for 2 reasons. The noise cancel works very well, plus you get the choice of 2 E.Q. settings when you switch from B.T. to N.C. As HAWAIIANS would say, ""CHANCE UM""!! Product received for professional evaluation. OH, one more thing, I failed to mention if you get too far from the transmitter and start to lose the signal make sure to turn you head so the receiver (in the ear piece with the volume and on and off button) is facing in the direction of the signal. Any B.T. device with two separate pieces will have the receiver in one piece and the batt. in the other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Now, I feel bad only using it for work and not at home too... So, either tote this around or buy another one. I'm going to buy another one. Well worth it.

Sound: I tend to listen to hard metal so it's more at a higher range, but some of them have bass and it sound really great coming through these headphones. I have not tried them on a call yet, but I can't wait to see how that works out.

Comfort: I wear glasses, so like most over the ear headphones, they press the arms against my ears. BUT, not enough to make it uncomfortable. If you think about it, you will feel some discomfort.

Hardware: The quality look and feel of these headphone is above par.. They look at feel like they are designed and built with Comfort in mind, but they sure look good too!

Friend of mine at work bought a pair of Bose and I got these. We traded and he was REALLY impressed with what he was hearing out of these for the price. He is going to take his Bose home and buy a pair of these for work and one for his car (which reminds me that I might want 2 more).

The weight and the fact that it's not as comfortable as I'd like were factors too.

They are my first non-earbud headphones, and I got them because I work in a very busy active office and needed a way to drown out noise and get things done.  They are perfect, the noise cancelling on them is so good that while I am wearing them people are calling my name and I dont even hear them, even without music.  They are so good in fact that I forget I am in a room full of people sometimes and I started singing and dancing and people laugh (or dance with me haha).  The noise cancelling when the music isnt on is fantastic too, it seriously takes out all that white noise ( you know the background stuff like the headers running, the lights buzzing, etc.) you hear in a room and feels like it protects my ears and reduces headaches from that noise.  No one hears my music, I am proctor exams the past few days and put these on to watch some movies, and no one hears anything even in a superbly quiet room.  I am intrigued by the bose, but not by the price ($350 for headphones???? yikes).

These E7 Noise Cancelling Headphones have been so comfy, easy, and convenient to use ever since the first day I took it out the box and started using them. They are pretty much my dream headphones I wanted to have when I relax, listen to music, watch TV, play video games, or even lie down (well on my back because the headphones are pretty big).

Now I'll be honest, I felt very skeptical at first when getting these because they were going to be the most expensive wireless headphones I ever bought at the time, and I didn't wanted to become upset that I'm basically buying Beats headphones. But these $67 headphones that are capable of rechargeable noise cancelling, the most comfortable ear cushions ever, and a pretty long battery life shown me that they are most definitely worthy to buy!

Just one teensy little problem though, you can't switch from NC back to BT on the headphones without turning them off first (which annoys the hell out of me when I'm listening to a playlist.)

Overall, you get what you paid for and in this case, some Faithful excellent headphones!

EDIT: 5/13/2019
They're still working really good for me after a year! Unfortunately, I can't use the aux cable to it no more, and the headphone's ears had long almost fell off. Nothing that super glue can fix though! Also, battery life is just as same as it was when I first bought it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

They sound fantastic!  The ANC is acceptable.  However, I purchased them for all that and the ability to use the microphone for web conferences, via Bluetooth.

There, this product falls terribly flat!  The microphone sound quality has been described as ""flat and muffled"", barely audible"" ""distracting"" and so on.  I had someone try them while I listened to the microphone and I was embarrassed to have used them for work.

Additionally, the Bluetooth range is a whopping six feet.  I occasionally hear a buzzing sound if I move beyond that or the connection simply drops.  I can walk all around my house with the $20 pair of Bonitones; https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DYSKWEO/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 .  They just become uncomfortable after extended use.  So I was looking for something over the ear comfortable and functional, in all the aspects I required.

They fit, look and sound great; just don't rely on the microphone and do not move more than a hair's breadth away from your BT device. I hope I can still return them to Amazon and get something else. Otherwise, I am stuck with a headset that was almost great.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The active noise cancellation is pretty decent although not incredible; I mostly use it when using machinery, like mowing. It blocks out quite a bit of the noise but I have to turn up my music quite loud to hear it which sort of defeats the purpose of the noise cancelling. The quality of the sound is pretty decent, certainly good enough for enjoying music whilst doing chores (I am a recording engineer so I have professional headphones to which I compare them as far as sound quality). The fit is good and doesn't make my ears too terribly hot (but pretty warm). Build quality is quite good. I do not use the Bluetooth feature so cannot comment on that, I use the 1/8 inch input.

As soon as you put the headphones on it’s like you entered a concert. You don’t hear anything but the music. The Bluetooth allows you to be mobile with your headphones without the hassle of extra wiring. The battery life itself is on another level. I haven’t had to charge my headphones much since receiving them a couple days ago so that’s great for long workouts, trips, or whatever else you like to get into while accompanied by music.

The seller was great in working with me on the fit and feel.  I got another pair and they seem to adjust better then the first pair so maybe they made a slight design change. Either way they are more comfortable than the first pair.

Not bad.  I was looking for an inexpensive but nice sounding wireless headphone and these are just that  I use them with my Ipod when I'm mowing the lawn or just somewhere where having a cord is bothersome.  I was really hoping I would use these during workouts but no way.  They aren't very comfortable if you need to adjust them to a tighter fit - they hurt my ears - and once you start sweating they start slipping.  The sound is not terrible but probably not as good as a $50 pair of earbuds. The noise cancelation is really good and they get good use on the airplane.

There was also random noise in the left ear piece, especially when the noise cancelling mode was on. Not sure what to do, I used Amazon's contact link to write to the seller, Cowin.

Huber","Fine, but not great","September 27, 2019","These were a replacement for my Sennheiser HD 202 over the ears that had a wire break after years of service.  My main complaint for the COWIN E7 is due to them being used in the office environment.  The 202's had great quality sound and could be played at fully volume without having any bleed-thru sound heard by my coworkers.  After a couple days, I had notice the COWIN E7 could only be played at 45-65% before being heard by coworkers.  If played above 75%, nearby staff could hear the lyrics pretty clearly--despite having a tight seal around my ears.  (And there is no hair to get in the way due to having a shaved head.)  I also tried different orientations to block the bleed through sound, but it appears to be a limitation of this product.  I like that it is wireless so will use these at home, and repurchase a pair of wired Sennheiser HD 202 II for work....","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Are they perfect? Not at all. Are they worth 60 bucks? I think so.

PROS:
- Did I mention these cost 60 bucks? The ""nice"" headphones can but upwards of 200 dollars.
- Battery life is great at 20+ hours
- Sound quality is more than adequate (not that I own nice speakers or headphones though)

CONS:
- Noise canceling is not very effective. Mostly just removes low frequency sounds around you. Although the seal of the headphones does block a decent amount of noise on its own.
- Controls are horrible. Up for down? Down for up? Press to skip and hold for volume? What?!?
- They aren't very loud, I have to turn my phone volume to 75% or higher to hear them on the freeway. Maybe that's typical for BT headphones though?
- The power switch on my headphones has gotten very sensitive, pushing the switch when the headphones are off can cause them to turn on, even though the switch doesn't slide to ""On"".

I preferred listening to speakers rather than having something on my head or in my ears. When I needed them, like on a flight, I was satisfied with anything except the cheapest earbuds. However, with a big trip coming up, I decided to invest a minimal amount on these E7 headphones. What a difference! They're comfortable and, to me, they sound great (at least in Noise Cancelling mode - more about that later). For the first time in years I'll sit with headphones on and immerse myself in the music.

Next, the true test. My wife is an audiophile. I can't tell you how many pairs of earbuds/headphones she's been through, with the Bose noise cancelling cans being her preference. I invited her to try the E7s. Although she still deemed the Bose cleaner and crisper in the mids and highs, it was only after side by side comparison - playing the same section of music repeatedly while swapping between the headphones. They were that close. Certainly an impressive performance for headphones 1/6 the cost of the Bose.

There are some caveats. The E7 construction is decent but mostly plastic.  Pleather earpads instead of leather. Finally: sound quality in Noise Cancelling vs Bluetooth only. With the switch in the BT position the sound quality of the E7s is very unbalanced with heavy distorted bass overpowering everything. But, switch to noise cancelling and the sound balances out nicely for a very nice listening experience.

I can't speak much to battery life or durability since I a just got them but overall an excellent value for the money so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

While the sony phones had a decent enough sound for the price, they were terribly uncomfortable on my ear. My right ear actually hurt after wearing the sony phones while I exercised for any hour. The reviews on he E-7 were very good and when I listened to them the first time I knew why. The sound quality of the E-7 is far superior to the
Sony MDRZX220BT/B. The Cowin phones were a buck more. I prefer the controls on the Cowin phones over the Sony (on the side of the phones instead of the bottom.) As far as the comfort on my ears go, these phones are much more comfortable than the Sony, although my right ear does twing a bit after an hour but nothing like the sony. Right ear has always given me a problem anyway with wearing glasses, so its probably just me. The only negative about the cowins is they are slightly heavier than the sony but not enough to drop the rating by a star. These phones are well worth the money. Paring was easy and quick (I'm using an old Nokia windows phone as my mp3 music player to be able to have the bluetooth functionality). I've only been using these for a week so can't say how long the battery charge will last, but plan on running them dry to determine how long the charge will last. Can switch to the the supplied audio cable when it runs out. Another plus, the sonys did not have an audio jack, so bluetooth was the only option for those..","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I gave them to my wife and as of 7-24-17 received the cowin noise canceling headphones and I have to say they are better built then bose and sound just as good. If you want to get the full experience of these play ""No ordinary love"" by Sade at 1/2 to 3/4 of the way turned up and you will see that these are the best you can get. You get bass, highs, lows and vocals at a perfect level. All that with NC off as you lose some of the range but you don't need it as it already has it as soon as you put them on your ear. Not just for the price, but any price. I was a bose man until they got a short in the cord in 3 months and way over priced. I give my seal of approval on these and will have to buy another pair.

Bluetooth doesn't work, noise cancelling is weak.","June 19, 2019","I bought these ""noise cancelling"" headphones for plane trips and my daily train commute. At no time have they cancelled any significant portion of the noise I am hearing. Pairing them is a problem; they seem to ""forget"" my iPhone and other mobile devices. Worst of all, when paired with some devices, the playback of music is stuttering, staccato-like. I can't recommend them.

ETA: The Bluetooth playback is a joke. When I plug an audio cord directly into the phones, the sound is lush and lovely. The bass is deep and rich. But if I attempt to use these as wireless headphones, I get nothing but static and staccato playback. I have gone through every forum, tried every solution, and my conclusion is that Cowin just does not know how to write Bluetooth software. Again, the wired playback is fantastic, but don't bother trying to use the Bluetooth or noise cancelling features.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But for mowing the lawn I'm using the old Bose again. These aren't nearly as good at noise cancelling, and it's hard to hear a podcast over the noise of the mower.

Update:  Was contacted by the seller who suggested I try the E8 model for Bose-level noise suppression.  The E8s have replaced my corded Bose for mowing the lawn - very good noise cancellation against a very loud mower.  Warning: the E8s are huge.

Old Review:
This is a nice set of headphones my 3 star rating is based on the Noise Cancelling feature, which is the primary reason I bought them.  I bought them to wear at work to help decrease the noise from co-workers.  With the headphones set on noise cancelling I can still hear a coworker in another room no where near me sorting paper.  I can hear her flip the sheets of paper!  This noise doesn't bother me, I'm just using it as an example of how the noise cancelling feature does not work well.  It seems to eliminate white noise such as a fan running but does almost nothing for the noise I want to cancel.  I can even hear my coworker 6 feet away eating crackers.  So not the Noise cancelling feature DOES NOT WORK.  On the pro side the head phones are very comfortable and the sound quality of music is good and the blue tooth connection was super easy.  These features are the only reason I even give them 3 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They fit great, they sounded good, construction seemed a bit flimsy, but overall I was happy with them. They held a good charge. I could go to the gym multiple times through out the week with out having to charge them in between.

Fast forward to the end of May (4 months later), now they wont turn on. Thought the battery was dead, no biggie. I threw them on the charger and went about my day. Went to the gym a few days later, and same thing.... they would not turn on. When I went home I plugged them in and they would turn on, but as soon as I would unplug them they would turn off.

I am assuming the battery is just faulty. Overall I was happy with the product, 4 stars. I cant give them 4 stars when I only got to use them for 4 months. Going to try to get a hold of the company to see if they can assist me. Maybe they can even swap them. Will update, and maybe change rating with customer service.

**UPDATE**
I sent Cowin an email. They got back to me within a few hours. I was actually surprised, as it was a Friday. They gave me a coupon to use on amazon that took care of 99% of the cost of the new pair of headphones.

They paired up extremely easily, the sound quality is as good if not better than my middle of the road Sony headphones that these will replace .  In the pictures the Sony headphones are on the bottom and the new headphones are on the top. I paid more for the Sony’s which have no Bluetooth yet the build quality feels better On the  Cowin set. The headband is definitely built better and a softer material with more padding . The ear cups Are slightly larger than the Sony and my ears fit much better inside. Battery life : I cannot speak up about past five or six hours because that’s all I have use them so far but they have been perfect in that respect but I cannot speak to the fact as to how long the batteries will last beyond six hours. The noise canceling switch makes a tremendous difference and I feel the noise canceling is on par with the Sony it did a great job of eliminating  90% of the noise from the south west 737.  Bases very strong when compared to the Sony, actually outshined them considerably, mid range is fine highs are nice and crisp.

Very satisfied.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I'll preface this review with the fact that I have an XXL head., and I have not tested the battery (I've never used it more than 4 hours straight without charging).

Pros:
1. The noise cancelling on this is 100% great. I went from being bothered and distracted by constant office noise to being in my own sanctum of music and focus purely generated by these headphones. I wear glasses with these and I still experience excellence. I have compared them in a VERY loud Best Buy with top-of-the-line A.N.C. headphones from Bose, Beats, and Sony. The difference in noise cancelling was impossible to determine from a casual non-scientific experience.

2. I am no audiophile but I find this to be excellent music quality. At my test in Best Buy I could say that it's inferior to the $300 Bose, but come on.

Cons:
1: At first it required adjustment every few hours at first to un-pinch whatever part of my ear they're resting on and it eventually becomes annoying by the end of my 8 hour work day at a desk. Again, I have an XXL head and L ears. The
average XL hat does not even fit on my head. However, it stretched out over the first month of ownership.

2. The button placement and programming are kind of awkward. Volume up is the down button, long press. Quick press the volume up button for next song. I somehow accidentally double-tapped it and called someone. I've gotten used to it but...weird.

3:  For some strange reason, unlike most circumaural headphones I've owned, these are very awkward to put around my neck. Clearly docking 3 stars for that issue","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I find the difference in many sound output devices to be in the creation of a sound stage or presence that one senses envelops them in an expansive sensation, with highs, lows and a sense of being ""in the soundfield"".  These headphones are very good, but the sound stage is simply not there for me.  Technically, they deliver 20 - 20,000 Hz sensitivity and the output in volume is very good, it's just that the sound quality seems ""focused"" rather than ""expansive"", a little muddied rather than crystal clear.  Perhaps those elusive qualities just can't be had for the price point that these are in.  I don't mean to mislead someone looking for solid-performing and very solidly built high-value phones.....that's the niche that these fall into.  The only other mild gripe that I have is that they don't fit around the ears.  I always interpreted ""over ear"" to mean ""around ear"" headphones, and ""on ear"" to mean they rest on the ear itself.  Now, I'm finding that ""over ear"" seems to be interpreted by manufacturers to mean ""mostly around but also resting partially on the ear.  I think it's misleading to describe this ""hybrid"" placement as ""over-ear"" headphones.  I've got small to average sized ears, and these will not fit ""around"" my ears, but sit both on and off the ears, touching the lower lobe of the ears.  Still, they are comfortable to wear, just not as completely comfortable as ""around the ear"" sized earcup designs.  The materials overall appear very nice, super-smooth to the touch, like a fine auto finish or a grand piano.  the ear pad feels smooth and nice.  The spring-loaded pressure against the head is a little too strong for my taste, but just so.  The sound-cancelling feature works very well, the sense of ""isolation"" from the environment is definitely part of the experience as well.  Overall, there's lots to like about these nicely built and good performing phones, and I think they represent a very solid overall ""value"" proposition to the potential buyer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I bought these as I have started flying frequently and disliked having to put my headphone volume at max to drown out the engine roar.  On the first use, I put them on before takeoff and started listening to music.  Once in the air, I took them off to talk to someone and was astounded how much these headphones had been blocking out the engine roar.  Made these well worth the money.  Sound quality is good, bass response is good, overall very happy with these.  My only complaint and reason I didn’t rate them at 5 stars, is that when I turned my head I would get a hard “thumping” sound.  I’d take the headphones off and put them back on again to make the thumping go away, but had to do this a few times during each flight when the thumping returned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Not only well worth the money, but I've been converted from Beats to these. Absolutely would recommend these.

The sound quality is crisp and enjoyable, trust me when I say the noise cancelling version is worth the extra money. If you're a fan of softer music like score or jazz and hate that you can't listen to it well in public, that mode helps quite well with it. The design is comfortable and fits snugly on the head. The ear padding is fairly well set and actually feels like it breathes a little, so not a lot of worry for sweat from that area. Headband is snug, and the entire structure of it feels sturdy. Sure, it doesn't bend, but the rotating cuffs work well also. Just take note that because of the design, you may not even need to turn on the sound cancelling to even mute outside noise. The design naturally does a little of that already, so the sound cancelling is a little bit extra.

The one things I have to say against this is because of how sound the design is, it tends to weigh a tad bit on the head after several hours of use, leading to slightly sore ears and the top of the head. However, these are due moreso to the pressure and go away after a little bit of time.

There is another thing that I should point out. Eventually, I picked up a gentle rattling noise on the normal on setting that ends with a pop after you stop playing music, and the noise cancelling mode has a gentle hissing sound, which I suppose is the noise-cancelling. The gentle rattling noise is annoying at times, so it's best to not keep your headphones on while your music is paused.

Honestly well worth your money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The first one was a very small space in which our misguided CTO thought it would be cool and productive to fit as many people as possible. He was loud and kind of dorky and pretty much the main reason I had for buying these headphones. I couldn't swing a more expensive pair, so I went with these, based on the good reviews I'd read.

In a small room with a Loud Howard type, I don't think earplugs or any noise canceling headphones could totally block out ambient noise (ridiculously talking about every. single. thing). These did help somewhat to dampen the volume of the incessant conversations happening around me.

Now I'm in a different environment with cubicles. Not totally sequestered, but segmented in 3-sided cubicles and slightly more private. Here, these headphones are pretty wonderful. I can almost completely tune out from other folks' conversations, and sometimes people have to nudge the back of my chair to even get my attention.

They are pretty comfortable. I don't have a freakishly large head and I can wear these for a couple hours at a time. Then I give my ears a bit of a rest for a few minutes before putting them back on.

The battery life is pretty amazing. I have yet to run the battery down, but I put the headphones on a charger pretty much every evening when it's time to go home.

I would buy these again. And I might... then I could have a pair at home, as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

(I can’t even tell if it’s working or not) battery life is SUPERB!, sound is really good, however using these as a microphone/phone device is kinda like talking to yourself with earplugs on. You can’t hear yourself speaking very well when talking on the phone to someone else. It’s like your own voice is muffled. But the end users that have reported back to me said ‘it sounds like we are in the same room! Sounds great’. So microphone quality is excellent. The earpieces are a little too floppy and the size of these fit too loose on my head. Their more for a person with a giant melon. Lol. So don’t try to work out with these on - you’ll need a bungee cord wrapped around them to keep them on like if your running or something.

They are a reasonable purchase if you want the wireless feature without having to spend hundreds on Bose or Beats headphones. Pros: Very comfortable, great battery life, decent volume, they have a cool sleek look, and I LOVE the wireless feature, as I work out ALOT, and I don't have to bother with a cord. However, I was really disappointed with the bass quality. They are advertised as having clear and deep bass, and I would describe it as very mediocre as far as bass goes. I've purchased Skull Candy headphones for $15 that have far superior bass quality. Over all, the volume and sound is good. As for the noise canceling feature, I don't find it makes any difference at all. Just having over the ear headphones blocks out some background noise. Also, as I mentioned earlier, I work out ALOT. I would not recommend these for cardio related workouts, because they slide constantly. They're ok for weight lifting though! Lastly, they are very fragile, the headband part is already bent and I've only had them for a couple of weeks.

It can slightly lower high db noise, but it is really not worth the price you paid. The phone doesn't turn off automatically if the Bluetooth is not connected, or if it is connected but no music is played. The buttons are very inconvenient location.

It's been more than a year since I left this review, and the seller is STILL sending me emails asking me to lie and give it a positive review. As a result I am downgrading this from 2 stars to 1 star. Steer clear.

Previous title: White noise is gone, but that just makes people talking more noticeable.

This is my first pair of noise-cancelling headphones, so maybe I'm expecting too much, but they only seem to cancel white noise.

I can't hear the air conditioning anymore, which is nice, but I was really hoping to tune out the noise of people talking in my open office setup, and that's not happening. Voices a little quieter than they are without the headphones, but ironically, being unable to hear the air conditioner makes their voices more distracting, as the white noise of the air conditioner had a masking effect.

The sound quality is a little tinny, and the bass lacks depth, but it's well within my expectations for the cheapest pair of noise-cancelling headphones I could find.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Watched a video here and YouTube that stated they were worth purchasing. When I opened the box which was encased in plastic, the ear cups had dirt on them and there were smudges. Unless the dirt fairy unleashed its wrath, these belonged to someone else. A bit bummed about no hard case just a soft bag to place the headphones in. I keep them in the box they arrived in doesn't take up much more than my previous headphones. They are okay for now hopefully they'll last me until Christmas. So I can ask Santa for the pair I truly want.

Pros
Metal frame
Noise canceling (doesn't completely block out sound, but it's good with music, movie, & etc)
Charge lasts all day for Bluetooth

Cons
Quality Sound (if you're looking for bass, look elsewhere)
Ear cups twist, pressing into your face (they should snap into place, Cowin might want to look into that)

****Update****
Received a surprise on Monday, there was another pair of headphones waiting for me even though I had not contacted customer service. I have to say these headphones were better. The earcups were clean with no smudges! They still move a bit, but they don't dig into my face which is great. The sound quality improved on the new set so I am assuming the headphones I purchased were defected. Yet the sound quality is not where it should be. At the same time, I am very particular when it comes to my music. I want to hear all the instruments, the beats, the breaths, and the vocals, at times it sounds like background noise instead of being apart of the song. I prefer the sound to be clean and crisp as if I am in a recording studio. The Pros and Cons remain the same except I will add customer service to the Pros.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I cannot recommend a product that breaks without cause and has no customer support. Very disappointed with my purchase.

After writing this review, I heard back from an inquiry I submitted through Amazon. I am getting a new set of headphones tonight, for free. No hassle or long surveys.

One year later and I am still in love with these! The sound quality is fantastic, they look sleek and aesthetic, and Bluetooth syncing is never a problem. The product also comes with a good carrying bag, charger, and audio cable. Highly recommend a pair for all those trying to ball on a budget! You will not regret it!

Update (1 year 2 months later): SO SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED with these...I was listening to some casual nighttime jazz while writing an email when I heard a cracking sound. Lo' and behold I found the ear module detached from the overhead component. Don't buy these if you are looking for a durable pair of headphones. As I look back at what I said in my initial review, I realize these aren't the most affordable headphones on the internet so I take that back. They break so they're clearly not reliable. Quality was great until AGAIN: they broke! Hard to appreciate sound quality when you can't put the headphones on your head. Sleek/Aesthetic? Yes, I'm bitter so yeah, I've seen better-looking headphones. I do NOT recommend a pair because you will neither be balling nor on a budget when you end up as flabbergasted as I am.

Why would you not spend a little time making sure the overarching piece is securely holding the earpieces?? Poor engineering.

The Bluetooth connection is lightning quick, solid battery life, super comfortable, and the noise cancelling feature is awesome. The quality of the sound is a bit less than what I'd like it to be, though, and feels like they have the bass turned up while the treble and melody falls into the background. It creates a sort of echo that I'm not over the moon about, but gets the job done if your commute is short enough to not really mind it for half an hour twice a day. The buttons are also pretty weird and don't make any sense (the volume up is on the bottom rather than top, and you also have to long press to increase the volume as opposed to short tap to skip to the next song. You'll definitely mess it up the first few times), but after using it for less than a day I'm already used to it.

They're relatively comfortable, which is good because I use them primarily in bed at night. They adjust well, and each earpiece tilts independently, allowing you to make them sit well. While there is a fair amount of padding on the bar that sits on your head, they would definitely be more comfortable with more.

The sound is pretty darn good, with decent bass as well as upper notes - after I adjusted the sound quality and effects in my phone and my tablet.

The down side? There are actually three:

1.  There's really no noise-canceling effect. I chose noise canceling to cover my husband's snoring. While he's only a mild - moderate snorer, this set doesn't have any advantage over my old set, or even my earbuds.

2.  The controls are in a triangular gizmo on one side. It's very difficult to tell where to press to do what. The nearly-identical triangle on the opposite side doesn't feel any different.

3.  The controlling triangle flashes a pretty bright blue light. That's only an issue if you're using them in the dark - which I am. It actually tricks my eye every so often to look for what moved in the bedroom.

And that's the basis of my 3-star rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I can wear them for 10 hours straight, and barely get any fatigue. It's unreal how comfortable they are. I fly frequently for work, and didn't feel like dropping $300-ish on a set of Bose, and was intrigued by the low price with the supposed 30-hour battery life.

Let's talk about that battery life. I haven't completely cataloged how long that battery lasts, but it lasts at least a full traveling day, so at least 18 hours.  That is impressive.

Also impressive is the nose cancelling. At this price point, you usually run into a lot of pretty gimmicky stuff where it's not actually active noise cancellation. I'm here to tell you that when you get on a plane, and the jet engine fire up and start to roar, and you flip that switch, that roar goes almost completely away to a whisper. Is it as completely isolated of an environment as the Bose will give you? No, not at all. But these are darn good.

Downsides? There are a couple.
-Audio quality. These will not thump your ears with gobs of base, and they are not audiophile quality. To me, they are more than sufficient for kicking back with a movie inflight or listening to some tunes.
- Controls. The direction of the buttons are backwards of what you would think they are in two ways: short Up press skips backwards ( normally you would expect that to increase volume) and long Up press decreases volume (you would expect that to skip forwards). The inverse is true for the other way.
- Large cans. While these are very comfortable to wear while awake, it can be a bit difficult to get comfortable to sleep due to the size of the ear cups. But honestly, it's not too bad.
- Wired connection. This one upsets me a bit. I bought these partially due to the fact that you can operate them with an auxiliary cable if you want to. I assumed (apparently) incorrectly that this means that they can be used when the battery runs out in a wired fashion. This is not true. Just be aware of this.

Taking the above cons into account, I have no qualms about wholeheartedly recommending these headphones to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

First of all, some outstanding qualities: They are extremely comfortable. I wore them all day even when I was not using them just because I forgot I had them on. Second, the battery life is excellent. I purposely left them on the whole day I was away from my house. They lasted at least 14 hours before I put them on the charger for the night and were still going strong.

Now for the more nuanced qualities. The Active Noise Canceling is plenty sufficient for listening to podcasts and music on the train and the subway. While it is not exquisite like the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II or the Sony WH1000XM3, it certainly does enough to allow you to turn the volume down a bit and to hear over the ambient noise of subways, trains, and traffic. If you are around some loud, low rumbling, like the engine of the train as it passes you, these headphones simply can't reproduce such vibrations. So, you will find your listening experience swamped by such noises. I suspect, though, that the more expensive phones would be hard pressed to filter out such noises as well.

One area in which the ANC seems to fail is when you are seated on a bus and travelling down bumpy roads. The bumps and thrashes are low enough and impactful enough to trigger the ANC but the ANC cannot counter such noises. So, you wind up with a lot of noise introduced into the speakers.  In other words, the ANC makes noisy, bumpy rides even noisier as it fails to reproduce the inverse waveform. They sound intermittently staticky.

As for the sound quality, well, I would rate them better than your run-of-the-mill cheap headphones. Not great but not bad. Of course, if your listening to Podcasts, there is no love lost on these. Music however, will sound a little muted or bassey- I am not sure which. I haven't done any direct comparisons to my previous studio-quality wired headphones but it is noticeable. Still, it is definitely not as bad as other cheap headphones I have tried. Plus, I am not sure how much of the sound quality is eaten up by Bluetooth. These are my first BT headphones and I know that BT takes some of the quality away during transmission. I have yet to A/B these using the wired connection versus the BT.

The packaging is compact and stylish. The pouch provided to store them is of decent quality. They look sharp and feel pretty solid despite the plastic housing. The button controls are easy to find and use. All-in-all, I am very happy with these headphones. If I have more to add or to change, I will do so after having used them some more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've been using a Jabra wired open air headphone that doubles for Zoom meetings and it sounded pretty good. I wanted to go wireless to avoid the ""dog at the end of his tether"" phenom when I get up. I've tried various wireless buds (the best being Sony Extra Bass Bluetooth headphones) but they all are uncomfortable after an hour or two plus that's about how long the battery charge lasts. I just got the Cowin E7's yesterday and I'm blown away by the excellent sound of the music through these phones. Even before playing music through them, the over-ear design and noise cancellation knocks down the surrounding chatter to less than a third. They also maintain their charge for 30 hours!

The fit is great and the sound is even better. When I do get a call while in use no one complains that I sound muffled which was the case with other headphones I've had. So I would definitely recommend these headphones so far so good.

Update: I have had these headphones for 3 months using them 4 days a week for 2 hours. And they are not holding up there is static and the sound is spotty they seem loose now I have to keep adjusting them the cushion is a little uncomfortable now those are small things i could have dealt with but when I can't listen to anything without it going out which causes me to have to rewind and listen again I had to get this issue fixed. So I go online to check the warranty and I see that this company has released an upgraded version of the E7 and renamed it E7 pro upgraded and I read the description because just like phone newer models come out but most of the time the numbers change. Reading the description it gives. I read where they have made improvement that match everything that I am having issues with down to the cushion so upon future reading I see there is a 18 month warranty so I figure they would say hey we apologize  that the older version was not reliable as promised in the description we have since improved and upgraded the E7 and fixed those issues we will send the upgraded headphone. THEY DID NO SUCH THING. They wanted to send me the same E7 that is currently having enough issues to warrant improvement and upgrades.  I asked why would I want the same headphone that basically will quit in 3 months when you have the same product that fixed the issues of the first product. Needless to say after 3 days of emailing seller a refund was giving.  I wouldn't recommend any company who would knowingly give its customers a replacement product that is already known for having issues when they know that they have a product where they fixed the issues of the first. these are not 20 dollar headphones I paid over 70 dollars I think that should be taking into account when your product only last 3 months. They refuse because the price for the upgraded version is 20 dollars more so instead of losing 20 dollars they would rather do a refund instead and lose 1 customer and a 5 star review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

- The headphones are extremely confortable. I can wear them for hours and not have any ear pain or pinching.
- Connecting to bluetooth is quick and easy. Unlike some devices, they connect as soon as the bluetooth path is open.
- Noise cancelling is decent for the price.

With all this said, the main gripe has got to be the SKIPPING and STUTTERING that occasionally occurs. This happens even when I have my phone in hand, or i'm using another bluetooth device that's in very close proximity, so i'm sure it's not a distance problem. I learned that this may happen when other devices nearby disrupt the connection, so I've used them at night, with all devices either unplugged or on sleep/stanby mode and it still happens. The skipping can last anywhere from 5 to 15 seconds. This gets extremely annoying, especially when you're listening to something saved on the device, and not accessing something from internet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

He had been using his beats which were extremely sensitive to weather conditions, like rain, heat, cold etc but he really needed to have the noise canceling aspect as well as being able to hear his music above the din of his equipment. So fast forward 3 months and again I asked for a report, ""unbelievable"" I believe he said. Not a single complaint nor a single issue, through rainy (many) days and now humidity, much airborne dust and pollen, previous cold and now 80 plus days with full humidity, not a sausage, nothing negative at all. In fact he said ""they blow the beats away for quality and consistency""  for a fraction of the price. Blue tooth works perfectly even though his phone is sealed in a waterproof sleeve beneath his clothing, no disruption at all. Though they have never been submerged in water they have gone through the gamut of bad weather and never failed where as the rain was the downfall of his beats.

I have heard and own some of the best recorded music ever produced and I am privileged to own premier playback equipment. I'm always looking for technological advances and improvements in playback equipment such as headphones. Based on the incredible reviews these Cowin E7's received on Amazon I thought it would be advantageous for me, especially in this low price range to see what all the hype was about, so I ordered them.
After unboxing and putting these low priced headphones through a series of audio tests that I run on all my equipment  testing high, midrange, and bass output; testing ambience, fidelity, spatial and pitch parameters, etc, I quickly came to the conclusion that the good reviews of Cowin's E7's were either fake or contrived. These cans are BASS of mostly BASS with a muddy almost monophonic output. There was absolutely no midrange audio and only slight treble. My Sony MDR-7506 Dynamic Professional Studio, corded only headphones (on Amazon at $115.99) are what I test an rate all headphones against. To my ears and experience they are as near to perfect and balanced as anything could be. These low priced Cowin E7's are typical of headphones in this price range and have no measurable fidelity; and the noise cancelling is also very poor, but then when it comes to audio equipment and my years of experience I can state ""you always get what you pay for"" and I didn't pay much so I did not expect much and I did not get much. Mr. Cowin, you've got to know that this is a true evaluation of the E7's and I don't quite understand why so many, if even real, evaluations praise these cans online as they are not as good as portrayed on Amazon.

Let's get the ""Noise Cancellation"" out of the way...not quite sure what it is supposed to do as it doesnt' sound any different than any other pair of over-the-ear headphones that I've ever owned (from the 90's til today).

The PDF documentation from their website is a terrible, cruel joke as it must've been scanned and saved to PDF (lowest quality possible) because it's really that bad. Anybody who knows anything about online document distribution knows that you save your materials in a vector format so scalability isnt' an issue when you have to zoom in to see what the instructions have to say.

Controlling your phone's volume? forget it. You can tap the button to pause, forward and rewind.....and that' it, folks. That's all you get.

They were easy to get working with my Iphone 6SE, and connect quick when I turn them on.  They sound good to me, and are easy to operate.
I am a little bit nervous about the frame holding the ear pieces, because it's made out of plastic.  Because of that I've been babying them and putting them back in the box when I'm done with them.  Not sure how they'd do if they took a fall.

I promptly contacted customer support and was able to get a new pair for free in my hands within about a week (I did not have to return the old ones so I gave them to my Dad). There are several good things to know about these headphones. First, they look very high quality and the weight (from the batteries) makes them feel pretty high quality as well, even though they are just plastic. The sound quality is good, nothing an audiophile would faun over, but nice and clear with plenty of bass for almost everyone. The battery life is also very good, I have never had to worry about them dying on my. I used them all day while flying, with the noise cancellation on, and they did not even give a low battery warning. Speaking of the noise cancellation, this is the average part of the headphones. On their own, the earcups dampen a lot of noise which is nice if you need to conserve battery life. If, however, you are in an environment which has a constant loud sound level (in a plane, car, coffee shop) it will lower the sound level significantly, though not remove it without music or something to go over it. It does not block out sudden noises well, like voices or car horns. When it comes to cons (the reason for the 4 star rating), there are two that are noticeable. First, in wired mode, they often have feedback issues and still turn on bluetooth even though they are already plugged into another device. Second, the active noise cancellation takes away a lot of the bass in music (movies are fine). This is not really an issue if it is loud anyway, but in a quiet environment is quite noticeable.

Overall: good for the price. It is not hard to find headphones like this for 6 or 7 times as much, but these bring a lot to the table for a reasonable price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Daily at work, I use the Bluetooth feature with noise cancellation to listen to music. Sound quality is good except for ultra-high treble and super low bass. This is not a recording studio headphone.

Hover","excellent headphones - long battery life - good noise canceling","October 4, 2019","I have had these for about 5 months now. Great value so far for the price I paid.
I purchased them for a plane trip across the country and wanted some noise canceling headphones, These cut the engine noise from the plane down very well and allowed me to enjoy my music and movies on the plane.
The battery life is excellent! I really hate having to charge headphones every day, these went over a week without having to change them with moderate use.
My one complaint is the low battery signal, it starts at 10%, because of the long battery life it means I still have a little while before it will go dead. but the signal is every minute and interrupts what I'm listening to so much it makes it annoying. I wish there was a way to configure it to beep every percentage drop starting at 10% instead of every minute or at least make it more subtle. *I also wish the head band would fold for more compact storage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Updated review.","July 31, 2019","Updated review : I’ve updated my review from a 3 star to a 5 star for two reasons. 1) This company is obviously very dedicated in making sure their customers are satisfied with their products and I very much appreciate that in a company. 2) I received another pair of headphones, the more expensive, but also upgraded version, and I have zero complaints. These headphones are comfortable, the hands free calling is great, and the battery life is phenomenal. I couldn’t be more satisfied with the replacement!

Original review for Cowin E7- For the price, they work pretty good. The best thing about these is how comfortable they are on my ears. I have to wear them for hours at a time so that is a huge bonus.  My biggest complaint is how poorly they work with the hands free calling. 9/10 times I have to transfer the call to speaker phone because the person on the other line can’t hear me through the headset. The volume up and down buttons are actually backwards so up turns the volume down and down turns the volume up. ( they’re actually backwards on the headset so the - button is on the top and the + button is on the bottom.  Not something that makes a huge difference to me though, just thought it was interesting. ) The sound quality is good. The battery lasts for a while, but not as long as advertised. Mine lasted about 15 hours or so before needing a recharge. They don’t really fit in the carrying bag they come in either. It has a drawstring, but it’s sort of pointless when you can’t close it cause the headphones are sticking out.  The noise cancelling part is noticeable when you use it, but it’s not quite the quality of noise cancelling headphones my husband has. (To be fair he spent much more $$ on his than I did) Overall, I still use them almost daily because they worked well for the purpose that I bought them for. (Listening to recorded things for work). So far, they are holding up really well and I use them very frequently.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Wow. I've never written a product review so quickly after testing out my purchase! I'm sitting here listening to Tron's The Son of Flynn and I'm really impressed with the sound. But backing up just a bit. When I put these on right out of the box, before even turning them on, the world went silent all around me. No, not the active noise cancellation, just an amazing fit over my ears and great sound proof construction just shut out all noise. Pairing with my Lumia 950 was a breeze. The headphones came with enough juice in the battery that I could try them out before charging them, and that makes me happy. The controls are easy, they fit very comfortably, and the sound is fantastic.

[Update 2 months after purchase]
Well, that was short lived. How disappointing. Today while enjoying the great noise cancelling and rich sound I started hearing a not-so rich crackly sound in my right ear. It came and went and then came again and never left. Now I only get relief by playing in standard mode. Using noise cancelling mode is impossible. It sounds like wiring that is sparking and frizzing right next to my ear on the right side. Unfortunately the return window expired one month ago! Yeah, they are still comfortable, and still play in standard mode, but no longer noise cancelling--rather they are noise creating headphones. I'll update if I've been able to get any help from customer support.

[update after getting customer support]
So after dropping my review to 1 star (see above), customer support reached out to me and offered to help. After a few simple email exchanges and confirmation that I had bought these headphones, they offered to send me a new pair. I'm very pleased with their customer support. When searching for Cowin online all I found was websites for the company in China and no easy way to report a problem. Well, I didn't need to fret for too long about it, because they contacted me.

The second pair of E7's arrived yesterday and they work as expected (so far! :p ). I was surprised that they felt different and were slightly smaller than the first set--I needed to extend them much more to fit than the first pair. I didn't think there were different sizes for these, so it could be a change in manufacturing. The noise cancelling on the second pair comes with louder white noise for some reason, but they do work and are comfortable. And for the price they are just what I want.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The feel great on the ears and their lightweight (perhaps some of the lightest). Really enjoy them. My glasses sometimes get squeeze down on my ear a little but a quick adjustment and their good to go. 95% of the time I have no issues in that regard. There is a slight(est) delay when watching Netflix but it becomes unnoticeable. I've been playing popular FPS games with them no problem. Again, a casual gamer so I'm not super picky. I haven't gotten the mic to work though but I don't talk all that much anyway. That's on me though because I haven't tried. The pads are so air tight (noise-cancel) that bass is really strong and it actually hurts my ears when cranked up which is mostly a good thing. They work great with my android device and my PC. Swapping between the two is pretty easy as well. They hold a charge like crazy. I game with them all night and forget to charge them and then use them all day without ever draining the battery. They are amazing in that regard.

I'll be honest - I'd never heard of Corwin before. I bought these headphones based on the reviews/popularity/price. Headphones sounded ok and I had issues with the mic, so I made that initial review. The company then went out of their way to contact me (keep in mind, this was a 3star review, not a 1 or even 2) and they made the situation right. They sent me a replacement pair to make up for the under-performing first pair. And then a few weeks later, they sent a 3rd pair of ""new and improved E-7"" headphones with some updates that they made after hearing feedback from consumers, which is a pretty amazing thing to do. Corwin has gone from a company I honestly didn't know to a company that I now know stands behind their products and reputation and I would now easily recommend them to people. Good customer service goes a long way to me and the way Corwin fixed this issue was Grade-A all the way!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: (3 Stars) I'm very torn on these headphones. The sound is not that bad. But the microphone is terrible. I got these to have video-calls for work and all of my coworkers complain about how bad the audio is. They say it sounds like I'm on a bad phone connection - it's very low and muffled. It might be this pair in particular, or it might be with where the microphone ""hole"" is located on the headset itself. They are relatively comfortable (I wear glasses) and the battery life has been pretty decent as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wanted to add that I do not recommend these headphones to anyone who plans on walking or working out while using them.  The headphones do not stay securely over the ear so any movement causes them to shift around wildly, creating this awful electronic scratching noise.

Original review:
My husband and I live in a fairly small apartment (700ish sq ft) and he's a big online PC gamer.  We use the dining room as an office since we don't really have an extra bedroom for it, so when he is gaming, it is hard to avoid the sounds of him making callouts (which are often more like screamouts) to his team.  It was driving my crazy!  I can't cook in peace because I can hear him from the kitchen.  I can't watch TV in peace because his yelling drowns it out.  There's only so far away I can get in the apartment...I was losing my mind, until I bought these!
With the noise cancelling feature turned on, I almost can't hear my husband at all, even at his loudest.  Since they're wireless, I can move seamlessly from the living room to the kitchen.  I was washing dishes once and realized I could barely even hear the water running!
Now, while wearing these, I can keep up on trashy TV shows while he's playing and not miss anything, even in the tense quiet moments.

They're comfortable enough for long listening periods, and I now consider the sound quality to be above average. 8.5/10 stars.

I also forgot to mention the noise canceling feature in my initial review - 8.5/10 stars. Very good at masking ambient noise while preserving the integrity of the audio you're listening to. I'd say ambient noise is about 85‰ eliminated, which should put these headphones at least in the $150 range. On a full charge, no static, dropouts, or interference in the strong Bluetooth connection. After a few hours, the wireless connection destabilizes a bit, but I don't know any headphones that don't do the same thing. Plus, the shakey signal could just as easily be my computer's fault. That makes the ability  to charge these headphones and listen at the same time a very useful feature.

Pairing and setup was a breeze, though I haven't figured out how to change anything but volume using on ear controls with Win 10 VLC, but that's another extremely minor complaint,and lots of devices don't interface well with Win 10 and VLC, especially audio components for Windows. Biggest flaw of an otherwise great OS. But I digress...

The item arrived well-packaged in a nice, padded box. The included leather carrying case is high quality and very slick. Another nice, appreciated touch was the included aux cable. That enables a must have feature out of the box - the ability to keep listening to your phones even when they have no charge.

Overall, I'm now quite pleased with my purchase. You can't do any better at this price point. I've paid a little less for a lot of different wireless earbuds and headphones, and I never saw any of those cheaper products hold a candle to the E7's. I've also dropped three times the amount of money the E7's cost me, and yeah, some might've had slightly better drivers and other microscopic differences only audiophiles like myself pickup. In terms of functionality though, none of the more expensive cans had one single feature that the E7's dont, and many were missing an item or two.

If you have a ton of money and a killer home studio, go ahead and invest in a stupid expensive, high end, special occasion set... AND THEN BUY THESE TOO, Mr. Moneybanks. The E7's will be your everyday pair - a loyal and reliable companion that you'll only put down when you're sitting in your wood panel listening room, enjoying an unopened, mint condition, rare Miles Davis album on vinyl passed through gold cables. Anywhere else, the E7's are it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The sound reduction by the headphones WITHOUT the noise cancelling on is pretty decent they fit over my entire ear, but with the noise cancelling on it muffles sharp sounds and almost erases (to my ear) background noises like fans or a running fridge.

This was to take place of my Sennheiser 380 Pro which sound amazing but are not noise cancelling at all.  In the three weeks of having the Headphones I have been on 7 flights and 2 High Speed Ferry Boat trips to test them out on.  Here are a few key review points:

The Good:
BT Pairing: Very easy with instructions provided
Comfort/wearability - No problem wearing on flights up to 6 hours long.
Noise Cancelling - Can't beat it for the price.  Stood up to crying children and youth sports teams cheering unnecessarily on flights
Charging & Battery Life - Charges fully in a few hours.  Battery life is amazing; used constantly with Active NC for over 10hrs without dying or disconnecting.
3.5 MM cable - Able to use with Aircraft On-board entertainment where bluetooth connectivity isn't available.

The Bad:
...Sound Quality - The richness of sound varies drastically with the change from Passive NC to Active NC which I was anticipating, hower the the real issue is that the sound begins to crackle once you get to the upper mid volumes to high.
Use of 3.5MM cable - Although a very good option as mentioned in ""the Good"" portion,  It is unfortunate that that power has to be on in order to use the headphones which unnecessarily drains the battery.

Original Review - 2/5 Stars

I purchased this headset because a pair of affordable noise-cancellation would be helpful in an open office plan. The noise cancelling is okay, but when I turn it on I notice a bit of a dip in sound quality.

Recently, I tried using the microphone feature to take some calls and it was horrible. Nobody could hear me at all and the feedback  was that the sound quality was poor and cutting out. I ended up switching to speaker and all parties reported that was much better.

It's back to Avantree for me. They were 20 dollars cheaper and performed better.

Cons:
- Bag that comes with the headphones is a bit too small (Rather use it for other things)
- The button to change the volume can be annoying because you have to hold it down to change volume, if you click it skips to the next/previous song
- When the headphones are on, the Bluetooth connection functionality is always on and any device can search for this, this could present vulnerabilities when connecting.

They have big shoes to fill - my last pair of JVCs survived 8 years. After roughly 15 hrs of use on airplanes in BT/NC mode, I can say they canceled out probably 60%+ of the engine noise. If you wear them to cancel out a fan/air handler or a hotel's window A/C, they block at least 90%. I was astonished ... I could barely hear the 24"" fan in a tile hallway and actually slept in them on Monday to block out the buzzing, droning wall A/C.

So - why 4 stars and not 5? I have a beach ball for a head. That's not Cowin's fault, but it means they need to allow just a little more expansion in their headband to make it comfortable for longer wear (6+ hrs).

Sound quality is good. Noise canceling exceeds expectations. Comfort is great for moderate periods of time. Price point is amazing. BT connectivity is as expected and pairs quickly. Battery life is wonderful - but it's only been a week, so it should be. Fit and finish are just as advertised - they look sharp, feel nice and are well padded. I do wish they came with a better case (the pouch is insufficient for travel) and that the detents in the cup rotation mechanism were stiffer (they feel a bit sloppy to me) but overall I'm a very satisfied customer. All of the important things are covered well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I use them almost everyday to listen to music and once a week to cut and trim my lawn...though I'm sure my neighbors don't care my sing-along lyrics!  Initially, they felt a bit bulky and large, as I'm use to earbuds, big difference.  However, once you enjoy the noise cancelling capability and the easy to setup Bluetooth music, you will not notice the size/weight.  Look over the instructions first, as it is a bit challenging to find and identify each switch/control.  You must plug it into your computer USB port to charge it up; have not checked out any of my chargers to see if any of them are compatible, i.e., not to overcharge it.  As far as how long the charge last, I've used it for three-four hours before I recharged it, as there is not power gauge to show you the charge level.

The first pair I returned due to a battery and distortion defect; the second pair suffered the same problem, but was replaced by Cowin at no charge to me, after an excellent contact exchange with Customer Service. I wanted to be sure that I had a few months of successful use of this product before reviewing it. I received the most recent headphone replacement in early August, 2018. During August, I logged 35.2 hours of use without difficulty before needing to recharge. Between 8/27 and 9/22/18, I logged 36.9 hours of battery life. From 9/24 to 10/17/18, I used the headphones 34.7 hours before recharging. From 10/17 to 11/12/18, I used the headphones for 34.5 hours before charging. From 11/12 to 12/3/18, I used the headphones for 33.6 hours before charging. And finally, between 12/3 to 12/30/18, I logged 30.7 hours of use before recharging. Although I am also tracking January, 2019, I do not plan to report that result. Overall, the fit of the headphone is good, in that it covers the ears and provides adjustment for varying head size. The noise-cancellation is very good in my experience, compared to another brand that I tried before this one. I only wonder at this point whether the battery will grow progressively weaker, as it has shown a shorter capacity to hold power since 9/24, at 34.7 hours, and 12/30/2018, at 30.7 hours. The original estimate for usage was 30 hours per charge, so I have benefitted from longer storage capacity in the first months from 8/4 to 12/3/2018. I remain impressed with the overall quality of the workmanship and the duration of the warranty, which is 18 months. This product is highly recommended based upon my experience; I have only used the Bluetooth feature a few times but it seems to work very well on my Windows 10-based computer. Thank you for taking the time to read this post, and I hope that you will give these headphones a try!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These were a little more expensive that the ones I needed to replace, but they fit very comfortably. I'm 6', so not abnormally large, but the last pair of headphones I got did not encompass my ears. They rested a little on the lobes, which made them uncomfortable after 30 or more minutes. These headphones have larger cups, with very soft padding. I have worn them for hours at a time and not had any discomfort.

The sound quality is also pretty good. I don't normally use, or look for, a lot of bass in my audio so I didn't rate that aspect. But volume, range, and clarity are fairly good.

One of the nice aspects of these headphones is also one of the downsides. I'm referring to the noise cancelling aspect. When you have it set to noise cancelling (there's an option not to as well) the sound is nice and clear. I've used it on planes a few times and it does a decent job of reducing the engine noise. As with most other noise cancelling headphones, it doesn't do much to cancel out higher pitched noises. However, when you don't have it set to noise cancelling mode, there is a LOT of static. I've tried this in a quiet room and I definitely notice this issue. I haven't had this issue with any other set of headphones, and I kind of suspect that the manufacturer added the static to make the noise cancelling mode sound clearer by comparison. You know, a little bit of white noise added to regular mode, then turned off in noise cancelling mode, and it sounds like all of a sudden the ""noise cancellation"" is working. I can't prove it, and wouldn't bother to take the time if I could. I simply keep it turned to noise cancelling mode. I think it reduces battery life though.

Which brings me to the last big aspect; battery life. It's very good, actually. I rarely use them for more than an hour or two at a time, though on trips I've used them for multiple hours (remember to take them off every now and then to let your head and ears rest, as with any other headphones). Even keeping it on noise cancelling mode 100% of the time I've never had these let me down. I think I may have gotten a low battery notice once in the months I've owned it, and I rarely charge them. So it holds a charge for a good while (at least 2 weeks without issue) and can run for hours and hours between charges. I haven't tried to see just how many hours, but certainly it can run longer than I'd need it to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

My kid picked out these darn junk noise canceling headset and I have to pay how much?  I wasn't willing to buy a super expensive set for him to tear up, so I gave in and bought these.  He started using them and I never heard anything from him complaining our TV was too loud, until one day it WAS too loud.  I asked him about them and he said they really work.  I tried them.

Corwin headphones seemed to fall in the range I was comfortable with. The sound is good, but the noise canceling was not quite as though as I had hoped. They did dampen about 3/4 of the engine noise going over, but I had upgraded my seat. Coming home, I don’t think they covered more than about 1/2, just enough to keep it to a dull roar. I also did not expect them to be so glossy and shiny. They are difficult to hold onto when trying to adjust to the right size, and slide around on your head, especially if you have your hair pulled back.

I work in an office and listen to Podcasts and for the most part, they cancel out my annoying office mates who are talking loud on the phone or are listening to the radio.

However, these are fantastic for me. I work in an open office environment and sometimes the level of noise spikes from ambient to distracting to intolerable (you know how there's always that one person in the office louder than everybody else? I sit next to five of them). The very first day, my colleague and I looked at each other and nodded, it's time for noise cancelling headphones - so I did some research, read some reviews, and bought two Cowin E-7's for us.

Having never tried active noise cancelling before, I have to say I'm impressed (my coworker didn't like it, as the noise cancelling made her feel queasy, but that's not Cowin-specific, just the technology in general doesn't agree with her). For me, it puts a strong damper on the background noise. Now if people are talk-yelling loudly, of course I can still hear them, which is great because if someone yells FIRE! I'd like to know about it. But I'm streaming my Boston sports radio and my Pearl Jam and clacking away while my noisy keyboard to get some revenge to those who don't have noise-cancelling headphones like these.

Two quick notes which I hope are helpful. 1.) When using it for Skype (the mic works great by the way) or GoToMeeting, Wiindows 10 might identify it as a communications device rather than the proper stereo headphones. I almost returned these because the sound was so scratchy, especially on music. Thankfully I read another reviewer's comment who identified the issue and how to solve it - it's a Windows thing - you just have to right-click your speaker icon, go to Playback Devices, and make sure the Stereo listing of the E-7 is the default device and the default communications device. Then you'll get the full benefit and the excellent sound quality these headphones provide.

The second is, if  you're like my coworker and don't want noise-cancelling - and buy noise-cancelling headphones for some reason, even though there is a standard pair $10 cheaper right next to it - it's an optional feature you can switch on or off as needed. Sometimes I'll turn it off if it's not noisy in the office, and it still sounds great. Like other headphones with this technology, they can be a bit bulky, but actually they are light and quite comfortable for long use.

So overall, I am very happy with this purchase and don't have any negatives to say about it. Do they compare to the more expensive brands? I can't really answer that, but I also can't imagine those brands being so much better that they justify the cost. These work, and they sound great. That's all I need!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

So originally I had a ton of problems with this headset trying to get it to work on PC. Nothing would work, I had to use external drivers from some shady site to even get bluetooth for this headset to be recognized, and then nothing would register under playback options that this device was even a headset. I returned the headset, got my refund and went on my merry way. Cowin then contacted me, told me that they weren't happy that I didn't like their headset and left them a scathing review and as a token of goodwill they would send me a new set of headphones that they had recently updated their software to make a much better experience for PC users. I thought that they were full of it and there's no possible way they could work, that they were simply trying to buy my review off and get me to change it. But lo and behold, a week later I received a new pair of headphones and when using through bluetooth on both my phone and PC they worked perfectly. No issues.

The adjustable bands are metal not plastic, so they are reasonably durable. It's a little inconvenient that they have to be powered on to hear any sound.

I'm spoiled with having previously used middle-of-the-road Bose headphones. These headphones had pretty much no noise cancelling. These aren't cheaper Bose headphones, Bose is on another level from these. You can only notice the noise cancelling if you listen really closely, even then you may also hear an audible buzzing.

These are good headphones for the price, but I don't recommend buying them for the noise cancelling. Just buy better headphones that don't have noise cancelling at the same price. As a software developer, noise cancelling headphones are pretty important to me. I thought I could save some money getting cheaper noise-cancelling headphones with decreased sound quality, but still noise cancelling. That is not the case with these. I recommend just saving up for quality noise cancelling headphones if that's the reason you are buying them.

**EDIT November 17, 2019 - Customer Service attempts to bribe me to delete my Amazon review**

After posting this review saying that the headphones are good, but probably not worth it for the noise-cancelling, I received an email from the customer relations department to offer me a $40 Amazon gift card or ""an upgrade to another model at no cost"" in ""hopes to earn a review deletion or revision from you"". I ask that anyone looking at these reviews to beware of the fact that some of them may have been poor reviews and then changed after being bribed by the seller. Sure, this product may not be my best purchase, but offering a better model at no cost is not resolving an issue with the product so much as paying me to change my review. I did not take the offer, my review is still 3 stars (I'm really not that critical) and the email is below. I redacted phone number and name, to avoid giving Amazon a reason to take down this review.

Hello Chris,

My name is Lexi. I am contacting you in regards to your noise-canceling headphone purchase. I see you are not satisfied with the item and had left a review.

My god. These make my Bose earbuds sound like absolute rubbish. The range from low to high tones is 😙👌and bass is awesome. I can feel it in my nether regions - ehm... I mean, uh... chest. Yeah. heh.  Bluetooth pairing was a snap with my phone and laptop (though for some reason even though they paired with the laptop immediately and the buttons could control the music app, sound still actually came from the laptop, *not* the headphones - for now I'm chalking that up to user error and not malfunctioning headphones). Noise cancelling so far has been fantabulous. I had music playing on the home stereo, cranked it up to max volume, put these on & could hear my tunes from my phone exceptionally well with the headphones at slightly above half volume - and *nothing* from the stereo. Finally, these are *very* comfortable. Soft like a baby's tushie. I can take my glasses off and put them on, no problems. I don't feel crushed by the headband, and they're comfy over my glasses without crushing my frames into my skull.

Con: so far I've tried a couple of calls on them and callers reported my voice sounding muffled/muddy. Only seemed to improve when I was close to my phone, which, presumably, shouldn't matter. It did make me wonder, however, if that meant the mic in the headphones wasn't working and they were actually only hearing me speak through my phone's mic?

Overall, I would definitely recommend them to any audiophile that wants good music sound quality without having to go deaf while wearing headphones. The craftsmanship is top notch, they feel very durable. Love that they can store flat and have a storage bag for keeping them clean and protected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The E7 is a very comfortable headphone to wear for an extended period, say, 1-2 hours.  Sound reproduction is excellent for a headphone in this price range.  Bass is strong and treble is a bit softer, but at my age high-pitch sounds are not my strong suit.  Construction is solid and everything moves and swivels smoothly.  Noise cancellation in the E7 works very well, much better than I expected, but I can still hear slightly muted sounds from outside. though at a very low sound level that's easily ignored.  Bluetooth link-up with my Kindle Fire HD is fast and I can now listen to YouTube videos without disturbing others.  The ability to listen with them without the annoying audio cables is a real plus.

This weekend was the first time I had a chance to use them.  They were easy to pair with my phone and I wore them for hours while working in my yard.  I figured this would be a great test to see if they stayed on my head as I was moving around.  I never had to adjust them, so they stayed put.  They are so comfortable that at one point I forgot I had them on.  After hours of use, the battery is still almost fully charged.

The noise cancelling work much better than the brand i had before.  I live close to the airport and the planes get pretty loud as they head in for a landing.  The normal engine roar was a minor background noise.

And as a bonus, they have great customer service who reached out after my purchase to ensure everything is going great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I got the black and silver and they look fantastic. It's a shiny finish and it looks so good that I wish I had sprung for the red ones, but still very pleased with the way they look.

They're nicely packaged and secured in the box, comes with manual, headphone jack cable, micro-usb charger cord, a VIP card to register for extended warranty at no cost, and a card to donate $1 to UNICEF if you email them a selfie with your product, which I did.

Pairing is very easy, connected to my Android phone right away. Listened to some lighter rock music at first, liked them, sounded good. Switched to rap and WOW. The bass sounds fantastic and the noice canceling is good. You can hear the outside world a little, which I like, but your music is front and center.

I originally got these for mowing the lawn but I can already tell that I'll be using them all the time because they sound so good. Would definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I tried to fix it with no avail.  Don't buy the head set.  Horrible, Horrible, Horrible … Also the charge really didn't keep as long as is was told.  Don't buy people, Don't buy.

Update.  I got a call from customer service and they offered me a replacement set, an upgraded set.  So far these are working and it has been doing what's expected.  I'm giving these a try and see how long these last, so in the meantime I have changed the score to a 3.

I looked at Bose QC35 (very comfortable, excellent noise cancelling, but way too expensive), JBL Everest Elite 700 (not as expensive, ok noise cancelling, very comfortable but bulky looking), and then these little gems.  I honestly thought this brand was something you'd find only in closeouts or less well known retail establishments and never really gave them a second thought.  I always considered it an off brand, to be honest.  BUT.....I decided to take a chance on them, thinking for this price point, I can't lose, right?

I got these and put them on after charging and wow.  I'm impressed!  Sound is pretty nice, noise cancelling is awesome.  In fact, I think it's comparable to the higher priced headphones I was considering before.  I really don't need a set of headphones that will cancel out every utterance of daily life, just the majority of ambient noise will make me happy.  But honestly, I find that they fit so well around my ears that I really don't need to use the noise cancelling feature that much.  Just the fit makes it noise cancelling.  The bluetooth connection is quick and there is an included audio cable for when you might run out of battery.  These reportedly get 30 hours of battery life on playback, but I have yet to test that out.  If this is the case, then these headphones are far superior (IMHO) to the higher priced headphones that have less battery life.  Plus, if the rechargeable battery dies on these, then I'm not going to be as concerned with buying another set as I would be if I had purchased the higher priced headphones.

As for looks?  They look great, ear cups are soft, headband is padded, and they aren't tight on my head or my ears.  Sure, maybe the metal colored plastic is a little cheap, but I'm not expecting high dollar features for this price point.  And yes, maybe the button on the right to skip ahead and back is a little clicky, but I can deal with it.  Oh, and yes...that clicky skip forward/back button is NOT the volume up/down you might think when you first put them on (I thought it was).  Just so you know.  I cannot find a way to reprogram it.  That is a weird feature.  On wireless headphones, I would think you'd put the volume buttons on the headphones instead of a button to skip songs.  I am concerned, however, that the leatherette headband and earcups will be susceptible to tearing over time due to use, but I'm sure I can find a cover or a replacement and fix that problem straightaway.

Overall, I'm happy I bought these.  I really bought them for travel.  I have a pair of Beats Pro DJ headphones with the aluminum ear cups and they weren't cheap, so to take them on the road with me makes me nervous that they'll get messed up from going in and out of my bag all the time (in fact, that has already happened GRRRR).  Granted, I don't want these to get messed up either, but if it happens then I didn't pay that much for them, and the sting will not be so bad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Snyder","These Are Amazing Headphones","June 26, 2019","I purchased these Cowin E7 ANC Bluetooth headphones in mid June and have been using them regularly since then.  I own a fairly large number of headphones, both over ear and in ear.  I'm kind of a sound geek and I enjoy many genres of music as well as talk radio and podcasts.  Let me summarize why I consider these E7's to be my best headphone purchase in a very long time.

Right out of the box, these phones look amazing!  I ordered them in black; they are sleek and shiny and the overall look is awesome.  I put them on my head, and wow.............I was struck right away by how comfortable they are.  These are without question my most comfortable over ear headphones, and I have around six pairs of over ear phones.  I've fallen asleep with them on in bed, and several hours later when I wake up, they are comfortable and my ears are not sore or hot.  Some headphones have that effect of soreness after several hours; I've not experienced that with the Cowin E7's.

The sound on these headphones is awesome.  I don't consider myself an audiophile.......I do consider myself very picky.  If they don't sound good, I don't use them.  I listen to tons of music and the E7's sound great with all genres.  The bass is strong and punchy........I don't consider it to be overdone or obnoxious the way some phones are!

I love the noise cancelling on these E7's!  I would say it takes away ambient noise in the high 80's percentile and that's pretty darn good.  The bass remains solid with ANC employed.  I have not used them in an airplane yet, but I have used them around white noise fans.  I can tell you that the fan noise all but disappears and I can tell from experience that they will be very effective on airplanes.  Considering their comfort, great sound and ANC ability, these will be my go-to travel headphones in the friendly skies.

The Bluetooth range on the E7's is outstanding.  I get 40 plus feet........sometimes almost 50 with these.  Bottom line......I can go from nearly end to end in my home without drop off and I can easily leave my phone on the dining room table and move through the house doing housework without issues.  My home is about 1500 square feet, to give you some idea.

Now let's talk battery life.  I'll just say that on a full charge, I have used the E7's for 7 hours and I was still almost 100 percent.  That may sound too good to be true, and you may wonder if by making that claim, perhaps I work for Cowin.  That is truly my experience thus far, and I work for a Child Abuse Intervention Center........I don't work for Cowin.  I also want to say that pairing the E7's was super easy........they now pair immediately with my iPhone 8.

You may have read great reviews in the past and then after ordering the product, you were somewhat disappointed.  I can tell you that I worried about that as well.  Let me just say that for under 60 dollars, these phones are like gold to me!  I love them and I would suggest that you will love them too.  Take the plunge and go with the E7's.

I try to keep reviews short, so here are a few key points:

- They are VERY comfortable. I'm a big guy with a large head and they sit on my head and ears comfortably.
- Excellent sound quality and noise-canceling ability. I used these in a crowded open office with lots of loud people all around me and it did the job. Note that loud things can still make their way through, but also note that these are not a pair of behemoth $400 headphones
- GREAT battery life. I could go through most of a week of heavy use without needing any charging.
- Lastly, EXCELLENT customer service. My headphones ended up breaking along a hinge after 9 months of usage, and when I contacted their customer service email address I received a reply in less than 24 hours. They told me about their 18-month warranty and quickly replaced the headphones via Amazon Prime. I was very grateful to have it resolved so quickly.

Overall, if you're looking for a great pair of comfortable noise-canceling headphones without spending an ungodly amount of money, this is a great product for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

It does a good job of blocking out the everyday hum drum noises. The sound quality is also superb. Very full detailed sound and the battery life is great. The Bad: The overall volume capacity is very unimpressive to say the least. My $13 Bluetooth headphones get louder than these. My cheap headphones will go as loud as the phone will allow and you can turn it up past what the phone will allow, on the headphones themselves. These WILL not get loud at all or let you turn them up on the set themselves, past what the phone will allow. The Bluetooth also disconnects frequently. For long periods of time and for short intervals, so you often you hear every other syllable of a word. Very annoying. Very disappointing for the price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'll upgrade my rating to 3 stars only because of the customer service response.
While they do get an A for customer service, these new ""optimized"" headphones still do not provide any significant noise cancellation.  For comparison, I sat in my living room with my tv on normal volume.  I put on the headphones, but did not turn them on.  I could still hear the tv about as well as before.  I turned on the noise cancelling function and literally heard zero reduction in the tv volume.  The headphones were NOT paired to the tv.  I then got out those expensive ones my husband is so fond of and repeated the same steps.  His reduced the tv volume by about 25-30%.  I repeated the same experiment with both sets of headphones -- this time to listen to music on an Apple device.  Same results -- the expensive headphones cancelled out a lot of the background (tv) noise while these did not.  For the price, these are not bad headphones -- they just provide nowhere near the noise cancellation I've come to expect.  Disclaimer -- the husband who is so selfish with his expensive headphones tells me I hear noises only dogs can hear.  That might be the whole issue.

################

While the sound quality of these headphones is adequate, the noise cancelling is almost nonexistent.  I bought these because my husband was tired of sharing his expensive ones and I was not looking to spend another $300+.  I guess I got what I paid for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've owned bluetooth headphones before this is one of the best for the price hands down. The call quality is alright so I've been told. Going on the subway, you can't hear anyone blasting it on the loudest setting. Transit takes me about an hour a day and I listen to maybe 10 hours aside from round-trip transit so I charge it maybe once a week if that, and I'm a good to go.

They're super comfortable. The metal smudges easily, but a shirt will clean it, it isn't even noticeable. The pairing of bluetooth is next to immediate and it isn't complicated process to link up and turn on. If/when they break I'll probably order these again. Honestly I don't see them breaking any time soon for a couple of years due to how well they're built.

Definitely recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They are the only pair I have ever owned so not sure if maybe my expectations are too high but the noise cancelling isn’t the greatest. You can still hear everything going on around you. My ears hurt after wearing them for a bit and have to take them off for a few minutes. The Bluetooth works well and when I’m listening to music as low as it goes (I wish it went lower bc it’s quietist isn’t that quiet) I can’t hear anything else around me so the noise cancelling works great then. For what you pay though I’d say these are an excellent buy. I’ve never had the expensive kind though so not sure if they cancel noise any better when not listening to music and I don’t know if my ears are just sensitive and any pair would hurt after a while. The battery definitely lasts a long time as I hardly every charge them and I use them every day.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Paired to several different devices easily and all on the first try. No issues at all.

I bought these to replace a pair Bose NC headphones that were stolen. I was gun shy tonspend a lot of money on a new pair for fear they would get stolen. I have owned other headphones like beats, JBL and Sennheiser. The sound from these headphones is excellent. Bass and midrange are great in listening to music, movies and audio books.

Construction of the headphones appears to excellent. Obviously time will tell on this. The pair of Beats headphones I had looked great also. The end life of those was not so good.

The right ear got staticky and then went out completely within the same day.  Thank goodness I had the unopened replacement Cowin set that Laurence (see 9/10/18 update) had sent me.  I really do love these. They are a little tighter on the ears than other headphones I've owned, but for sound and noise cancellation, there are none better.  I only hope they last longer than the last ones I bought (and that Laurence replaced), but again, their customer service is over and above any I've dealt with for any product, not just headphones.

UPDATE 9/10/18:  Out of the blue I was contacted via email by Laurence from Cowin. Unprompted, he was letting me know that he'd read my review (see below) and that the headphones were still under warranty.  He offered to send a new pair (I didn't even have to send the broken ones back), or they would refund my money if I'd already gotten a new pair. I opted for a new pair, and the day after Labor Day (five calendar days after his initial contact), I got my brand new pair in the mail. Didn't even have to give my address, credit card, etc. They sent it based on my initial purchase.  Never heard of a company that stood behind its product like that, actually seeking out the customer to make good on a warranty.  AMAZING customer service and a product I can now heartily recommend.

--
ORIGINAL POST: I bought these 10 months ago. The noise cancellation was the best, but they've always hurt my ears a little from the pressure they put on them because of the fact that they sit on a good portion of your actual ear rather than over it. Today I was working, and out of nowhere I just felt a pop.  The right earphone came apart (unglued?) for no obvious reason.  The headphones go from my desk to my head and nowhere else; no rough treatment; never been dropped. I don't even adjust them. They've been at the same (minimum) adjustment since the day I got them pretty much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are absolutely phenomenal headphones. I bought them about a year and a half ago and I use them all the time. I had a pair of on ear headphones from a no-name brand a few years ago and, while they served their purpose, they were not impressively loud and became a little aggravating on the ears after a while. These sit very comfortably on my head while I do chores around the house or yard work etc. I run a mobile auto detailing business in my spare time and use them for that as well.  I don’t have a particularly large head and they fit nicely, but I imagine they would be better for someone with a big noggin. If I find myself looking down for too long they will start to slip off my head. I wouldn’t even attempt to do any kind of cardio with these. Weightlifting, sure but running - no. They are too lose and when using the noise canceling feature, any excess movement makes it crackle.

The noise canceling is pretty decent. It’s not Bose quality but it’s plenty powerful to muffle a mower, vacuum or grinder. It almost entirely mutes plane noise. Like I mentioned, it doesn’t take much jostling to make it crackle, but if it becomes too annoying I just turn the NC off.

Sound quality is also pretty good. Depending on the app/song I’m listening to, it can get EXTREMELY loud.  So much so that I have to turn it down - which is saying something because I listen to my music on full blast most of the time. Sound quality is marginally better with the NC on, but marginally louder with NC off.

Build construction is solid enough. Kind of feels like a few steps up from just cheap plastic. Don’t get me wrong - it IS cheap plastic but it presents itself well. Pads are very soft and so far the body has been durable. I’ve dropped these on the ground a few times and, while they are covered in scratches, they are still performing fabulously.

Finally, and very importantly, the battery life on these is UNPRECEDENTED. I mean I will use these for hours a day for like 2 weeks in a row before even thinking about charging them. I think they advertise 16 hours, but no joke I have probably used these for 40+ hours between charges and they still weren’t dead. Unbelievable. There is also a widget for the iPhone but I’ve found it to be entirely inaccurate.

Bluetooth connection is lightning fast and has superb distance. In an open field I’ve used them further than 80’ from my phone.

Gripes: I have only a few.
My biggest gripe is the piss poor Siri support. There is not a designated Siri button which sucks. And it wouldn’t be so bad, but there is about a 4 second delay between Siri activation and the prompt to begin speaking. I hope they addressed this with the E8’s.

There is an LED on the command switch that never turns off and is quite bright. Also not a huge deal, but it bothers my wife if I try to wear them in bed.

Lastly, the hinges of the earpieces have become a little squeaky and loose after a year. Overall, these are minute gripes that I actually had to think about to put in here.

Overall these are a fantastic set of headphones and have earned their 5-stars from me. I bought another product from Cowin and had to get in touch with their customer support and was very pleased. I will buy from Cowin in the future

Edit: 10-11-18

I am still using these headphones and continue to be blown away by their deceptively good quality. I mean these suckers refuse to die. I’ve added a few photos this time to show how much abuse they’ve taken over the past few years. The leather is gnarled over the headpiece. There are scratches everywhere. I’ve even dropped this pair off my roof by accident. They didn’t care. They laughed and kept playing the ‘Man of Steel’ film score. Not even joking - that really happened. The battery life remains miraculous. Still getting 30+ hours of play time on full volume. That is an absolute feat considering the common life of Li-Ion batteries. The buttons still work. The Noise Cancelling still works. And despite their twisted appearance, they remain unconventionally comfortable. In my previous post I mentioned that they had started to squeak around the hinges. Yeah that just stopped. I am seriously astounded by these headphones and wonder if I’ll ever even need to upgrade to the E8’s. In any case - Cowin has still got my vote when it comes down to a reasonably priced headphone of extraordinary longevity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I had always used wired pairs because my old iPod didn't have blue tooth and I thought the wireless ones would be unreliable.  Well, my iPod finally died after a decade and I had to buy a new one so I gave the wireless headphones a try.  I was very much impressed.  The sound quality was decent, the noise cancelling worked really well and I wasn't ripping a cord out with the weed eater every five minutes.  It was also nice that I could jump off of my mower to pick up sticks leaving my iPod on the mower.  I easily went up to 15 feet away with no problem. It wasn't until I started walking back to my garage and lost connection that I realize I left my iPod on my mower 30 feet away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

 He absolutely loved them!  Then the bluetooth glitched the day after the return period.  I was so irritated.  I put a review on here while irritated and then contacted the manufacturer...not really expecting them to take care of me.  WELL, they replied promptly and sent out a new pair asap.  Then they called to make sure that I was doing ok.  The lady that called was very kind and apologetic I am SUPER happy that I bought from this company!  They've stood behind their product and they seem to really care about their customers.  I'm very impressed!  I wish there were a 6 star rating that I could give them for exceeding my expectations completely.

I bought them to use at work to better concentrate when people around me are ""collaborating"".  I have also used them in my home office and they are fantastic.  Here is a breakdown of the pros and cons:

Noise Cancelling: Both a Pro and a Con:
- Con: These are not really ""noise cancelling"".  It would be more accurate to call them ""Ambient background noise reducing"".  When I turn on the noise cancelling feature, you can definitely tell a difference, but you can still hear people talking and some other background noises.  Just know that these will NOT cut out ALL noise (but neither did the big name brand $300 ""B"" headphones I tried).  Have realistic expectations when you buy these.
- Pro: They DO reduce much of the ambient background noise that you often do not even realize is there. When you turn on the Noise Cancelling function, you can tell a difference, especially when I am at work and it almost completely eliminates the sound of the building air circulation system and my desk fan, etc.  It is a subtle change, but it has a surprisingly big impact on my ability to focus on my work.  If you are expecting TOTAL silence, you will be disappointed.  If you are expecting these to help you focus by reducing some background noise, these are great.  I have also found that it is a good thing that I can still hear co-workers talking because I can hear if somebody is trying to get my attention.  These seem to block out just enough to make a difference and help me focus, but I can still hear enough so that I am not totally removed from the environment.  A good balance for what I need.

Pros:
- Great price!  These were about 1/6th the cost of the big name brand ""B"" headphones my coworker has.  I have tried them side by side, and while I am no pro, I could not tell a difference.
- Comfort; padded in all the right areas, they are comfortable on the top of my head as well as around my ears. Easy to wear for an hour or two, although they do get a little warm on my ears (just built up body heat since your ears are fully enclosed, there does not seem to be any head coming from the speakers at all).
- Functional; the sound quality is decent; just as good as the $300 name brand ""B"" headphones I compared them to, although I generally like the sound quality of earbuds better, these seem to provide the same sound quality as any other full enclosure headphones I have tried.
- Easy to connect via Bluetooth to my phone.
- I use both the noise cancelling and Bluetooth settings about equally.  Sometimes I need to cut out ambient noise and focus, other times I want to listen to music, and both work well
- Battery life; so far I have only charged it once (proactively).  The battery life seems to be fantastic!

Cons:
- they do not feel heavy duty.  I hesitate to list this as a con because you want headphones to be light so they remain comfortable while wearing them, and these are light.  My concern is whether or not they will break.  NOTHING has broken so far, but I would not throw these in a backpack without a case.  If you plan on transporting these from one location to another, I would recommend purchasing a hard-shell carrying case just to be safe
- Strange button design: for some reason they put the 'Volume Up' and 'Next Track' buttons BELOW the 'Volume Down' and 'Previous Track' button.  So to turn the volume up, you have to press the 'down' button, and to turn it down, you have to press the 'up' button.  It is a minor thing and you get used to it fast enough, it is just an odd design that I think they could easily improve.

At the end of the day these have been great headphones at a fraction (1/6th) the price of their major name brand competitor.  Definitely recommended if you want something functional and are on a budget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

PROS: sound quality is great. I believe it is very comparable with the more expensive and popular brands out there. When I connect the device to my phone, the music sounds superb.

CONS: It's quite sensitive to the bluetooth connection. My desktop is underneath my desk and noises get very static when I'm sitting on my chair, however, works very well when I was sitting underneath my desk for testing purposes.

UPDATE 7/28/2017
COWIN reached out after sending another set of headphones after I returned it, asking if I was still facing the issues, and to provide them with another review. Honestly, my issue was not completely resolved again. I'm still having connection issues (mentioned above) when my desktop is underneath the table. However, I am very touched by the customer service. As mentioned, the product quality is superb when the bluetooth is working fine  without any obstacles in between your connection.

No complaints from. I was fixing to spend $300 more than what these coast on Bose. Thought I'd try these first, can always return them but I'm see no reason to and saved the $300 by keeping them.

The Cowing E7 is by far the best.

Pros
- Great audio quality. Basses were punchy and did not distort even on low frequencies, in the 15 - 20 Hz range. Trebles were crispy and clear all the way to 15KHz.
- Good noise active noise cancellation. It was able to mute most of the noise from my fridge
- Beautiful packaging
- Easy bluetooth pairing
- Great value for the money

Cons
- Uncomfortable. The ear pads are small and round. They go over your ear, not around it, and apply too much pressure. After 30 minutes of use, it started hurting. This was the only reason why I did not keep these. If you have small ears, you may like them though.
- Design feels a bit cheap. There is too much shining plastic and fingerprints stick everywhere
- Does not fold. It takes a lot of space.
- Does not work once battery dies
- Physical controls are limited. You have volume control and a single toggle for BT and ANC. There are no track controls, like pause or next. There are also not any controls to invoke the assistant from your phone.
- No case. It comes with a bag though.

Alternatives
The Cowin E7 costs at least $10 more than all the other headphones I tested. This difference is worth it though. The TaoTronics, Tribit and MPOW all sound terrible in comparison and none of them holds a candle to the noise cancellation of the Cowin.

These are the best headphones I tested under $150 dollars. If you are willing to spend more than that though, consider the Sennheiser HD 4.50 (around $150) or the superb Bose Quiet Comfort 35. Both have better sound, noise cancellation and are more comfortable.

Verdict
Buy the Cowin E7 if it is comfortable for you and your budget is under $150.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Unfortunately, the product doesn't measure up in this category. If you're looking for decent bluetooth headphones with moderate *passive* noise cancelling, this might be a good purchase for you.  Not for me.
3M Peltor X5A earmuffs (www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CPCHBCQ) that I bought 5 years ago - that use only PASSIVE noise cancellation technology - work much better to block noise than this Cowin product.
To make sure that some active noise cancelling technology actually does measure up, I went to Best Buy and tried several headphones with this feature... All the ones I tried (yes, costing at least 3 times more) outperformed the Cowin in this category. Admittedly, some of the products at Best Buy - e.g., Skull Candy - just barely outperformed the Cowin headphones. In fact, only one set of active noise candelling headphones I tried out at Best Buy clearly outperformed the passive noise cancelling of my 3M ear muffs - the Sony model WH1000XM3. But not quite sure yet if it's worth $350 - for my modest need of removing noisy neighbor sounds from my awareness during an otherwise meditative morning time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After being disapppointed with the perfomance of the first set contacted the seller and was impressed with great customer service. I just received my new pair and while still not what i was hoping for they sound much much better. Thank you people at Cowin for making the purchase worthwhile.

I was impressed with the look and feel of them. I only needed the basic function of them so the noise cancellation and Bluetooth were just bonuses.

Duncan","Not for the large headed, still","April 23, 2017","EDIT:  I'm leaving my original review at the bottom.  But, I absolutely HAVE to mention the customer service experience I have had with COWIN.  Even after I had already returned the first set i bought, they were willing to ship me a completely new pair FOR FREE to allow me a chance to give them another, more lengthy test.  Which I absolutely have done, so i can say plenty more about them.  Fit wise, they are still not ideal for someone with my head size and ear size.  Which are definitely far above average.  But, after spending lots of time fiddling around with them, i found a way that they were at least comfortable enough to wear while doing chores around the house and other like tasks.  The max time I could stand was about 45 minutes, so definitely not good for marathon gaming sessions or Netflix binge watching.  The other major complaint I have about these is the noise cancellation.  Its mostly passive from the foam pad seal, which is actually VERY EXCELLENT.  However, when I turned on the active NC, it... didn't really do anything but muffle the music quite a bit while only SLIGHTLY reducing ambient noise more than just the seal does.  This is definitely an area of ""you get what you pay for"" so if more isolation is what you're looking for, you're gonna have to spend way more than $80.  Sound reproduction is absolutely top notch though.  Very clear and crisp while I was listening to house and electronica EDM.  The low end and bass is NOT punchy at all though.  Not something I care much about, but if that's something you want, you're also gonna have to look elsewhere.  Despite all its shortcomings though, I HIGHLY recommend this set of headphones.

I'm going to preface this review with some simple facts.  I have a VERY BIG head (size 8 hats are usually uncomfortably snug, depending on the manufacture) and also abnormally sensitive ears.  I found the clamping force to be too snug for my taste and the ear cups pinched and flattened my ears to the point of discomfort in about 5 minutes.  However, if you are someone that doesn't suffer from such annoyances, you'll most likely love these.  The sound quality was fantastic for my use case (music and PC games).  I cant say anything about either the battery life or the noise cancellation as I dint own them long enough to test either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I work in an open office setting, and need the ability to make clear, static free calls. The volume isn't loud enough, the sound quality is barely better than in-ear buds, and despite the noise canceling feature, callers on the other end seem to hear everything. Disappointing.

Update 3 August 2017:
First, Cowin's customer service is outstanding. They contacted me soon after my initial review, expressed their apologies, and sent me a new pair to review. For that alone, they get four stars.

Regarding the new headphones with what appears to be upgraded firmware, the sound quality is better, the volume is louder without being obnoxious, and the noise canceling is very good. The only reason I can't give it five stars is because the microphone quality is not good. The other person on the call said it sounds like I'm in a tunnel with a lot of static.

The E-7 is a great product for listening and noise canceling, but I can't recommend it for phone calls.

It was so spotty and it would ""skip"" every time I took a step. I them tried the aux cord and it was bad as well. I had someone else try them on and they asked me to put the volume up.....

I was pleasantly surprised to find that these headsets are nearly as good as the big boys. Sounds quality is lacking just a tad - but, I'm a bit of an audiophile, so I am extra critical when it comes to sound quality. The high-end sounds decent, while the low end struggles just a tad - but I imagine for most folks, the sound quality will be excellent.

I do a lot of flying, so the noise cancellation is important to me. The headphones perform very well in noise cancellation mode, with minimal degradation of sound while in use (again, you will lose a little low-end when using noise cancellation). I also love the fact that you can use these corded, or cordless. The entertainment system on planes requires a headphone input - so, I can quickly plug it into these headsets and watch their entertainment. But, if I'm just using with my phone, the Bluetooth works wonderfully as well.

The battery life is by far, the best I've ever seen with over the air headphones. They last forever - easily 20 hours of use before needing a charge.

My only complaint is the volume up/down and track forward/back buttons are complicated, and not placed in an ideal spot. The buttons are on the outside, in a triangle setup, with combined volume up/down and track forward/back buttons. I hate the combo buttons. Plus, the up/down buttons are ""reversed"" from what you would expect, logically. Turning the volume up requires you to push the bottom button, etc. But, this is not enough to take away from a 5-star rating. It's just a small annoyance that I quickly adapted to.

All-in-all, if you are not a super-picky audiophile, these headsets should work great for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The SE7 headphones are a great set of headphones. The sound is very clear and has a great depth of tones with bass. The Bluetooth is very quick and easy to use, it pairs very quickly when turned on. I was able to get over 40ft away from my phone and still have good signal. I love the headphone design and carrying case. I just throw these in my luggage when traveling and don't worry about them being damaged.  The noise cancelling really works well. I have a train that comes by frequently and I would turn on the nose cancelling to block the train horn. I never used the 3.5 jack to plug into my phone since my phone does not have a headphone jack connection.

However the microphone when using Bluetooth for a phone call is mediocre at best. It sounds like you're talking on speaker phone from the other side of the room. People kept asking me to repeat my sentences because they could not hear me. The buttons are very small and close together, made it hard for me to manipulate the controls without taking the headphones off. But I'm 6'4"" with XL hands.
If you're traveling or just listening to music these headphones are great. But if you plan on using them to talk on your phone, I cannot recommend them.

They have function buttons on the side which is nice...took me a little getting used to but it's convenient.

I really like the sound quality. I thought the bass was actually pretty good, better than more expensive brands I've tried. The battery life is also very good. Right now I use these solely for listening to music from my phone so I haven't used them for more than 3 hours in one use so far and the battery life was still in the upper 80% range.

After charging the battery, I was quickly able to make a Bluetooth connection to my Android phone.  The sound quality was excellent.  I was able to adjust the phones to the size of my (large) head.  I then wired a connection between the phones to my home stereo, and the sound quality was good for a variety of music.

My only issue so far has been the learning curve viz a viz the controls.  I have found it hard to locate the switch, the cable socket and other controls since I am looking for black on black, and the on-off, Bluetooth switch is tiny.  I am hoping that with use I will become more adept at using the controls.  I have used Bose Quiet Comfort phones in the past, which have fallen apart after many years, and feel that they had somewhat stronger noise cancellation, but at a much higher price.  I am looking forward to using the Cowins on an airplane, the ultimate test.

Overall I am very happy with the headphones and regard them as great value for money","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

- Do not by them unless you are okay with ANOTHER thing to recharge in order to be usable (NO passive audio)

I am spoiled by BOSE QuietComfort 25 .. So I'm using that as my 5 baseline benchmark out of 5:

SUMMARY
- Sound quality [4]
- Noise cancelling [1] (the earcups are pretty good just by themselves)
- Cost to value [3]
- Head wearing comfort [4]
- Features / operation [2]

PROS
- Super nice packaging
- Slick design
- Very comforatble
- Good weight, the earcups keep a decent amount of ambient noise out
- Comes with rechargable battery preinstalled
- Pairing is straightforward and easy
- Sound quality is great
- And then suddenly  ...

CONS
- With active noise cancelling activated just completely removes any hope for bass response that you had
- It is as if it is cancelling the ambient sound noise bleed through out of the earcup itself!
- With active noise cancelling active, you can hear a constant HISS that LOUDER than NOT having it on [Old Cassette tape hiss]
- With active noise cancelling on, if you wiggle the side (which you will do because of all the controls) it does a very strange thing and cuts out and jumbles the audio signal for a moment
- To use them you have to have them CONSTANTLY in the ON position, thus zapping your brain with bluetooth radiation [which makes me want to take them off]
- They include a 1/8"" adapter, however you can't use them as standard pass-through headphones [OFF MEANS OFF!]
- To turn UP the volume, the button is on the BOTTOM, and turning DOWN is on the TOP - very counter intuitive control
- The chrome gets ""fingerprinty"" SUPER fast and looks gnarly (maybe I just have gnarly oily hands?)
- The included cable is MAYBE only 2 1/2 feet?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

*EDIT TO ADD UPDATE* The company I bought these from read my review and sent me a new headphone at no extra cost to me. They worked fine until last week, in the middle of my work day when the sound just stopped. It showed that my audio book was still playing, and it displayed correctly when I pushed the button on the right earpiece to pause, but there was no sound...nothing. So this pair worked for an even shorter time than the first pair. Now I have 2 sets of headphones that don't work, and I'm even more bummed. I can honestly say the quality in comparison with the cost is just not worth it...I will never buy this brand again, I've learned my lesson.

I received a reply from the manufacturer and they provided a replacement. As previously stated, this was a great headphone while it worked, so I am hoping for a better experience this time around.

*******

I have had this headset for a few months now, it has great sound and is really comfortable. My problem is that the charging side earpiece detached for no reason from the headpiece. There was no fall or any type of shock to cause this issue, so I can only assume this is due to substandard materials and poor design.

likes: comfort, weight, audio quality, customer service
dislikes: NC circuit works only on a relatively narrow band of sound, first pair died after a week

comments: as noted, the first pair died after about a week of use, they started to make a weird hum/whine noise and then it wouldn't charge.
customer service was very good, getting me a new replacement headset  fairly quickly(and no charge)

i bought these with the intent to reduce the noise exposure in my office which is next to a small data center with a shared, open ceiling. the overall noise is quite loud with four data servers, six linux boxes(rendering and LTO service) and two mac pros(to serve macs in the main office)
occassionally i would get massive headaches due to the noise levels and ear plugs made my head fill up.  not wanting to go all in on an isolating headset, i thought i'd try to see if the noise reduction would help. the difference is interesting to say the least - while i can still hear most of the fans and computers, i don't get headaches anymore and when you switch the NC circuit off, you notice the 'whooshing' noise is what's missing.  i have not tried these on an airplane flight, but i'd bet they would be very good at killing that dull, loud whooshing that is so annoying.  having never tried any of the more expensive brands, i don't anything to compare these to, but i like these.  what surprised me the most is how good music sounds with NC on, good bass(not boomy or thumping) clear mids and highs, not shrill or brittle. very smooth and not fatiguing to listen to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Pros-
When music is playing , they do block out sound fairly effectively
priced fairly
connects to your phone super easily
ease of use and reasonable charge time
sound quality is good for the price

Cons-
They don't seem to be a one size is good for all set of headphone, they fit me fine but they only fit ok on my husband and we try to share headphones (so if you have a larger head, you may not like them)
They aren't a high quality build, they however do not feel super cheap
Sound quality is good for price but it isn't high end sound, so if you want really good sound, you will want to spend more money.

Takeaway- overall for the price and my needs these are excellent. I need them to play music and audio books and to block out sound and do it effectively. I need sub- $100 headphone and these are it. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Initially a 5 star review -1 star for not being able to just plug them into a source and listen- they need to be charged which can be an inconvenience but honestly for the sound quality I'm fine with it. All day comfort no issues great product!

One day of use so far so longevity, I will make a mental note and come back on hopefully in 6 months but honestly my memory is lacking sometimes so it may be a year.

Initial impressions...... Wait these are less then $60. Wow what a bargain box shows up inside that Amazon cardboard box perfect condition. Headphone packaging was made for higher end( these when a new product I guess) product then this price point so bonus to us the consumer. Opening the box you see the carrying bag almost seems of the same material as the headphone pads more on them later. Pull the bag aside anf the Headphones lay facing at you. Mine are black and beautiful, presentation is top notch right up there with the Sennheiser phones these are replacing at almost 4x this price point. Nice work Cowin Group. These headphones are so adjustable they fit my big ole 7 7/8 like a velvet glove. Comfortable? Oh my goodness yes wore them for 10.5 hrs today at work hardly noticed them  bad part is I almost forgot I had them on and plugged in haha that woukd've be an ooppsssie. :). Came with a full charge nice to see how long they will last. Anyways I listen to good ole blues, jazz (Miles Davis sounds so so fantastic), metal, r& b, top 40 and so far not one sound out of tune or artificial sounding. I love them.
I love the thank you note, I love the VIP card.

I love these Cowins not sure how they created this super lush material that sits over my ears but I""m glad they did. Comfort 5 stars.

I've tried a few different models. I'm looking specifically for diverse headphones that don't sacrifice clarity for bass. I thought I could expect a good result from these, as Cowin seems to have a good rapport. First, I'll give the good.
PROS: comfortable, wide ear cups. They sat quite naturally over my ears. The low bass notes punch through pretty well. They look stylish.
CONS: Cheap, crappy build. The headband is kid toy-level plastic painted silver. Feels like it won't take much. The interface is annoying; slide the on button slightly too much and you might turn to NTC or OFF. For the sound quality, the treble is horrible, the mids are under average. The only good sound quality is the low bass tones, which are stronger than any other similarly-priced models I tried. But the overall sound quality is muddy, muffled and pushed behind the blanketing low tones. These are only good for bass-drenched music, and cannot be used across genres. Finally, if you're at all serious about the ANC, you need to upgrade to a higher price level. I can tell you after trying headphones in this price range, the ANC technology just isn't there. It cuts out low tones, but you can hear the noise just the same. It also ruins your sound quality.
CONLUSION: With the cheap build and underperforming sound, I almost immediately knew I would be returning these. If you just want a pair of headphones with good low bass, these may work for you. If you're a discerning listener, look elsewhere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

If you prefer something succinct scroll to the bottom.

I originally purchased these headphones in 2017. I was less than impressed, a one star review. I went out on bought a refurbished JBL Elite 700 headphones $100 ( new was over $300 at the time). No way I'm spending over $100 for headphones, and even that's pushing it. They sounded great, and the noise canceling superb.

Now I'm trying the Cowins again. I pair it with my phone LG Android. The sound wasn't good. The JBLs sound great but keep in mind I had to adjust the built in EQ in addition to purchasing a sound booster/EQ app. Without the sound booster the volume with the JBLs was too low.

I spent a lot of time fine tuning the JBL sound profiles for various genres of music and really, there's too many.  I love tweaking the heck out of things like OSes, certain electronics, but headphones? No! I should be able to turn them on/or plug-in and enjoy.

Of course I'm disappointed, but this time I also paired it with my iPad Pro 10.5. I started watching The Matrix and was blown away. The JBLs have a bit better bass, but with the JBLs I kept waiting for parts of the movie in which my thought was, hey this is going to sound really awesome.

The Cowins audio is exceptional throughout the entire movie. After spending 30 minutes messing with JBLs EQ, I just couldn't get them to sound like the Cowins. I've watched the Matrix many times over so I wasn't planning on watching the entire movie. Couldn't help it with the Cowins. JBLs? stopped it in short order.

A comparison for games was necessary as well. Compared to the Cowins, JBL failed miserably .  No amount of tweaking the built in EQ helped.

*I still need to review the NFC, but I wanted to redo my review as it was negative the first time. I will also take this time to apologize to the manufacture for not trying the headphones on other devices and rating the product so low.*

A personal note. The JBLs are heavy and a bit tight, you can't listen to them for a long time without your head hurting. I also had surgery on my neck. I can't wear the JBLs because of the weight.  The Cowins are light enough to watch an entire movie.

I just noticed there's an updated Cowin headphones. One pair for me and one for my wife. Saving up enough to see<=== lol how they sound. Goes hand in hand with the succinct version of my review.

For you shot review junkies.
Cowins sound as awesome as an OLED display looks compared to my LCD monitors.

First though, I should mention that I have never really owned over the head headsets with pads this large that can completely cover the ears.  However I have tested various similar in the stores.  Long and short - there is nothing better than the high end Bose for noise cancelling, but at $350 simply not an option for me.  The noise cancelling on these for me don't really do it, but I never understood the need once you have the volume up!  Compared the Beats and other headsets, these are actually pretty decent.  In addition, they come with audio connectors, so if the battery dies on you and you have an audio output on your system (phone, tablet, laptop) you can plug them right in and keep on going.

Service:  I had an issue while using these at the gym where I changed equalizer settings and had crackling sounds and strange control behaviors.  I mentioned to the vendor and they did not hesitate to send me another pair to replace the first purchase.  Absolutely floored me.  So while the first pair ""might"" have a problem with the bluetooth, the second did not demonstrate the same issue.  Excellent service and support!

Good base, good volume, long battery life, and the audio connector is a great backup. If you want the best then you will pay for the best.

I finally landed on these after some research.

1. Appearance

They are sleek black and chrome plastic. Very durable and aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. Subdued classic look. The pads and headband have a leather-type material covering them for comfort and added appearance. They arrived exactly as pictured.

2. Sound Quality

Extremely crisp, high quality on-ear headphones. Part of the reason for my 4 star rating instead of 5, is that they do not get as loud as other headphones I've had. The built in volume control on the side doesn't allow these headphones to get very loud.

3. Noise cancelling function

The biggest part of my 4 star review instead of 5 is the noise cancelling function. It does work when activated, but a strange problem occurs with my headset that may or may not be present in all of them. If I have the NC function on, and the headphones shake while on my head at all, such as turning my head quickly enough, there is a stutter in sound and quality where it drops for a moment. This problem is easily reproduceable. While not moving or rattling the headphones in any way, the NC function works great.

4. Battery Life

I use an iPhone 6s Plus, and when using these headphones there is a battery bar displayed at the top of my screen. So far, after being used for a few hours, I haven't even began to scratch the surface of the battery life on these headphones, even with NC activated. Awesome battery life indeed.

5. Comfort

Everyone has a preference for headphone type, and I prefer on-ear cups. These are great. The material in the pads is soft and form fitting, and you can tighten the headband enough that they won't fall off your head when moving around with them on. They can also lay behind your head over your neck, and are just as comfortable.

Overall the problem with the NC was a little disappointing for me personally, but over all well worth the price for the battery life, style, and comfort. I would still reccomend these headphones to just about anyone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After about six hours of use the blue tooth had stopped working.the noise canceling continued to work  i first thought that they needed to be charges so i did that (i was no where near the thirty hours that they claimed ) but thinking i left the switch on just maybe!. after charging no help with the blue tooth . i then left the on to completely discharge and recharge still no help. and to add insult to injury i ended up carrying them all over the place like empty weight.
also the pair i got looks like it might have been used. Not new like they claimed maybe repackaged
the pros
they are comfortable
they sounded good while they were working
cons
blue tooth failed after six hours
noise canceling isn't the best
looked like maybe they were refurbished or used and sold as new?","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have them paired with all types of things and get great sound, or I can choose to block noise, and they don't make you feel pressure in your ears like most cheap ones do, but I don't like noise cancel when listening to music, it takes away from it, so I let them be open with music and use the noise cancelling feature when trying to find peace or using as a comm device. At first the controls seemed strange, but after just a few uses, all the buttons seem to be well placed. No way I'm spending over 300 dollars for a set that can just barely edge out these!. I love em so far I've had no problems whatsoever and they sound great and are comfortable to wear. They don't have that high dollar ear muff material, so if left one for a length of time, they can make you ears hot, but other that that I feel as though I have a set of Bose or Sony's on for MUCH less money.

+ Cheap (like the budge).
+ Sound quality is okay. Not bad. Fine. Alright. Acceptable.
+ Durable, in that Fischer-Price way.
+ Battery life is pretty good.

- Noise cancelling is more like noise reduction. It will cut out lower frequencies a bit, but anyone who has used nicer noise cancelling headphones will turn on the feature and be disappointed.
- They're not that comfortable. The ear cut padding is quite thick, but doesn't really apply even pressure around the ears. The padding is also round instead of oval? The top band is well padded, but the big, thick plastic headband still puts a lot of pressure on the top of my head. I think that a lot of the discomfort I have from wearing these for more than a few hours at a time is down to...
- The E7 is heavy. There's no forgetting you have these strapped to your head. And the cans themselves are massive. I suspect that Cowin chunked the biggest batteries they could into these so they advertise long battery life without regard to weight.
- The mic is inadequate. No one can hear me when I'm speaking at normal phone talking volume, so if I get a call while wearing them I have to un-pair them from my phone. Bleh.
- The E7 alerts you when the battery is getting low by chirping. Fine. But it does this about 30~ minutes before you run out of juice and then KEEPS DOING IT for the rest of the time. So subtract 30 minutes from the battery time  because listening to the low battery warning is obnoxious as hell.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I just received these Cowin E7 headphones today so these are very early impressions!

The headphones paired up with my PC immediately and without any difficulty - much easier than my old headphones. It took me a little while to locate and function test the controls -  but once I found everything 8t was easy to operate the headphones.

But all of that was not my main concern - I was worried about the sound quality (taking into account my aging ears)!
The sound was nice and bright, very clear, and the bass was really strong. The best part is that these are very reasonably priced.  I'm budget-minded and have no one to impress with cool name-brand toys. Cowin was not a familiar name to me but I am impressed so far.

I'd recommend these headphones to anyone who appreciates good sound at a friendly price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I use them when I walk to work and when using my riding lawnmower.
I was a little worried about some of the reviews stating the headphones cut in/out while using them. But I figured for 60 bucks I would give it a try. (earbuds and other headphones were either to heavy or outside ear would hurt)
I was pleasantly pleased with the sound quality and lightweight.
While walking to work I started to notice the sound cutting in and out, I was concerned, I should have listened to those reviews was going through my head. Noticed that it only did it while walking to work or if I moved my head to fast.
One day walking back from work, I removed my hoodie cause I was getting hot (midwest weather, morning cold afternoon hot) and the cutting in and out stopped. Did some more test and found that in NC the headphones were sensitive to my hood scraping against it or any slight touch to the headphones. Tested it out on my riding lawnmower (NC selected) and as long as nothing touched the headphones they worked as described. Now when walking to work and I need to wear my hoodie, I select BT and have no cut in/out issues.
Sound quality for 60 bucks is worth it. Haven't tried the handsfree phone part.
Weight.
I used them on my lawn tractor for 5 hrs straight (rolling the lawn) Never had any fatigue or headache. Zero, none!
Light as a feather.
All in all, there above average for that price.

Battery life is great also (I charge mine about once a week with 3-6 hours of usage per day). And they are extremely comfortable

The bad: Once the battery gets to a certain point, the right speaker will ""pop"" so to speak when on noise cancellation and you make sudden movements. I assume it reacts a bit too slow at that point, or the cups suction slightly to my head causing a pressure difference.. It definitely has something to do with noise cancelling feature though. That is fine, flip to regular bluetooth, and that issue goes away.

That alone is amazing.

The sound is very good and the ability to use a 3.5mm cable (to listen to in-flight movies) is VERY convenient.

NFC makes pairing super easy (ever try to pair a bluetooth device on an airplane?  Good luck finding your device when 100+ phones all show up on the bluetooth screen.  NFC means you just hold the phone to the headset and it connects.

The noise cancellation is noticeable, and does quiet down outside noise, and for a $60 headset its a good performer... but it does not silence the white noise completely on an airplane.  Music is not really affected by the noise cancellation and I was happy with the fidelity of the speaker.

The bad is a little to small for storage, the top cannot close.  Minor issue.

I'll admit I haven't taken care of them the best but they have taken a beating. The sound quality is pretty good given the price range. I've used the noise cancellation a lot and have enjoyed how good they are at noise canceling. I wore them for at least 6 hours every day and I would say they're a 4/5 in terms of comfort. They recommend removing them every hour or so. But if left on long, it can become uncomfortable. The earpads and the overhead arch-thing are made of synthetic material and will wear down/detach from the headphones over time. Things like sweat will accelerate this breakdown. The design of them is simple, minimal and sleek. Some other headphones are ginormous or have too much going on in terms of design.

I would highly recommend these headphones!

with active noise cancelling ,  most noise under 40db is clearly muted or completely canceled,
noise or voices between 40db and 60db are garbled but muted
anything with a higher pitch or db , you should really pay attention to as it poses unsafe conditions

These folks go way out of their way to ensure their customers come first. That's important to me. And you don't have to tack on the cost of a good warranty on top of that.

Now the big question how good are the headphones. For the price you are paying these are truly great ones.
The sound is on the bass side and the noise cancelling feature cancels out everything except voices. which for me is great....they fit nicely over the ears gives a very gentle feel to the ears...and my ears are big....

S","Great price, great sound, great range, comfortable.","June 2, 2017","Bought these as a replacement for the failed (after 2.5 yrs) Sennheiser RS120. There are some good upgrades with these that other wireless headphones miss. The active noise cancelling works terrific! These are over ear, more comfortable than the on ear. They're a little small cupped, round instead of oval, but positioning over normal size ears makes it doable and can wear for hours at a time. Best thing about these headphones are the RANGE, 60+ feet, other headphones cover ~33 feet, some homes are larger and you may hear lots of dropouts. These may drop outside the range, but pick it back up quickly upon a head turn. Of course, you have to have a transmitter capable of broadcasting bluetooth range of more than the headphone range and I chose the Avantree LONG RANGE trx/rx for that purpose. Good match, great sound, better than previous wireless I owned and certainly better than stock HDTV speakers. Volume controls are a little slow, but they get there. These also boast of 20+ hours of use, don't doubt it, but haven't tested them beyond 4 hours.

I realize that in not paying a premium, I should not expect premium performance. And so overall, I am happy with this purchase. But these headphones are not going to allow you to flip a switch and block out the noise in a coffee shop or other non-constant white noise.  The noise cancelling in these headphones is good enough to get rid of some white noise ""hum"" in the ambient background noise, but that's about it. Their other noise cancelling properties come largely from an earmuff effect - they physically block noise because they are large, over-ear headphones.  What this means for me is I can put these on in a noisy coffee shop and knock the noise down enough where I don't have to blast music into my brain to be able to work - which is a more pleasant way to work. But without music on, I am still in a coffee shop, listening to a dozen conversations, and having difficulty focusing.  So if you want headphones that take the edge off just enough to listen to music at a reasonable volume in a crowded place, these will do just fine. If you are expecting to flip a switch and mute the world, these will not do the job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound is good for casual use.

Cons: So, there are others that have mentioned that the minimum volume is too loud. This is true if you are connected via blue tooth, the minimum volume is rather loud. If you connect with the cable it's much better.
I usually use it with the cable in an open office. Occasionally someone accidentally connects with with my headphones, annoying but rare.
My major complaint is that it beeps when the battery is low and it beeps loud. It will continue beeping while charging when it's below a certain mark so it's best to take them off and charge once it beeps.
These are cheap and the swivel joints will break damaging the circuitry. I've had two of these and they last about a year before the joints break (used 5x a week).

The reality: These are cheap and work fairly well. They will not block out people talking in your office but it will block out the sounds of the air system and reduce ambient noise. The low battery issue is easily prepared for but very annoying.

I bought a second pair for gaming and it's wonderful in terms of canceling out the sound of my family around me but it isn't completely sound proof. I do also wear glasses so at first it is awkward to have on and after about 3 hours I'll take them off just for comfort but I believe that is just a simple issue. The padding on the ears are soft and don't become an issue until that 3 hour mark for me unlike other headphones I've tried where the cushioning is firm and crushes your ear.

I have ridiculously noisy neighbors. These headphones work so well I don't always have to play something and when I do, I don't have to have it blaring in my ears. Beyond comfortable, love the adjustable ear piece. I especially love I can move about while using due to wireless. Bluetooth set up took seconds and I've only had to do it once.  Long charge, too. Got in a purple which I'd just fun. I hate that I have to live with headphones on; but these are wonderful and the clarity of sound and noise cancelling make me forget in times when I have to use them.

The sound:

the sound is pretty decent with some good bass but don't expect to go deaf cranking up the volume with these on. Don't get me wrong they sound good but I can turn the volume up and sometimes I would have just liked a little more.

Apparently the person next to me can hear the music just fine when I'm listening with these on. If I have the volume more than halfway my wife can almost tell me what song I'm listening to from halfway across the room.

These say noise cancelling but when the headphones are switched into noise cancelling mode (off - on - NC) all the difference I notice is that the bass is turned off. Literally when I switch from on to NC the bass goes away.

Material Quality:

I'm torn on this one. Everything feels real nice until you press the three buttons. Do you remember the buttons on the portable disc-mans a long time ago? The buttons kind of move when you wiggle them, they click like cheap plastic on plastic? Same here. All three buttons are one triangle and the three points have different functions. When you have the headphones on and you press any of them you feel the kind of cheap feeling click in your ear. But this is just nit picking. The headphones, on the whole, feel great, have a good weight, and the muffs are comfortable on the ears. It is extremely well padded around the top of the head.

Battery Life:

Holy fk! I've never seen a pair of bt headphones perform this well this long. I'm used to the old days, before I became enlightened, where I listened to music through my earbuds until the evening when they'd beep and flash red and I had to plug then in. These things, though? Days. Days and days. I've never had them die on me once. I go about four days or more if I hadn't used them more than three hours per day for a while. I've never seen this performance length before, I'm quite impressed. Bonus marks for this.

Keeping in mind the sound, the volume strength, the NC feature, material, craftsmanship, and battery life, these amount to great headphones in the price range but I don't think I'm here to grade on a curve. These are good headphones compared to $250 but not great, not exactly comparable. But also they don't compare to the $15 ones you'll find at Dollar General either. Compared from $15 (1 star) - $250 (5 stars) they rank a two 1/2. They outperform $15 one but aren't quite to the levels of $250 headphones.

I've reviewed these headphones as best as I could and in being honest with my full opinion. Please read other reviews and use this review as mainly a guide in what questions you could want to get answered by others.

Thx

UPDATE****

I received a second pair of these from the seller (""if you take down your low review we will send you an updated pair"", they sent the same pair) and after trying them im still of the same opinion.

After almost a year of enjoyment, the COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones developed an annoying beeping noise that I can clearly hear over music and my audible book.  The headphones can be plugged into my cell phone or computer, and the lousy beeping sound is always present.  I initially thought the annoying beeping sound might be a built in reminder to charge the headphones.  Nope.  Headphones are fully charged and the annoying beeping sound continues to occur.  My purchase of the $59.99 COWIN E7 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones was a complete waste of money.  Six months into the purchase, there is zero product support.

I'm not a huge fan of the plastic silver or the big button, but that's subjective. They feel fairly sturdy and reasonably well made. I have large ears, unfortunately, so any around/over the ear headphones are generally uncomfortable for me. I wore these for an hour in my house and they did not give me a headache or pinch my ears as many headphones do.

I am not an audiophile, but the sound seemed a bit muddy to me. I did come from headphones which plug in and I understand that bluetooth degrades sound quality. There are evidently headphones which support higher resolution sound from bluetooth; I am not sure if these do or not because my Android phone doesn't support the standard anyway.

The huge problem with these headphones, and why I returned them, is the noise cancelling feature. When noise cancelling is on, just walking around my apartment would cause them to go in and out. Touching either headphone would cause the sound to go in and out. I thought maybe this was a noise cancelling problem until I researched and found that many noise cancelling headphones do not have this problem. Furthermore, the noise cancelling doesn't seem to do much. Because the headphones are like earmuffs, you can't hear much with or without noise cancelling, and when you turn on the noise cancelling, the music sounds even worse.

Finally, I didn't love the side button. It sort of wobbles, and it is not intuitive to increase/decrease sound or skip tracks. I frequently blasted or silenced my music. Also, when you're touching the button, the music cuts out if you're using noise cancelling. I think it would make more sense to spend a bit more on some alternate headphones if you're looking for noise cancelling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I had a set of BOHM NC headphones for several years. The sound is great and like these, better than the asking price. The BOHMs had a weak design flaw and if handled rough could break. After babying them for years, it finally happened. Although the price point is the same, the Cowin E7 is better. I appreciate that after the first bluetooth connection, they connect to my android everytime after that, no scanning each time looking for the signal. NC feature is satisfactory and does the job well. The bass is a little heavy, but the sound is very clean. You may hear instrumentation never heard before on favorite songs.

The noise cancellation feature is incredible, and sound quality is up there, too.  By far the easiest pairing process I've had, just putting the back of my phone against the earpiece and they were connected in a snap!  Microphone quality is decent as well, or so I have been told.

My only complaint is that the play/pause button doesn't also work as a Google Assistant trigger, but instead redials when it is held down.  In fact, it's a little too easy to redial with just two taps on the play/pause.

Overall, the headphones have a decent build quality and nice padding.  It's hard to tell in some of Amazon's pictures, but the headband is padded as well.  I have a 22 inch head, and they fit snugly over my ears.  The ear-muff padding seems of decent quality as well, but that remains to be seen!  The bag that the headphones came with is useful, but I would recommend getting a hard-shell case instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

DO NOT BUY!!!!","June 27, 2019","As a set of bluetooth headphones, I have no complaint.  The audio quality may  not impress audiophiles, but it is good enough for me, in fact better than any other headphones I've owned.  And the bluetooth connection has never dropped for me—something I can't say for other bluetooth products.  If I had paid $30 for a set of Bluetooth headphones I'd be very happy with my purchase.  But these are advertised as having active noise cancellation, which is a complete crock of $%1+.  There is no detectable noise cancellation.

For example, I'm in my office with a bass-heavy song playing loudly in my ears through these things, and a relatively quiet fan behind me is still audible.  There is ZERO noise cancellation.  And YES, in case you're about to ask, I DO have the switch on the headphones set to the NC position.  I can't discern any difference between the two ""on"" positions, with and without (the supposed) noise cancellation.

When the Bose headphones are in noise canceling mode and before any audio is played, virtually no outside noise is heard. When the Cowins are in the noise canceling mode and no audio is playing, I can hear some outside sound. When I started the audio, I heard no outside noise. For a $60 pair of headphones, they do a great job. They are comfortable—no sore ears after 60 minutes of continuous wear. I would have given  a 4.5 rating if I could have.

Just buy them already.","July 18, 2019","Holy crap are these awesome headphones! I bought them because there were over 11,000 reviews on Amazon and they were rated very highly. Now that I have them I see (or rather hear) why people love them.
I had them delivered to my office. Opened the impressively packed box to see the pleather bag, phones, charging and aux cables. Turned them on and paired to my phone in seconds to see that the battery registered at 100% charged. So of course I put them on.
Immediately I noticed how much external sound they block, and I hadn't even turned on noise cancelling yet! The NC performance is fantastic for the price. The annoying office AC background noise is gone. As is the typing and conversion ""buzz"" from nearby cubicles! I am in awe.

Pros: I'm not sure you can beat the sound quality and noise cancelling for the price. Seriously great. They are also extremely comfortable with loose hinge points so that you don't get too much pressure on your ears.
Cons: I'm not a fan of the dual use button setup. When attempting to adjust volume I inadvertently skipped between song tracks. Minor annoyance I know, but it's there. Also I know they sell the hard case separately, but I wish it came as a bundle even for a slightly higher price point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

So when we moved into our new house and found out a house that touches the corner of ours over the wall loves parties with loud spanish karaoke it was a problem. Not only was it impossible for me to try and cope by focusing on the lyrics (I don't speak a lick of spanish and it's hard to hear anything but noise) but my stupid brain makes me hear phantom noises even after they stop.

I saved up and ordered these headphones and the moment I turned on the noise cancelling was the first time I'd enjoyed silence in years. We bought a house because apartments were expensive and the noise was always a problem, and now I can truly enjoy the peace and quiet of our home thanks to these. I also like that I can still hear high notes to a certain degree with noise cancelling, so it blocks out the awful bass but if I turn the tv up I can still listen to that and it's like I live out in the country. They are also very comfortable (my husband says I have small bear ears so YMMV) and durable. I've only had to charge them a few times and they charge quickly. Overall I couldn't be more happy with this purchase. They hooked right up to my laptop and phone, with minimal tweaking to compensate for windows 10 being silly. I almost wish I had more bluetooth devices because I like using these so much. They even drown out most of the noise from the AC unit when it kicks on. I'm wearing them right now because someone's got a car with a noisy stereo outside.

To clarify, I'm not an expert on sound quality or anything. I bought these to help me get some peace and quiet to help with anxiety. To that end, I'm giving them a 5 because they do exactly what I wanted them to. Look to other reviews for more in depth talk about the actual sound quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Baker","Decent pair of headphones","September 2, 2019","I haven't had enough time to really put these headphones through their paces, but here are my initial impressions:
1. They are comfortable. No pain around my ears or on my head.
2. They look high-quality. The design of the headphones themselves, the carry pouch, and the box are top-notch.
3. They work. Syncing up with my Android phone was a piece of cake.

Now for the three metrics Amazon rates these headphones on:
1. Noise cancellation: They do this pretty well. The noise cancellation actually cancels out some ringing I have in my ears, which is really neat. I can still hear loud noises around me, such as faucets running in the same room, but most quieter noises are drowned out. The noise cancellation combined with music or white noise completes the aural isolation. 4/5.
2. Sound quality: They're pretty good, but nothing to write home about. I listened to ""Tom Sawyer"" by RUSH (my go-to EQ song) and it sounded okay, but a little flat to my ears. I also tried songs by Pink Floyd, Boston, Kansas, Dream Theater, Genesis, Bon Jovi, and Journey. Same story—there's enough definition to hear all the different parts/instruments, but a lack of clarity or crispness. The sound doesn't *pop*. I'm a little disappointed in this regard. 3/5.
3. Bass quality: I could hear bass articulated well on all the songs I played. However, as with the sound quality evaluation above, it lacks some definition and punch. I will also note that the bass significantly diminishes with noise cancellation turned on, but this appears to be endemic to all noise-cancelling 'phones. 3/5.

Overall rating: 3.5/5, rounded up to 4/5.

I'm not wowed, but I'm satisfied. I bought these headphones for an upcoming long plane ride across the Atlantic. Other reviewers say these 'phones are great for such flights, so I'm hopeful they'll suit their purpose well. In terms of bang for your buck, I'd say these are a fair bargain. If you're looking for something with crisp sonic quality, I'd pass on these. My Sennheiser HD 201s ($20) do a better job of making music *pop*.

I am returning a pair of 250.00 Sony XB950N1 Extra Bass Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones because the Cowin’s sound just as good and last longer (30 hours vs 22 hours for the Sony - long enough for any of our trips).

I have been playing it right out of the box with no charge for two hours now and you are suppose to charge it for 7 hours before using it.  I ordered it at 8 this morning and it was sitting on my doorstep at 6 pm today - same day delivery.

If you happen to get unlucky enough to sit next to a crying baby or over the wing engines you will really appreciate the electronic noise cancellation.  It helps me sleep better and it blocks out background noise.  You do not have to play music to block out ambient noise.  You can just put it over your ears as silent earmuffs cancelling out noise. It is bluetooth and NFC so instant pairing with your phone or computer and you can plug it in with a cord also no battery usage at all.

Because they last 30 hours without recharging, I can work on my videos throughout the entire flight and on the long train ride to and from Tibet with no wires.  Light and comfortable with padded ear and headband.  You can forget you are wearing it.

By the way, you can talk on the phone with them also.  They have a bluetooth microphone.

I cannot vouch for longevity or customer service yet but my initial impression is excellent and they are not even at full charge.

They do have an 18 month warranty with registration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I like the build quality, and the way the headphones turn so they can go flat when I wear them around my neck.

Noise cancellation is effective, and really mute the noise around my desk, though the battery with Noise Cancellation doesn't seem to last as long as I would like. After just 3-4 hours with NC on, it starts beeping like the battery is running low, though I haven't pushed it to its limit to see if NC will last all day.

I have two issues with the way the controls are designed, and 2 technical issues that make me worry about how long they will last.

1. Since the noise cancellation and the power are a single switch, it is hard to turn off noise cancellation without turning the unit off entirely. NC is on one end of the switch, off is the other end, and on without NC is in the middle. It's hard for me to move the switch to the middle without going straight through to the other side when wearing them.

2. The volume up button is below and behind the volume down button. This is completely backwards. I have no idea why someone would intentionally use this layout. Volume up should be above (or in front of) the volume down button.

3. Power loss issues. Sometimes the headphones turn off when I move the earpiece. I've noticed this more so with the left earpiece. I lifted the left earpiece off my ear, and the unit immediately turned off. I had to put the power switch to off and then on to use them again. I've also had the same thing when taking the unit off my head and wearing it around my neck for a few minutes. This has happened at least 3 times today. This doesn't happen every time I move them, but it's happened often enough that I'm regretting my purchase.

4. Connection issues. Sometimes when I turn on the headphones, they don't connect. I paired them to my computer a few days ago, but ever since the first day it has refused to connect again. Today I re-paired it to my computer and that got it to connect. A related issue is that going into pairing mode doesn't always seem to work, the blue light doesn't start flashing. Actually, both of these issues could possibly be connected to issue #3, it could be that the unit is turning off immediately and that is why it doesn't connect.

UPDATE 18 Jan 2019:
I contacted Cowin audio's support team by e-mail about the power loss issues. They promptly sent me a code to order a new set of headphones for free. The new headphones do not have any power loss issues. The battery life while using Noise Cancelling is also longer (I've been using it for 6 hours today and haven't heard a low battery indicator).
It still bothers me that the volume buttons are backwards from how they should be, but that seems like such a minor issue I can't justify taking away a star from an otherwise great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

That, coupled with the very comfortable, non-ear-pinching way they sit on my head, would have automatically earned a 5-star rating from me, especially given the decent sound quality and price.

However, the actual mechanical build seems to be of quite poor quality. The left side broke at the swivel (see pics attached) - just came loose and now its basically useless! And that too within a few months of use. That knocks down all the stars unfortunately.

I will need to get another pair, but I won't be going for these, which is quite a shame since I was enjoying them quite a lot.

EDIT.: Got the SE7 as a replacement from the manufacturer. That one has better sound quality and same great battery life. However, the comfort is definitely down a couple of notches - the ear pads are a different more oval shape that I don't enjoy as much and they sit tighter than one would like even with the adjustable head strap. I can't wear them for more than a  couple of hours straight. On the noise cancellation is now much better with the better with this design. I'd have liked to not have to sacrifice the comfort for the noise cancellation, but there it is.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I tried some cheaper different branded ones, and they were swiftly returned and I can say easily that although these were twice the price, the sound quality is 100 times better.  And for the noise cancelling, it’s like magic. I’ve worn them on a plane, and I usually have painful popping in my ears throughout the whole flight (especially when using the Apple earbuds) but I had not only minimal to no popping, but I didn’t have to have my volume on full blast to cover up the roaring engines.
Alternate great use for over-ear headphones, people don’t talk to you if you’re “cans” are on. I get nauseous when people want to chat on planes...

Bronson","Mediocre functionality, but comfortable and decent audio","March 19, 2018","*updated review after customer service provided a replacement for the defective pair that was originally received.  I will still say that I find the controls to be not well thought out.  The up (top) button is designed to either skip back or turn the volume down. This is a counter-intuitive design.  I also dislike the main switch on the bottom that moves from the Off position to the On position (Bluetooth) and often slides right past the middle and all the way to the noise cancelation setting (which is a white noise that I find distracting due to the mic picking up subtle bumps and dimming the audio in order to squelch the noise).  Moving that slider back to the Bluetooth-only (On) setting usually results in turning the unit off due to the same issue of easily overshooting the step of the switch.  It also still appears that the power must be on in order to use the wired connection.  The audio is still pretty clear and the headphones are quite comfortable.  I don't think they'll stay on during heavy activity.  I'm leaning towards keeping these dedicated to use while playing guitar, or some casual listening around the house, but I don't have much greater expectations or plans for these headphones.

Original review (in full):
I expected a lot better quality from a pair of headphones at this price.  The noise canceling is just simple white noise.  The audio quality while noise cancelation is turned on is, effectively, like turning all of your bass off.  The headphones don't work with the wired connection at all unless you turn them on. The volume / track up/down button design is opposite (up is down) and, on this unit, didn't even work! The only good thing I can say is the Bluetooth audio quality did not suffer, compared to wired.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I messaged the seller that in bluetooth mode, I can connect to my iPhone and I hear music. With the music playing there is a reduction in volume when I switch to noise cancelling mode and I can still hear the other noise in the room around me.

With no music playing, When I switch to noise cancelling mode, there is no change. These headphones do not actively cancel noise. I own other NC headphones. I should be able to hear the difference.

The one line response that I got was a question as to what device I was connected to. That should not matter, they should cancel noise with no audio playing, that’s the whole point. No helpful suggestions. No request to test anything to determine if they are defective. No offer to replace them. Just a waste of time.

These appear to be well built, almost to the point of being too heavy. They are full coverage cups over the ears and that is the only thing that muffles any ambient room noise.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I replaced it with a Samsung due to cost.  Bose being $350 and the Samsung about $200 (don't really recall).  The Bose and Samsung were about the same.  They both used a soft noise as a noise cancelling device and it was noticeable.  Especially for someone with hyperacusia.  But they both worked well.  I really liked the small size of the Bose.

Cowin has exceeded all expectation and for a very small price.  There is no background noise at all.  Noise cancelling is  extremely good without that buzzing noise.

The sound quality has also exceeded expectation.  I have been using a Sony headset and thought it was good but this Cowin....WOW!  The quality of the sound is perfection!  I struggle with the Sony finding a volume that works for me.  It is constant up/down.  The Cowin sounds like a very high-end sound system.  I have set the volume and that is it.  I no longer hear high notes or have the sound of music or commercials cause me extreme grief.  It moderates the sound exceedingly well.

I will never own another brand of noise cancelling headphones.  I am sold!

Original Review:
I got these for myself for Christmas after having tried at least 3 others bluetooth headsets. I had hoped these would be better than the others. Meh. The sound quality is great for listening, but there is TERRIBLE background noise when I'm using them as a headset for my mobile phone. I don't hear it, but the people I talk to can hear ""monsters or gremlins"" in the background.

So, I'll keep these for listening, but am continuing my search for a good pair of headphones that I can use with my phone. I work from home and I'm on calls almost all day. A wired set, while a slam-dunk for sound and such, is just not practical.

On the + side: These are very comfortable, the bluetooth connection is easy to make, and they have tremendous battery life. If I could only get the gremlins out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I definitely use them every day. Mostly for music, training videos, and podcasts.

Cons:
1. The ear pads  aren't removable. I realized after I got these that they were on ear. They looked like over ear and fit more like over ear headphones. They seem to be holding up fine after a month of use however.

2. The noise canceling ruins the lows and hurts the mids/highs. It's not super bad but is really noticeable. It works well for podcasts or audio books. Not for music. Oh and it's built into the Bluetooth so you need that on for the ANC to work

3. The Mic works ok wired. Not so great on Bluetooth.

Pro's:

1. The Bluetooth sounds really good. As long as you don't use the noise canceling, these sound as good wired as on Bluetooth. The range is about 15-20 feet in an open area. walls lower this a lot. Perfect for a tiny house.

2. the noise canceling, though it affects the audio significantly, works very well. Not as good as Bose, but the actual function is better than most high end noise canceling headphones.

3. The overall sound is pretty good. I would put these on par with other headphones in the price range like the mx30. Great balance on the spectrum. good bass for bass heavy rock, good mids and highs for indie. The sound is solid in balance and pretty clear.

4. They are comfortable. I wear them a couple hours a day on and off. They do get warm after a while but for me, I never wear them more then 30 minutes without taking them off.

For the price you pay, these headphones are good. The sound quality is good with good amount of bass. They are also quite comfortable and have long battery life. The noise cancellation can drown out sounds that are continuous such as PC fans, AC, or a plane well, but doesn't really help at all with keyboard noise or people talking. I can still hear my PC fans, but it is quite a bit less quiet. You also barely hear it once you actually play something. When I first got these headphones, the right cup made high pitched noise in right cup if listening through aux. Cowin sent me replacement and the new ones are better.
I took off a star because I don't like how the sound quality differs so much between ANC being on or off. It sounds bad and tinny with it off, but sounds great with it on.

Here's the kicker , I ordered a second set of the Cowin E7 certified refurbished the set up is the same you can see and feel some difference in the padding and head band (feels cheaper and slapped together one swivel is tighter than the other ect) but the sound quality loudness bass and clarity are all noticeably better on the less expensive refurbished version doesn't make sense but this stuff happens those were only 35$ delivered with prime.

Quinlan","Great for those who don't need the top of the line brands or features.","October 18, 2018","For the price, these headphones are great. After going through several cheap (<$25) headphones and never being able to hear movies on my kindle during flights, I decided to get a noise canceling pair.  While this pair doesn't completely cut background noise out, it dramatically reduces it on flights. Even when I wasn't watching a movie, I wore them when a baby was having a justified meltdown on the plane from Seattle to London Heathrow.  I could still hear the baby, and at first was thinking they weren't doing anything, until I took them off... holy cow, they went back on fast!  Also notable was how the charge lasted for my entire 9.5 hour flight, and the 2 hour drive to my final destination because I forgot to turn them off.  If like me you don't use headphones enough to buy a super fancy pair, these are a good back up.  My only complaint, which is minor, is the storage bag. You cannot close the bag with the drawstring because the headphones are too big for it... not sure why they couldn't add an extra inch of pleather and make it functional.  My husband has used these on his commute a couple of times and has requested a pair for our flight to england at Christmas, so all things considered, these are a good buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sound Quality:
No sound above about 15.5K it just dies there. does reproduce down to 30 hz in the bass range which is pretty good. Definitely not High End Audio Quality but for the price i was not expecting it either. There is no comparison to my Sennheiser HD820's ($2399.00 pair) but then i dont what the expensive ones to be thrown around in my carry on luggage either.

Noise Reduction:
They did drown out the air conditioner at work. most of it was done just by having them on. But when the Noise Cancellation was activated it took the rest of the noise out. So at least it works I will see in a week how they do on an airplane.

Build Quality:
Seems Okay will have to see how they preform over time.

Ease of use:
I do not like the way they fold or rotate. the ear pieces rotate in the wrong direction as far as i am concerned. If i am in an airport or other location where wearing them can sometime mean they are around my neck in stead of across my head the rotation of the ear pieces is downward not upward. This means that you can not hear them at all. if the ear pieces rotated the other way and pointed up they could be heard.

The cannot be use while plugged in to charge. Not a great situation but can be handled.

The fact that they came with a charging cord and a 3.5mm jack cord make it easy to charge them and also means they can be used to listen to music, movies on planes or music from my phone via bluetooth.

They paired up to my Samsung Note 8 very easily.

Phone Call Use:
I have not tried this yet and doubt I will. If i have them on I don't want to be disturbed.

That being said, I bought these for a long flight to China. In the past when I’ve flown, my ears have hurt from both my normal earbuds and also from having to turn the volume up so I can hear over the normal sounds of the plane. I experienced neither of these things with these headphones and I would say I wore them for probably 8 hours on each leg of my flights. As for the noise cancellation, both my husband and I were shocked at the difference when the noise cancellation is active vs inactive. It’s pretty powerful in my opinion. I thought my ears would hurt from having them covered, but that didn’t happen either. One charge before each of my flights and I didn’t run out of battery in the approximately 8 hours of use each way. Highly recommend! Not to mention, the purple is cute and just a vibrant as in the photos. The only thing I would say is that I recommend getting a case for them.

I wrote my original review the day after I received these from Amazon, immediately after filing for a return. The same day Cowin sent me a new ""upgraded"" pair at no charge with an apology letter and a more direct line of contact for continuing feedback. I was completely floored. An apology letter or an opportunity to help improve their product would have been largely unheard of by themselves - but both combined with a free replacement?! There can be no company more committed to customer service than this - and they deserve patronage for it. So if you are on the fence, at least give any pair of Cowin headphones a shot - they have many to choose from.

***Original Review: 3 Star***
I was very unhappy with this set of headphones, especially for the price point. They aren't comfortable, not only are the ear holes small for an adult - the are extremely tight.

The audio quality was very ""meh"", not bad but the sound was flat, no bass to speak of, and the audio levels were not very powerful. I couldn't tell a difference turn the noise canceling on - I tried it in different environments.

Are these bad? No ... but you can get equal value for $20-30 less getting similar quality from other manufacturers. Or you can spend $20-30 more and step up 1-2 tiers in quality and performance based on your needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have a lot of potential noise (80+ db) at times including dust collection, saws, wood cutting on the lathe where large bowls act like a large speaker when you are cutting them out, etc.  I find that this set of phones eliminates ear fatigue from the noise, cancelling out much of it, but allowing enough sound to penetrate that you can tell a saw is running, etc.  I do have to watch some of the quieter equipment though as it will nearly cancel out all of the sound.  This allows you feedback that equipment is running but eliminates the high decibel level you have without the noise reduction on the phones.  I have a computer in my shop with a blue tooth transmitter that I listen to music with.  This works very well with the phones (near line of sight) and I find I can have the volume turned down quite a bit and hear the music quite well with the equipment running.  The only problem I have experienced is that I could not turn ""up"" my headphones but realized I was standing next to a set of speakers that were playing the music also and the phones were cancelling out the music!

They are super soft and fully cover my ears (which was a big thing due to piercings).  The sound was good and the active noise cancelling was fine.

The window for returns was 1 month and the window for service and fixes was 2 :(  I will be buying another pair that will hopefully last quite  bit longer.

I’ve only had the replacement ones for less than a month - so if these last longer (preferable a couple years!) I will upgrade my rating to a 5. They are still super soft and comfortable. I love that they completely cover my ears - I have piercings that make the on ears headphones painful to wear! They are super easy to setup with Bluetooth.

The Product:

The Cowin E-7 is lightweight and incredibly comfortable to wear.  The leather-covered foam ear pads are silky smooth, and provide a soft yet complete fit over the ear.  These muff-style speakers are stylish, but more than that, the sound quality matches (or is greater than) much more expensive models.  What makes this perfect for cars and planes is the noise cancellation technology which allows you to listen at a much lower decibel level than other brands without this technology.  There is an incredible 30 hours of playtime in Bluetooth mode, but the included connector will allow for use if the battery is dead.

2 Hints:

For best enjoyment, get the carrying case to protect your Cowin E-7 while traveling.  Also, get a plugable USB Bluetooth device for use with computers.  The muffs work great with I-Phones, and needs no extra equipment.  On some computers (and other devices), there is a Bluetooth connection readily available, but on some computers (and similar devices), you will need a plugable USB Bluetooth to be able to enjoy your Cowin Wireless Speakers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But, of course, I lost them on the train one day, and couldn't bring myself to spend another $200+.  I thought I would give these a try instead - that way, when (not if, but when) I lose them again, I won't feel so bad. Oddly enough, I do think this is a ""get what you pay for experience.""  I think these are great headphones -- for the price.  But I also think the Bose are better, and I think it's up to each person to determine how much these things are worth.  Here's my pros/cons:

Sound cancelling -- no question, the E7 does the job.  But no question, the Bose were better.  I mostly wear noise cancelling headphones while I'm planes or trains.  So it's a loud environment.  The Bose cancelled better, but probably not $150 better.

Size -- this is actually where I miss the Bose the most.  They fold, which these do not, and thus fit into a much smaller carrying case.  The carrying case for the E7 is fine, but the whole thing is bulky.

Comfort -- the Bose fit my ears slightly better than these do, but the E7 is perfectly fine.  The main comfort point for me is that the E7 are much larger around the ear, and have more sharp edges.  When I'm trying to sleep on the plane, I found the Bose allowed me to rest my head against the headrest more easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I bought the headphones in the winter and first tried them out for outdoor walks in the cold.  I found the fidelity to be good and the bluetooth was fine.  Moreover, I found that the headphones kept me warmer.  That, of course, is a plus for the winter.

As far as the noise cancellation is concerned, I tried the headphones indoors while vacuuming.  I did hear the vacuum cleaner but it cut way down on the noise levels.  The headphones were comfortable enough related to the weight and feel.

The next test for noise cancellation was lawn mowing. The regular noise level of a lawnmower is louder than an operator should bear.  Then I tried using the Cowin E7 Headphones.  Just putting them on reduced the noise to some extent.  When I switched on the noise cancellation switch, I found the lawnmower noise became just a background sound.  That was very welcome.  I did find, however, that the headphones kept too much heat in my head.  For that reason as well, in the warmer weather I do not use the E7 Headphones while walking except for mowing so far.

Lastly, I used the headphones on a commercial jet flight.  Again, I could still hear the jet engines but they became a much lesser background noise while in flight.  I could hear the significant positive difference when I switched on the noise cancellation switch.

The fidelity of the headphones is good.  The appearance and feel of them are excellent.  The storage pouch is a nice touch and the packaging is attractive.

The controls on the right earpiece is a triangle with various functions depending where you press and how long you press it.  To add to the complexity, the user would normally press the triangle without being able to see it.  To make it easier for me, I put a drop of heat melt glue on the bottom (+) corner of the triangle.  That way I could find my location on the triangle switch without removing the headphones.  Cowin make note you should put a bump on this corner in the future models.

I understand that Cowin makes an in ear noise cancellation ear buds that I would be willing to review for them.  For me it might solve the excessive warmth factor of the over the ear E7.  It might be better for lawn mowing and summer walks.

I hope that this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have and usually use in-ear type head phones. Sennheiser cx and creative which cost less than these and sound a lot better. And Panasonic $10 in ear which are comparable for sound quality

Sound quality is muffled and not very clear or crisp. Not hugely but noticeable. Music is less enjoyable

Noise cancellation is ok but doesn't justify the price of these there are better low end options from better brands. Dishwashers, fans, air conditioners are almost cut out completely. Higher frequencies like voices not cut out at all. Sometimes there is some oscillation/buzzing when a slight leak in the foam occurs from bending over or turning the head.

The Cowin E-7 is a beautifully crafted, very comfortable, noise cancelling headphone and the sound quality everything I had hoped for. It paired up quickly with my HP Laptop on the first attempt without any hesitation. The fit and finish is near perfect in my opinion. The attractive brushed aluminum frame is very attractive, well padded and oh so smooth to the touch.

There was no fading of sound and the battery seemed to be ready for several more hours of use. The volume control is smooth and adjusts easily. The sound remained clear, crisp and easy to listen to from the highest to the lowest volume setting.

And in some cases great, given the price.

PROs
Battery life: one of the best features. Haven't used them the 30 hours advertised without recharging, but the battery lasted all day on a recent airplane trip, and that was good enough for me.

Sound quality: These are not studio-level headphones, of course, but the sound quality is surprisingly good; nearly as good as the $300 Sony noise cancelling wired headphones these replaced. Good frequency response across the spectrum with a nice punch to the bass. I've not experienced the creaking, static, or sound cut-out that others have mentioned. I do a lot of walking and they hold up great, without any associated jostling sounds or lack of signal.

Noise cancelling: Not as good as my previously mentioned Sonys, but blocked out enough of the roar of the in-flight plane engine, or the NYC subway, which is mostly why I got them.

Comfort: Light, secure fit, ear muffs are comfortable for long use.

3.5mm audio jack: Nice feature that comes in handy when you want to avoid the bluetooth battery drain on your mobile phone or with devices without bluetooth.

Bluetooth: easy to pair with my iPhone and my MacBook (but disconnect it from your mobile phone’s bluetooth before pairing with the computer, otherwise it won’t show up).

Phone control: controls and mic work great in both wireless and wired modes with iPhone (though with some design caveats as outlined in CONs). I couldn’t get the headphones to work with FaceTime on the Mac, when I used it to answer my iPhone through the computer. However it did work well using video conferencing software through the computer.

CONs
Construction/design: Not saying they're not well constructed...only had them 2 weeks, so we'll see. But they feel a bit more destructible than my previous headphones. As mentioned, other reviews talked about creaking, broken ear cups, and other physical imperfections out of the box, which necessitated a return. I don’t have those problems, but I suspect that they may have to do with the overall flimsier construction: you're more likely to find a lemon.

Controls: Just bad design. There is a silver triangle on the right ear cup that has a raised LED light at the apex of the triangle, which is the play/pause/phone answer button. At the two base corners of the triangle are buttons that double as volume up/next song, and volume down/previous song.

The first dumb design element is that the volume up control is on the bottom corner of the triangle, the volume down on the top. Small thing, but it's just instinctual (UI Design 101!) to think “up/next” on top, and “down/previous” on the bottom.

But more egregious than that is fact that the volume/song controls are smooth, with no way to easily feel for them, except by a blind feel along the triangle until you get to the end. Further, to change volume, you have to press and hold. To change songs, you press and release. It's super easy to accidentally change songs when you mean to change volume (especially when walking). I have fumbled around with these controls so much that ultimately I decided to only use the volume/song controls on my iPhone itself where you have better overall control.

The play/pause/phone answer function works well, on the other hand, because the raised button makes it easier to feel blindly for.

CONCLUSION
As I said, so far so good. And for the price, these headphones are pretty spectacular. Likewise, if something happened to them I wouldn’t feel nearly as bad as if I'd paid $300. If Cowin fixed the bad control design, these would be pretty hard to compete with!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have never been able to wear headphones (as opposed to earbuds) for more than an hour or two without pretty bad discomfort due to my glasses and all cartilage jewelry I wear, but these fit perfectly over my ears even with all of that! I can easily wear them all day long and even forget they're on! On that note, the battery life is excellent. I rarely need to charge them, and I use them pretty often.

Also, the noise-canceling function actually WORKS. Obviously if you've around some very loud noise and your music is quiet it won't completely drown everything out, but it does work surprisingly well. I work in one of those ""open office"" settings where everyone is constantly talking, so I use the noise-canceling (sometimes even without music playing, just for the white noise) function to tune it all out, and it works like a charm.

I was encouraged by some audiophile friends to go with a better-known brand name (and pay a lot more money), but I'm glad I took a chance on these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The product does as described. The Noise Cancelling could be a little better, but it works okay. The manual could be a little more clear on how to turn on the noise canceling.

The sound could be improved, it does sound a little muffled and bass heavy when you don't use NC, once you turn on NC, it does get a little more tin-ier. After awhile though, you get used to it.

They are comfortable, seem well constructed, love that if the battery dies, I can just connect wired to my device.

I have an Apple TV 4 and LOVE that they connect and that the volume control for the ATV turns up the sound on my headphones. Love that the battery level is displayed on my iPhone as well. That is very handy to have to know where I am at for battery level.

All in all I am happy with it, could use some slight improvements, but it works for what I need it to do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I gave Cowin some time before purchasing but I needed a new pair just for my commute, so decided to get them.

Upon opening the packaging, everything is about expected for a new headphone set...all the attachments needed to get up and running. But, when I picked up the headphones, I was initially very disappointed with how the quality of this set felt in my hands. I'm not going to compare companies in my review, but I will say that I bought another pair, that, for the same price point, felt much heavier and was built a lot better. Moving on...

My sound drill is what sold me on these. I hooked them up via Bluetooth, NFC, and to my home PC. I have to say, I was highly impressed. The bass response is excellent in these! And if sound is what you're after, this is a great buy.

If you can get past how cheap they feel, and actually are, you're really going to enjoy the sound these headphones kick out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is they are a bit bigger and heavier than I expected. But I've never used noise cancelling headphones before, so maybe they aren't out of the normal range for these. I primarily use these for watching TV, audible books and music.

My situation is a little different than most people. I have had cochlear implants in both ears and my on-going rehab is to listen to audible books while I read along. I have an attachment that lets me stream into my cochlear implants, but the sound isn't right because I don't get the low sounds that come from my remaining natural hearing. But these headphones cover both my ears and the small microphones for the implant processors the sit in front of my ears and produce the best sound I could ever imagine.

I am once again able to listen to music and enjoy it!.

These headphones are reasonably priced so my expectations were not very high.

I just added photos AND checked my purchase history. I bought these LESS than a year ago.
I bought these headphones about a year ago.
I bought them to use at work in and open cubicle space, as well as, during my commute (public transit) and while traveling domestically and internationally.
Initially, I loved them. I was happy with the sounds quality, and so long as I remember to switch off the ANC when calls come in, I never had an issue hearing the caller or with them hearing me.
I use them everyday, and when I watch my 6 nieces and nephews, I set them up with their ipads and these headphones for car rides, etc.
However, last night while working and wearing these, all of a sudden I felt something move on my ear, then drop. The over-the-ear piece on one side broke and came apart! I've tried to put it back in place, and I tried to keep them on my ears despite this, but it is impossible. I'll have to replace them, but I've lost some trust in this product.
I understand it's a relatively inexpensive product and I have been using it everyday, but that should be taken into consideration when it is designed. I'm buying them to use them, why are they literally coming apart after a year?","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

We have a really big yard and I get really bored riding on the lawn mower for two or more hours at a time. I've tried using traditional in the ear earphones in the past and even with the music turned up as loud as I can get it I still can't hear it. These have worked perfectly. I can hear the music, and the sound of the lawn mower is muted; it's a fabulous way to mow the lawn. I have not experienced any issues with them even though once I'm done mowing they are completely covered in sweat. I merely dry them off and put them away til next time. These hold the charge extremely well. I think I only had to charge them once throughout the whole entire season. Now of course since I'm in Western New York, mowing season is only about 4 months. But still, using them at least once a week for two to three hours and only had to charge them once over a four-month period Is fantastic.

(Original Review)
these headphones arrived today and i have been using them for a little bit. first off i guess i'm no audiophile because i don't hear anything other than the music. i have no complaints about the low end, highs, mids.. and nothing seems to be ""bleeding"" together. the weight is more ""substantial"" compared to my other headphones but i enjoy that - they seem very well balanced and fit snug without being uncomfortable. the padding around the ears is very soft. i could see wearing them for extended periods.

i have not tried the noise canceling function yet because it's quiet in my office.

my previous pair of headphones were a pair of sony wired on-ear i picked up for $30. these sound better than those, are more comfortable because of the extra padding and being over-ear, plus i have no wire to deal with (my main criteria!).

they paired to my macbook pro 13"" with retina display no issues.

my only ""complaint"" is that the headphone's + / - button seem to be backwards. UP ( + ) is on the bottom and DOWN ( - ) is on the top. it would make more sense to me if that were reversed.

overall, pleased with the purchase. maybe problems will reveal themselves after more than a few hours.

1 Year Later...
So yeah, still very pleased with these headphones. I use them often for longer periods of time (2-3 hrs). They quickly switch between iPhone, iPad and 2 laptops without issue. The range seems to be pretty short, maybe 30 feet with no obstacles. I did take them with me on a trip to Europe and the battery lasted long enough (on and off use) to make it from Washington DC to Berlin with a layover (~15 hrs). I used the noise-cancelling function on the flights and it really does make a difference. It alters the music (makes it higher pitched maybe?) but I pretty much never heard the plane's engines.

All I can say is if you're on the fence, get them. You won't be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Cowin reached out to me and offered to send me their SE-7 noise-canceling headphones if I changed my review, or deleted it.  I told them if the headphones were good I would do so.  Why not?  I believe in second chances.

Well, the SE-7 is $20 more than the E-7, and they are the same garbage.  The noise-canceling doesn't work, the sound is crappy, not worth $89.  Save your money and buy yourself a set of Bose if you need a good set of noise-canceling headphones.  Due to this being their second chance and them coming up short once more, they went from two stars to one.  Plus the constant email harassment to delete my original review.

I wasn't going to write a review but I keep getting hounded to write a review or delete my original, so they asked for it.  Cowin needs to get their junk together.  See their email below.

1-the maximum volume is not high enough especially for gaming.
2-Also i have a thick neck so its not easy to walk around with them around my neck when i am not using them as they have a wide band.

I take online classes and listen to audio books to relax.  I have a massive music collection.  I can't tell you how many different headphones I've gone through over the last few years.  Actually I probably could since they were all ordered through Amazon.  Most of them start out nice, and then inevitably in about a month one speaker goes out and you are left with headphones that send sound to only one ear.

I have never used headphones more than I use this pair.  They have more than passed the test of time.  Additionally I find my daughters trying to copy me and wear them all the time.  Their toddler and infant hands have very little control so they get dropped.  Still they work perfect.

The noise canceling is remarkable.  I also like the fact that they don't require bluetooth you are welcome to plug them in old school.  I haven't tried it but it is one of the features of the headphones.

They connect no problem with my android phone, my ipad, my laptop, and my desktop.  Watching a movie with them is like being in the theater.  The sound is perfect, they are robust.  I will be sticking with Cowin whether it comes time to replace these or just get second pair.  I'd rather have a pair to travel with and a pair to keep at home just in case.

They game me a 99% off discount code and link to order a replacement on Amazon.com. After submitting my proof of purchase, they credited me for the 1% that I paid. The replacement unit arrived promptly and in full retail packaging. This was clearly a material, design, or manufacturing failure, which Cowin to their credit remedied with a replacement unit, no questions asked.

As for the headphones themselves, the sound is very good and they are very comfortable to wear. The noise cancellation works well with daily commuting on mass transit, long car trips, and on commercial airline flights. In the latter case, I was able to use the included 3 mm audio cable the seatback entertainment center with excellent results.

I was disappointed at the failure of these $65 headphones after just ten months of use, but pleasantly surprised at the efficient and professional customer service.

They are very easy to set up and connected with all my devices easily.  I'm not a very big fan of over the ear headphones because they are so bulky, which these are, but they are very comfortable.  The padding is very soft and they are adjustable so that they fit snuggly over my head without putting undue pressure on my glasses.  I am not an audiophile so would never consider spending the money for high end Beats or Bose headsets.  Having said that, I am more than happy with the sound quality.  I find the sound rich and vibrant.

I am a little annoyed at the controls.  The controls are not the same as the standard mic button controls for the iPhone.  The thing that annoys me the most about the button controls is that you can't access Siri through the buttons.

As for the noise cancelling technology, I am not sure what to expect since these are the first pair of headphones that I have purchased with this technology. And I have had them only for the weekend, testing them around the house.  The noise cancellation easily eliminates low pitch hums such as those produced by dishwashers, drier, washer, air conditioner, car engine, etc.  They do not, however, eliminate the repetitive sounds made, for example, by things such as the water swishing in the dishwasher or rapid clicking of the drier.  I later tested with a hairdryer and noticed no significant difference with the noise cancellation dis/enabled.  I bought these for air travel and have not had the chance to test them on a plane yet.  Hopefully they will cancel the engine noise sufficiently.

The last thing to note is that after using this for a short time, I noticed that I was getting a little dizzy and light headed.  A quick web search revealed that this is common with noise cancelling technology and that in most cases it resolves after using it for a while.  I hope that is the case for me.

Bottomline: These are solid headphones for the price.  I was actually looking for wireless headphones without noise cancellation.  I had expected noise cancellation to substantially increase the cost above what I wanted to pay. Then I came across these.  Given the good reviews and the added feature of noise cancellation, I decided to give it a try and am very pleased so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

1. Noise cancellation: ⭐⭐
It will dull loud bass noises like airplane engines to a decent quietness. However highs are completely ignored and come straight through. A crying baby, music and even conversations are easily audible with the active noise cancellation on.

2. Audio quality - ⭐⭐⭐
Highs are good, the bass is about average for a pair of headphones like these. You will find better bass with most ear buds. Audio clarity tends to be a. It muddled.

3. Build quality - ⭐
The plastic feels cheap and the button design could use some work. Think cheap 3rd party video game controllers and you'll get a good idea of how the buttons and material feel.

4. Battery life - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The only place where it shines. Its outstanding. I can't say how long the battery lasts. Because even with an entire day of heavy usage i've never had it die on me. I just charge it after 3-4 uses. I don't think ive ever gotten below 50% which makes sense since I've never used it for more than 5 hours in a day and the supposed battery life is 30 hours per charge.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The noise cancelling feature works like a charm! It's made the days pleasant and tolerable again.  The battery lasts forever, and the headset is light - I sometimes forget I'm wearing them.

I am a PhD student. The noise cancelling element is great and the bluetooth works very well. This allows me to pace comfortably around my apartment while thinking without having to worry about a cable or hear the traffic outside. As far as the range on the bluetooth, it goes for a few rooms, but gets choppy if I go to the other end of my apartment. It really isn't meant for distance. Keep your phone in the room though and it is great. Sound quality is acceptable, but these are certainly not recording studio quality.

Second, customer service: about 2 months after I purchased them the bluetooth stopped playing in the right ear. I checked and they still worked fine with the cable. I emailed the company that night and within 12 hours they had offered to replace them and sent me a coupon code that covered the cost. Now I have a new pair that works great and I still have the broken pair that just works with the cable. I didn't have to bother with shipping it back or anything. These guys kick ass.

So far, i appreciate this company’s helpfulness:

My first Review is at the bottom. The current review for this product is this one of the top.

2nd review..

So I bought these for my child for his birthday and he just recently opened up and started using them, battery is still great and last a long time, the sound on these things are good. However the second pair that I bought have an issue with them when you are using the microphone. It sounds like there is a lot of electrical interference and you can hardly hear the person that is using them while they’re speaking to you. We have tried this on multiple different Devices and are still having the same issue. The person on the other line is unable to hear clearly the person speaking using the microphone of these headphones. Unfortunately my return window is now closed as of August 1, please do not buy these in advance for a birthday if you are wanting to do that. If you’re going to buy these make sure you open them and use them immediately or you will have just wasted your money if the product does not work as advertised.

1st review..
Battery lasts FOREVER! No, not really forever.. but at full charge I listen to music almost all day (8ish hours) plus, I can’t hear my kids fighting in the background 👏🏽 AT 👏🏽ALL!!!

Sound is great, battery lasts, the mic works just fine, auto connect, loud noise canceling (even when listening to an audio book on a high volume)

All in all a great deal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Some headphones say 'noise isolating,' but I wasn't sure they would do enough, so I settled for the Cowin E-7.

First, the comfort is amazing. I can wear them for 8 hours without issue. It took me about a day to figure out how they should sit on my head, but once in position, they cover my ears do a good job of reducing ambient noise

Once you flip on the ""NC"" switch for noise canceling, you immediately notice where it falls short. Unlike more expensive units, these aren't reading the surrounding environment and generating a frequency to negate those sounds. Rather, they seem to produce a kind of fixed low frequency that feels like mild pressure in the ear and produces a kind of 'hissing static.'

The NC function will eliminate most low-frequency sounds (drone of the AC unit, footsteps, fingers hitting the keyboard of a laptop). Mids sounds further away (deeper voices, doors opening, moving things around on the desk). Highs come through mostly without any kind of reduction (laughter, people with higher voices, coffee cup set down.)

I wasn't sure what to expect with the NC function, but for the price, I'm not going to dock any stars because the Bose units cost considerably more. For the best experience, you are going to want to use the NC function and play some kind of background music. But if you want to remove all sound and not have to play music, I'd save for a set of Bose headphones.

I can't grade sound quality too harshly because my hearing is not tuned well enough to tell much of a difference between music playing at 96 kbps and 320 kbps. I will say that staging is really good - sounds meant to come from behind do sound like they are coming from speakers positioned behind the head; and vice versa with sounds from the front. Bass is okay. If you listen to hip-hop, you know that some boomy sounds can become distorted without a good subwoofer, and while the headphones mostly make a clean sound, some sounds break up. To me, the mids are really good and I think the highs hit all the right marks.

As for design, well, they are plastic. The chrome bit looks good at a distance but once up close you know where they saved money. If you want real metal, you have to pay for it. Personally, as long as the internals are good, I don't much care for the materials. Also, being plastic means they are relatively light. The 'leather' feels soft and there is loads of padding, especially with the part that sits on your head.

Be aware that these are not very low profile. Looking at the product image, they look smaller than they actually are. In reality, they are very wide.

The headphones connected to my laptop quickly enough, but if I switch them off then come back later and turn them on, sound won't come through until I turn them on and off a few times. I think the problem is the computer because they are 'paired,' but I can't be sure. It isn't a deal breaker.

No comment on battery life. They last a full 8 hours and you can plug them in while using them. Some peopel claim 40 hours, but there is no way to know how much battery life is left.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Without the noise cancelling the sound is completely different, sort of like listening to a very clean bass feed, a bit too vivid.  If you turn on noise cancellation, the bass dies down a bit, and the rest of the auditory frequency range comes to play, but it loses all definition and is unpleasant - almost an echo sound, boxed in.  Bottom line, the sound is not very good.  I will return it.

Update. After returning these headphones for a refund, I have received multiple overtures from the vendor asking me to change my rating from three stars to five stars. I was offered free headphones and doubled up refund. The final straw is when I was offered upgraded headphones if I would reconsider my position. I agreed to receive the new headphones and write a new review based on a truthful experience. The customer experience person then told me they would only ship the headphones if I FIRST deleted my review. I consider this kind of aggressive suppression of truthful reviews as a very unethical business practice. If they invested more in product quality and less in post customer experience and bullying, I would have given them a positive review to start with. Do not believe the positive reviews, they must be arrived at through unethical means because the product is very poor in quality. Please see credible reviews from CNET and others. You'll realize that apart from the many that get free stuff to say good things, this is a low quality product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

People are still talking on the phone, children are still screaming and there's no hope of escape.  These Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, however, are perfect for making that experience less tedious.

These headphones are bluetooth but they come with a regular audio mini-plug connector so you can use them in a device that still has a headphone jack. This is great because it means you can use it with multiple devices without having to sync it to bluetooth on every device.  Bluetooth connectivity is good and didn't drop any sound when turning my head from side to side like some headphones are prone to do.

The noise cancelling is great. I've had wired ANC headphones that didn't do the job as well as these bluetooth ones.  The audio is very good too, much better than many more expensive versions that I've also tried.

The headphones come with a small leather traveling pouch which is nice, but a hard-sided case is available on Amazon that would give the phones more protection if you're traveling a lot.  I haven't had any problems with the leather pouch but I do worry about losing the aux cable.

Excellent product, I will definitely buy again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They pair quickly and easily. I’m giving only 3 stars because the noise canceling isn’t that good. When I switch them to the NC setting without using music, a pc , or the like , I hear as much noise as if I had them off. When playing music, the NC setting works fairly well, but only if I have the volume 50 to 100 percent. I will keep them because of the sound , build , and style quality, but as far as noise canceling, I am not happy with the lack of being able to block out unwanted noise. The unit was fully charged so I cannot understand why I have to play music loudly to block out noise. I had high hopes that these would give me some peace and quiet with the NC setting on and being used alone or with music.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The build-quality is really impressive and the packaging was fancy. The sound quality is extremely good for this price range and I am happy with listening to music or podcasts. The bass is just right for me, but some may think it is a little light. For headphones it is better than you could expect.

AS FOR FIT/FEEl: These are the most comfortable headphones I have had. I am sure some of the super expensive ones are good too, but I have had several from this price range and a few that were about three times as much and these are the very best. They are wide enough if you have a big melon, like me, but snug enough that my wife can wear them on her notably smaller head.  The padding on the over the head crosspiece is nice and soft, but feels like you could accidentally rip it if you are overly rough with your electronics. To be fair, I have been using them a lot and have not been super careful, but mine is just fine.  My very favorite part about these headphones are the ear-cups. They are big enough to fit over my large ears without scrunching them up. I also wear glasses and the pads make a good seal without making my glasses uncomfortable.

The noise cancelling feature is nice, but it only works with quite low noise.  It works fine for commercial airline noise, but is not good enough for something like a small private plane. These would not be suitable for mowing either, but I did use them while trimming with a gas trimmer and it was okay for that, so it is a mid-range low noise that it works best for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They work well for the most part. In my bedroom when I tried them for the first time, there was a weird sound thing going on. I finally realized that somehow the ceiling fan and the frequency were colliding and I was hearing distortion matching the rotation of the fan. It was actually painful. If I reached up and touched the sides of the headset, the noise would stop. But, I wasn’t going to be sitting in my bedroom so I didn’t send them back (because they are really inexpensive for Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones. On to the plane I went. Started my show and there was none of that weird sound in my brain. Every now and then, if I turned my head to either side, I’d hear a little distortion, but staring directly at the screen, it was perfect. The noise cancelling is perfectly tuned for airplane noise. I could hear it slightly in the distance, but for the most part had a wonderfully full and loud listening experience. I watched “Bohemian Rhapsody” and forgot where I was and may have sung out loud in the plane once.

I'm impressed!","February 10, 2017","I just upgraded my iPhone and I wanted to buy myself an nice set of headphones as a treat. I listen to lots of music. I figured I'd look at the bose and the beats. Every time I did a search for noise canceling headphones these kept popping up. I'd look past them. But then they'd pop up again. The high end headphones are pretty expensive. So I figured I'd give these a try for $70. Worst case I'd send them back and buy something better. But WOW. THEY SOUND GREAT!  Nice and clear and crisp. Great range of sound.  Nice balance. Not too heavy. Great range at both ends of the sound spectrum. The noise canceling nicely lowers ambient sound. The headphones are light weight and very comfortable to wear. And the battery charge is great. They came charged. I've been listening here for 3 hours just relaxing. James Taylor. Boston pops. Trans Siberian orchestra. Garth brooks. I've tried a nice mix. I'm very pleased. They paired easily. Only annoyance as others mentioned is the volume controls are reversed. Top button lowers sound and bottom raises it. Very well made and comfortable to wear. They seem built to be quite durable and very high quality. They feel high quality in the hands and on the head. They even come with a storage bag. No charger. Only a cable. But they will charge from any USB charger.

Update over a year later. I'm still loving these headphones. I recently tried in a set of beats. And compared backnand forth. I'd argue these sound just as good. I'm still lovin them. Listen to music nearly every night and these are wonderful.

I wasn't sure from the description of there was a built mic for taking phone calls. But I've taken a couple calls here now and people seem to be hearing me no problem.

Now time to drag my butt out of the recliner. But what a nice relaxing time with a headphones that seem to work much better than one would expect from the price. Definitely a keeper. Maybe I'll go after a high end pair some day. But for now these seem to work wonderfully.

Update 2/15/17. WOW. I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!  The sound is wonderful. I have many hours in them now. They are comfortable to wear. They are very well made. They are built heavy enough to not feel cheap. But not heavy on head at all. Music is wonderfully clear. Highly recommend these. Seem to be far better performance than I expected for the price.

The instructions are anemic and no help at debugging.

I get a single blue flash every two seconds.  And five flashes every 60 seconds.  The five flashes are matched with a super irritating chime.  It's loud.  I can still hear the beeping even with the headphones wrapped in a towel and thrown in a steel drawer.

I took a day off from the office leaving the headphones on my desk.  It irritated my coworkers all day long.  Embarrassing.

No way to turn the headphones off.  No way to charge the headphones.  The ""user replaceable"" battery is protected by a hologram/label which I assume breaking invalidates the warranty.

There's no way to stop the beeping.  I tried laying them flat on the headphones.  The ""noise canceling"" technology knocked off a decibel or two (as in, did nothing).

And just to rant at a whole new level...  Every pair of bluetooth headphones I've owned play warning chimes through the speakers.  This is the first pair that does it relentlessly, whether the device is on or off.  I know in the grand scheme of things, who cares, first world problems, wah.

The sound quality is good. I mainly listen to audio books so I don't need great sound. They are comfortable. I've worn them for a few hours at a time and not had any issues.

The mic is crap. The 1 person I tried to talk to with them on could only hear 30% of what I said. Those were his actual words. So for music/audio books they are great.

I was quite excited to find these headphones- they were reasonably priced, had good reviews overall, and did not look cheap. They arrived quickly, UNFORTUNATELY the headphones were broken upon arrival. The right speaker does not work nor does the bluetooth option work. I gave it two stars for now because it is comfortable and the customer service seemed willing to work to fix the problem, waiting to hear back from them. Hope to get this fixed soon.

(EDIT 1) 9/14/2018: After dealing with Cowin customer service and receiving a new product I'm going to bring it up to 4 stars. The headphones are working well, the sound seems to be well balanced between the highs and mids the bass is kind of struggling. But overall it is a great bang for your buck.  Now customer service was good,, they handled the problem quickly and efficiently.  Happy with the transactions.

(Edit 2) It's been approximately 4 months and the product is still working well. My only issue with it right now is that it does not stay on my head during workouts, but they aren't an athletic headphone so it is to be expected.

I had done some research and was excited to find a product that appeared to work almost as well as the gold standard of Bose at a fraction of the price.  I was not expecting perfection, I was hoping for good audio and comfort from noise cancellation on LONG overseas flights.  At first all went well.  Charged well at home and appeared to work wonders with noise cancellation and sound was good on my iPhone, my iPad and my computer, not that my computer was going on a backpack trip to Frankfurt and Paris.  On the flight to Frankfurt, all went well, the noise cancellation worked perfect and the sound from my iPhone and the plane audio was good.  Got to Frankfurt and tucked it away till I needed it again.  Traveled in a case designed specifically for Cowin headphones and all seemed well.  Traveled to Paris, no problem.  Charged it the night before we were heading home.  Light came on to indicate charge and all seemed well until I got on the plane and tried to hook up to the audio on the plane.  Noise cancellation still worked, but it did not matter the cable I used, and I tried THREE cables, the audio did not work from the plane, from my iPhone or from my iPad.  It appears that I am out of the return window for Amazon, so I am S.O.L. and not really happy, but glad that I did not spend THAT much money.

The noise canceling actually surprised me. To test them I tried speaking to someone with them on. They work better than some earplugs that I've used in the past.

This is the first Bluetooth headphones I've owned so I experimented a bit with them. The signal will go 20' through 2 walls before it starts getting garbled up, at 30' you have no sound. I'm not sure how far it will go unobstructed though my home has too many walls in the way.

The life expectancy will vary depending on whether or not you leave them on all day or not. The longest I have had these going is about 8-12 hours non-stop while I played a game on a weekend. If I get a low power tone after 12 hours, which goes off quite often until you plug it in. Which is helpful for alerting you to the fact they are about to die, but rather aggravating to listen to.

If the headset dies it comes with a cord to plug into your computer via USB port to charge it back up, which takes 30 min to an hour. Considering how long they run between charges I don't mind waiting another hour before using them again.

These headphones also have a auxiliary port for non blue tooth listening. This works just as well as the blue tooth. I personally feel like the cord is a bit short though.

The buttons on the side work depending on what you are doing and in what application. Music you can turn up or down or skip the song. It doesn't seem to have any affect on videos.

All in all I love these head phones and recommend them since they can be worn for longer periods of time without hurting your ears, and the noise cancelling part makes every thing way quieter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

And I do not think that the Bose headphones are defective either, but after getting this pair and comparing the sound, I think that the Bose pair may be over-hyped and consequently overpriced.

It's kind of like the situation with Reebok's, Nike's, and Beats earphones. As long as the brand has enough street-cred among a certain clientele, a ""classiness"" label gets attached to the brand and a higher quality rating becomes more a result of assumption rather than objective evaluation against less-known peer brands. I don't really blame so much the customers for this though as I do marketing departments.

On another hand I do not know how long these will last; they seem sturdy but considering the nice sound quality for a much lower price, I thought perhaps they wont last as long as the Bose pair.

Cowin actually called me on the phone and offered to make this right without any money out of my pocket. This is some of the best customer service that I have received in a day and age where it has become sell the product and forget the customer. So make it right they did. They sent me a pair of the E8s. So here is my review for those..

E8s.. right out of the box you can tell these are built better than the E7s.. They are really comfortable and not too heavy. noise cancelling is much better with these. Now I run a DJ business and have multiple headphones. So where to compare these. I like these better than the Beats for comfort and sound wise not much difference. Not as much bass but you can edit that with a good equalizer. For the price point these are really good head phones. Are they my favorite.. no.. I have a pair of Audio Technica that I love and paid way too much for.. But these are a close second..

My only comparison that I have to these are a pair of BOSE quiet comfort 35 ii. These head phone obviously preformed slightly less and the aforementioned, but so much better than I was expecting.

I bought these ANC headphones becuase I recently started working on solo projects at work in a call center and needed to block some of the chatter out.These headphones did just that!

They don't cancel out the direct talking within 5 to 10 feet, but they do dramatically reduce (75-80 percent) the further away conversations. And this is what they are advertised to do.

The sound quality is great. I have messed with any we settings on my phone and it sounds like the conversations from the podcast I listen to are happening right there by me.

Bluetooth pairing is a breeze and the connect is amazing. Without barriers the headphone stay solidly connected over 150 feet from my phone.

Battery life on these is phenomenal. I would have been pleased with 10 hours or so, but I have gotten around 3 times as much. (I started to record exactly how long, but after about 20 hours I stopped) I listen to podcast that are over an hour long and was easily able to make it through 25 before it made it to the low battery beep. I have repeated this again and again all the while with ANC on.

On to comfort. I wear these headphones off and on for 8-10 hours a day at work. I have worn them a couple time for 4 hours straight and the whole time there was no discomfort or pains.  The ear cushions are nice and padded and the band is well covered too.

Pros:
Battery life
Sound quality
Noise cancelling
Quality packaging

Cons:
Slightly cheaper materials
Fingerprints show on the shiny surfaces

I am going to be purchasing a pair of these as a gift for someone soon and if I ever have to replace mine, I will definitely look back at these or COWIN's other offerings!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Noise cancelling... Noise cancelling feature blocks out most noises. I wore these on a long flight watching movies. Simply putting them on made things quiet. When I flipped on the noise cancelling feature it silenced about 75% of background including the plane engines. But certain tones cut right through the high tech feature. I could hear this lady talking clearly while everything else was silenced.  I am sure you can spend a ton of money and get a better pair but for the price these are a good deal.
.
Quality... these are well made with soft leather pieces. Adjustable to your head size. Even comes with a leather bag. I am not sure about the 30 hour battery life claim but they did last me more than 10 hours no problem. Maybe they still had another 20 hours? I am sure they would be destroyed if you gave them to a child. But for an adult who takes care of things I dont see them breaking.
.
Functionality... these are a bit bulky but that is the nature of this type. Controls are simple enough. But I can't figure out why you push and hold the down button to turn music up. Seems backwards to me but that's a minor thing. The bluelight being on constantly is annoying but a good reminder that you have left these on when you take them off.

I was in the market for noise canceling headphones, as I travel a lot for work, but I was not willing to spend top dollar for them. (mostly because I was not convinced I would be able to tell the difference.)
The Cowin E-7 Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Over-ear Stereo Headphones - Black is a less expensive version of noise canceling headphones and so far I am really enjoying them.

Size, Style, Comfort:
These headphones are adjustable in size and easy to store away for travel since the ear pieces turn to make the headphones flat. I found the cushions of the headphones to be extremely comfortable. In terms of style, I think they are subtle and get the job done. They are not making a fashion statement, but they still look good when you are wearing them.

Price, Durability:
I 100% recommend these headphones for their price--especially if you are in the market for good quality headphones and do not care about having the top brand. I found the headphones to be very light (Great for traveling!) but not as if they were about to break. I will check back in September after my first trip with them.

Ease of Use:
Since I have the Iphone &, i was specifically looking for a pair of Bluetooth noise canceling headphones (I find this much easier than trying to keep track of the small little converter.) The instruction manual that came with the headphones was simple and easy to follow, I was able to set it up on my phone and laptop. I really liked the sound quality and found that they canceled noise compared to normal headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Minutes after leaving my review, customer support reached out and offered to send a complimentary pair. Initially I thought from their email that it would be a different pair, however I received the exact same pair. Regardless, it was kind of them to quickly send a second pair as they definitely did not have to do so.

-----------------------------------------------
I purchased these before going out of town on a 3 hour flight, and was initially encouraged after reading the previous reviews. Unfortunately my experience was completely underwhelming. I put them on for the first time outside while waiting for the train to the airport, and was immediately disappointed in the overall quality.

These headphones function as they should, but are by no means ""great"". Multiple reviewers indicate that they are comfortable around the ears for at least 1-2 hours; I found the reverse, they squeeze tightly almost immediately. The inside area (where your ears should comfortably fit) is small, which means the cushion will overlap part of your ear and squeeze it. I saw several reviews that mentioned these were great for large heads. I don't think my head is abnormally large, but I wanted to err on the side of caution (I'd rather have too much room than not enough). They do not extend out much at all, and the more you extend the tighter the squeeze will be.

Now, on to sound quality. Noise cancellation is a solid 4. Not the best, but they certainly reduced the amount of ""noise pollution"" on the flight. There is minimum base, which always is a disappointment. I don't need the bass to be so strong that my brain is vibrating, but I don't want my music to sound like talk radio either. Volume was also an issue, as on and off the plane the maximum volume is low (I'm also not hard of hearing).

Charge time: I charged the headphones overnight the evening before flying out, and they held a charge for the duration of my trip (5 days).

Phone conversation: My friend was able to hear me relatively well through the bluetooth speaker while have a phone conversation, so 5 stars for that at least.

Summary: These are top of the line for headphones in the cheaper range maybe, but I wouldn't purchase them again, especially not for the price I paid. I have some wired headphones that I bought on Groupon for $30 (link included) that are old but have much better sound quality and extend further; the only sorta-issue is the cord, but they are much better quality than these.

I can wear them all day at work and they are very comfortable. The noise cancellation is very good. It completely tunes out other noises in the office.

I have 2 minor complaints, but doesn't take away from a great pair of headphones.

1) The volume up/down buttons seem to be reversed. I hold down up to turn the volume down and vice versa. (Also, I wish skipping songs was holding it down and volume was tapping, but not a big deal)

2) While the bass and mid tones are very very good, I wish there was slightly more treble from them. Again they still sound amazing, but I'm just being really picky.

Would recommend them to anyone and would absolutely buy again

Bluetooth Headphones come in all shapes and sizes and within this range of products come products that fit an ear perfectly and comfortable. So would be the description of these pair of headphones. Here is a full written description of the main aspects of this headphone.

Price:
The price seems quite reasonable for the battery life and the soft ear cups.

Build Quality:
The build quality is perhaps overly sturdy as the swivel frame is made out of thick materials. This is also the point which is a weakness for many headphones. This is so because the ear cups are rotated quite a lot of times meaning that a good construction of this area results in better quality:

Sound Quality:
The sound quality is decent but surely isn't an audiophile level product. The treble and the bass have a decent combination but there could have been a little more bass. The noise cancellation feature is quite decent and works to cancel out background noise.

In Conclusion I recommend this product for its long battery life, and good construction quality.

However, only after a few months, the right ear started to come loose. The plastic inside had just worn out. I tried to deal with it, but it couldn't even stay on my ear.
Not long after, I decided to give them another chance, and I bought another pair.
That was a mistake. The exact same thing happened (this time on the left ear), and it broke even quicker than the last ones.
They weren't mishandled. I was just walking and the left ear popped out.

Best decision I've made. These worked surprisingly well. There was an annoying child on the plane who kept speaking loudly and crying for the majority of the flight (you know the usual, the child who's damn parents refuse to tell them to shut the heck up)!! Anyway, once I realized what was happening, I took these bad boys out, put them over my ears, plugged in the a/v cord that came with them into the tv screen on the plane, and that was the last I heard of that annoying child. Moreover, the best part, the headphones blocked out the noise from the plane and also stopped my ears from clogging. I was extremely surprised by how effective they are.

On a questionable note, I have used them on Bluetooth mode to listen to music and watch videos on my computer. I noticed that sometimes it drops the connection. I am not sure if that is an issue with my computer or the headphones so I will continue to monitor the situation. However, b/c I bought them for their noise cancellation abilities and b/c they work great in that regard, I am not lowering my rating for the Bluetooth issue.

At the 7-month mark, they broke. The plastic holding the right speaker broke so it was only being held together by the speaker cable.

My wife threw away the headphones after a week, so I thought I was out of luck. I contacted Cowin anyways and explained the situation. They decided to replace my headphones free of charge, so I now have a new set coming. YEAH! Thanks Cowin.

So, I wanted buyers to know that even if you feel a little shaky about trying Cowin out, I think their customer service has your back.

Regarding quality, this isn't Bose, but it doesn't have to be. The noise cancellation is superb and the battery life is excellent. I sometimes go an entire day without charging them. Now, that doesn't mean I am listening to audio the entire day, but I've had flights that totalled to 17+ hours of travel. Having the ability to cancel out the ambient noise of an airplane cabin is a God-send.

There are two flaws that I have to share for future models. The blue LED light is bright in the dark, so if you are sleeping with a partner, they may have to deal with a blue light blinking while you wear them. The other improvement I would make is in the microphone quality. I was excited to know that I could answer calls with the headphones, but people on the other side can't hear me very well. I decided to stop using the headphones for calls.

Other then that, I think you will find it very difficult to find headphones of equal quality at this price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I highly recommend this if you are a college student just because it really does block out the background noise so you can focus on your homework. Its amazing. I am so happy I got these headphones.

As for customer service. It is out of this world!! The left side of my headphones recently stopped working. Sometimes I would not be able to hear on my left ear and sometimes I would. So I contacted customer service about it and they were extremely understanding. So understanding that they sent me another pair of headphones! I was amazed because these aren’t cheap headphones!

I purchased these along with a hard shell case.  For 6 months these were amazing.  I had two coworkers buy them after trying them out.  We loved them.

Things didn't begin to go south after 6 months.  All 3 pairs (including my coworker's headphones), broke due to a design flaw at the swivel point just above the ears.  The small threaded pin that holds them in place and allows them to swivel stripped, causing the headphone to fall apart.

I increased my rating from 1 star to 3 stars for this reason, as the representative was very sweet and accommodating (Thank you, Lexi). I do not support the philosophy of this company, however, as they tried to coerce me into deleting my negative review for a free pair of upgraded headphones. Whereas I do appreciate the upgraded headphones I received (still not the greatest quality), I thought that was very duplicitous and could not in good faith support that kind of deception- especially as a customer who purchased this item BECAUSE of all the great reviews. That being said, if you are willing to spend a little more money but still not as much as a pair of Beats etc., Cowin's E8 headphones are a much better option (warning: they beep every time a song skips, every time you touch your phone screen, get a notification, touch a control button etc).

Original Review:
Oh my god I want to cry. I bought these headphones as a gift for my brother, who fortunately finds no issue with them (he is so excited to have wireless earmuffs) but when I tested them out for myself I immediately noticed they were NOT worth the sale cost. The basic Apple headphones I received with my iPhone 8 were better than these, and audiophiles do not speak very highly of Apple headphones.

So disappointed. Will not be purchasing anything from Cowin in future.

Pros:
- Looks very stylish (silver details are plastic however, not metal)
- Came with a soft carrying case
- Contributes toward UNICEF fund
- Simple to use
- Very comfortable

Cons:
- Sound is distorted (WHY COWIN, WHY? Is my item broken or what???)
- LoFi audio (Sounds like cheap dollar store quality)
- Noise cancellation is very minimal
- EXPENSIVE for the above mentioned issues.

These headphones should not be marketed as HQ/HD music headphones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They are not noise-cancelling.  I still hear every single word coming from the television while my husband watches TV.  Purchased them in early June. It is now mid-November, not yet 6 months, and they are falling apart. One ear piece keeps dangling; I keep pushing it back in, yet it continues to react to gravity and begin to dangle.
The Pro: They are comfortable on the ears, if hot.  The are easy to pair and remain connected. They hold a charge reasonably well.
Conclusion:  Granted, I paid only $62.99 compared to those available for hundreds of dollars but that $62.99 is pretty pricey for me. I'd say that averaging at a cost of $12.60 a month is wasteful. Didn't even get a full six months out of them. Don't buy.

I'll just look for a different pair.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I sent mine back immediately when I saw that the headphones need to be powered on to work with the direct cable connection. Why? A direct cable connection should have the option of working without power (and without noise cancelling), like Audio-Technicas.

Now my son's headphones quit. They connect easily via Bluetooth, but there is sound only from one side, it is intermittent and distorted. I see no physical damage. It is too late to send them back to Amazon. Noise cancelling never worked.

On the pro side, they look okay (a bit garish for me), are fairly comfortable, and have a reasonable battery life.

But, they are junk. I made a warranty claim, but I do not think they are worth more than the cost of return postage, even if I got a brand new pair (and the warranty allows them to send refurbs).

I find it hard to believe all the 5 star reviews are legitimate.

I am raising my review from one star to three stars because the company sent me a brand new replacement E7 and E8 when I initially complained. Both at no cost to me. I have not had a chance to test the replacement E7 or the free E8. When I do, I may revise this review again.

The best bang for your hard-earned buck.","March 28, 2019","These headphones are an amazing deal. I have tried many brands ranging from Bose to Senheisser to Beats and not a single one of them offer a combination of noise cancelling and sound quality this good at this price.

Noise Cancellation: They won't be able to block that annoying coworker that's driving you nuts with his obnoxiously loud voice. However, they will completely make disappear that droning a/c unit noise. I tried them on a 6 hours plane flight and while I was at the first row of the plane, they were able to cancel at least 50% of the engine noise which in turn helped reduce fatigue. So for sort of whiteish noise, they work great. For others, you are better off with earplugs.

Sound Quality: These E7s can really pump some deep base notes. I tried to push their limits playing Mannheim Steamroller's Tocatta which it handled effortlessly. Same with Tag Team's Whoomp! There it is! However, I noticed that while the bass notes can make your head shake, the mid-ranges are muffled and the high notes lack punch and a bit of sparkle to them. These are not audiophile-grade headphones. But then again, they were not intended to be!

Battery life: The rumors are true! It lasts a long, long time. The 30 hour estimate from the manufacturer is on the conservative rather than the optimistic side.

Comfort: The earcups allow me to wear them for around 4 hours intervals without any significant discomfort. The headband feels soft to the touch and they have a very distinctive black chrome look to them for those always important aesthetics thats gives them an air of sophistication. The buttons for volume are arranged in a confusing fashion, tho with down for upping the volume and viceversa.

Value: Excellent! There is no better mix of features, quality and affordability at any price point than this. When you factor in that to get better noise cancellation or sound quality you have to spend sometimes double or triple the cost of the E7s, then it becomes hard to justify spending more. These headphones may not be perfect, but they are perfect for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I didn't know they were so great until a few days ago when I was looking for him. I seriously looked in every room of the house and called his name several times... Eventually I found him when I was putting up laundry, hiding in the closet, watching a movie with the headphones on! He was baffled that he didn't hear me calling so we had to do a few tests to make sure it was the headphones and not selective listening. Sure enough, with the volume on medium, neither one of us could hear the other calling from one room away! For us this is an absolutely amazing benefit!

I'm glad I did get a replacement because I am a pretty big fan of these headphones. They're super comfortable and the battery life is incredibly good, even for someone like me who's a super heavy headphone user. The sound quality is also quite good, especially for a cheaper pair of bluetooth headphones!

If I had one complaint it would be the noise cancellation - it certainly leaves a lot to be desired. Not only does it produce a fairly noticeable drop in sound quality when it's turned on, it also doesn't feel like it blocks out a whole lot more background noise than when you're just listening in the regular non-noise cancelling mode.

The sound quality is fairly good, but it’s not a breathtaking feeling when putting them on. Also, the noise canceling was a little disappointing if you’re looking for something to wipe out the sounds of a tv or busy office. However, if using them for music they do a fairly decent job of blocking out noise with the volume a decent way up, and the Bluetooth works great with anything that has a dedicated Bluetooth adapter or a mobile device.

The quality of the body is perfectly fine, and they’re great over large ears. After 5 months they are still comfortable and with decent care they’ve held up like new.

Overall it’s a 4.5 considering the price, but I still wouldn’t give it a 5 due to the lack of proper sound canceling and bass quality.

- I was offered a full refund on the condition that I delete this review. Keep that in mind when looking at the average rating.
------------------------------

These headphones seem pretty great at first. The sound quality is pretty good for the price, the noise cancelling works pretty well, and even the battery lasts pretty long.

So let's talk about what's not great...

First of all, the customer service from Cowin. I contacted them about this issue and heard nothing back, so it's time for an honest review.

These headphones suck, unless you're sitting still. They cannot withstand even the smallest amount of shock without cutting out. Riding the bus, walking too fast, you name it - they'll cut out. It's only for a fraction of a second, but when it happens every time the bus hits a small bump (not even a pothole) or when you start walking too fast (the harder you step the more they cut out) it gets pretty annoying.

I'll update this posting if customer service ever gets back to me. Perhaps I got a bad pair, but I've always taken care of them (I even bought a hard case for them and have never dropped them) so it's definitely no fault of my own that I own crappy headphones.

The sound quality is great, I think the noise-cancelling feature is pretty good. I'm trying out this pair and also SkullCandy's Crusher Wireless headphones, which is around $105-$150, to see which one I like better and here's what I've found:

- SOUND QUALITY: The sound quality is pretty much equal among both pairs. They sound slightly different, but I can't tell which one sounds better to me than the other. The sound quality slightly decreases in COWIN's pair when the noise-cancelling feature is turned off, but that's easily fixable by simply turning the feature on.
- NOICE-CANCELLING: Although COWIN's pair labels itself as noise-cancelling and SkullCandy's pair is more passive, I think the noise-cancelling feature among both pairs is almost equal. The only difference is that COWIN's sounds a bit like this soft fuzzy noise (like air) so I can actually *hear* noise-cancelling happening, and I have the option to turn it off and on. Turning it off slightly decreases the sound quality. With SkullCandy's pair, its noise-isolating feature is kind of like a default feature where I don't even need to turn the headphones on because the ear muffs are secure enough to my head that it blocks out enough noise on their own that it almost matches up with COWIN's pair's own noise-cancelling feature, which actually needs to be turned on. I like the noise-cancelling quality equally among both pairs, however I have a slight preference for COWIN's pair. When I wear the headphones and I talk and clear my throat, I can hear that the sound is more muffled out by COWIN.
- SOUND LEAKAGE: Both headphones have a tiny bit of sound leakage when I play my music at around 50%, however I've noticed that COWIN's pair leaks significantly more sound than SkullCandy's. I don't like it when people around me are able to hear what I'm listening to, especially since I'm a pretty anxious person, so this really has me leaning toward SkullCandy for now.
- DESIGN: I like the sleek-looking design of COWIN's pair, it looks more modern and overall aesthetically pleasing for me. The location of the volume buttons on the surface of the right ear muff is nice, although I think it's a little inconvenient that the volume-increasing button is on the bottom of the panel and the volume-decreasing button is up top, as opposed to the other way around. They also don't seem to work when I use them, so I have to adjust the volume on the device I'm connected to. I also don't really like how the power switch on COWIN's pair is on the very bottom of the hard part of the ear muff, it's a little difficult for me to find at times. With SkullCandy's pair, the buttons are on the backs of the ear muffs where a person typically puts their thumbs when they grab the ear muffs, so it's much easier to find those buttons without having to feel around.
- COMFORT: Although COWIN's pair also allows you to adjust the height of the ear muffs, it feels very loose compared to SkullCandy's pair. I think that's why it might have more sound leakage. When I wear COWIN's pair, it feels like it could fall off much easier both with the ear muffs and the area that fits around the top of my head. SkullCandy's pair feels much more secure, and their ear muffs don't wiggle around as much. They stay in place better and they fit my head and ears much more snugly. Because of this, SkullCandy's pair feels much more physically comfortable for me.
- OTHER NOTES: When you power the headphones on and off, I like the little high-tech beeps that I hear on COWIN's pair in comparison with SkullCandy's weird ""power on/off"" voice. This is just an aesthetic preference. SkullCandy's pair has adjustable bass though, so if you're listening to a song whose aesthetic lies strongly in its bass, I think SkullCandy's ability to let you adjust that really helps.
- PRICING: I think the overall quality has me leaning slightly more toward SkullCandy's Crusher Wireless pair, however the pricing for COWIN's pair is something I really can't ignore. For two pairs of headphones that are very similar in quality (in my opinion), the fact that COWIN is so much more affordable is what's giving me such a hard time really deciding which pair I want to keep and which one I'll end up returning.

I'll keep trying both of these headphones while I'm still inside the return window, so as I come up with new opinions, I'll be sure to update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Original Review:
First off, when writing reviews I make sure to give the product a thorough try first. At first, I had no real issue with it, then, today I went for a ride in the car trying out Noise Cancellation so I could hear my music over the engine.. The noise cancellation kept making a crackly ""wind sound"" as if it was damaged or something. I figured I would be able to hear it in the car well, but it does not work... I do not recommend this device if you actually want noise cancellation. The bluetooth [without it] is mediocre.

I am unsure what to do about it from here, it is having problems working so I don't know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Having said that, the Corwin E7s still have a pretty high sound quality and I prefer over the ear headphones to ear pods.  I can hear a difference when listening to speech, but with music, not so much.  I like to wear the Bluetooth headphones when I exercise, or am working in the garage or outside in the yard.  Or, any time where movement is involved and a wired headset can be restrictive.  I like to listen to all kinds of music (rock, jazz, blues, classical, techno, metal, etc.), mainly instrumental,  and usually connect them to streaming music stations on my iPhone.  They aren't a super light headset, but are very comfortable to wear for long periods.  Excellent overall frequency response, especially in the lower registers.  I don't know how long they will run on a charge, but I charge them once a week and have never had them go dead on me yet.  The noise canceling feature is ok.  It attenuates outside sound but not on a scale like a Bose, for example.  If that's important to you, then to get a little bit more noise canceling, be prepared to pay a lot more.  Nonetheless, this headset has a very high quality sound, especially for a wireless, and it's cost is a bargain for what you get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Although","June 28, 2017","These are fantastic! Although, I wish it had more bass the sound is really pretty good...and I feel this may be a little bit of an understatement.  Everything is clear and the noise cancelling is on par to my husband's BOSE earphones.  I had him sing a song while wearing them and had the TV on and I couldn't hear a thing except the music coming out of the earphones.  If you're on the smaller side, they are a little big but not anything too annoying to deal with.  Over the ear headsets are on the bigger side anyway.  I got these yesterday and wore them for about 2 hours, the only thing that worries me is when you adjust the earphones or take a heavy step (like going down stairs) while audio is playing, there is noticeable static like a wire is loose or something. I don't know if all of these do this or just mine but if you're thinking about wearing these to work out with just keep that in mind, there may be a little static when/if running or doing cardio.  It goes away instantly once adjustments have been made or you're walking normally. So weight training-yes cardio-maybe.  I read a lot of reviews on here and I haven't read this to be a problem so I think it just might be me.  The materials are decent quality especially for the price so I'm hoping they last me a decent amount of time.

They can definitely stand toe to toe with Bose in terms of sound quality.  They sound exactly the same as the $350 wired Bose headphones I use for private listening on my Roku. Great headphones for listening to the music!  Active noise cancelling silences ambient sounds.  The ONLY thing Bose does better, is block out noise from loud neighbors.  My upstairs neighbor stomps like an elephant and my Bose headphones tune out the high decibel noise of stomping completely. The Cowin E7 muffles the sound, but doesn't eliminate it completely.  But that aside, if you are just using the noise cancelling feature for music and not for stomping neighbors, Cowin is just as good as Bose for less than half the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They do seem to be very well built. I have not been able to try the noise cancelling in a noisy environment, so no comment on that. I am disappointed. To me, the number one reason to buy headphones is for an increased quality of sound over other in-ear or speaker options. My biggest complaint is the low-fi quality of sound. It is not very dynamic, kind of muffled and dull. Music has no sparkle or separation. In other words, instruments and voice, which occupy different frequencies within the sound curve, are all reduced to the same lower frequency within the sound curve. Based on the reviews, I expected the sound quality to be better than it is. I went into my iPhone music settings and tried to increase the treble, or decrease the bass, but it didn't have any effect on the headphones. I tried them on iMac and the sound quality was no different from my iPhone. The sound quality is not as good as my $5.00 imitation, wired earbuds, nor my inexpensive Bluetooth earbuds. If you are looking for a good quality of sound, look elsewhere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wear hearing aids and I just got tired of needing to remove them before using earbuds, and then having to put them back in when I was done. A minor inconvenience, but it gets annoying after a while. I was hoping that these would fit over the ear with room to spare, and they accomplish this nicely.
The sound quality is excellent for the price, as for the noise cancelling, I honestly can't tell much of a difference, with it switched on or off...there enough padding that it already blocks off a decent amount of ambient sound, so I mainly leave it turned off.
My only real complaint is that after wearing them for 45 minutes or more, my ears are very hot and sweaty, but I doubt that this could be helped due to the very nature of the design and style.
Overall, a great value, and since I didn't want to spend $200 on headphones, it does all I want for a price I could afford.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The headphones work fine when Bluetooth (BT) is on, but not during Active Noise Canceling (ANC). During ANC, one of the headphones crackles loudly to the point where it hurts my ears and you can't hear other audio. I can tell that ANC would work great otherwise since the other side still functions without the static. I'm really disappointed and debating on whether to return these and buy something else, or try to get another pair that possibly functions. Hopefully this is a fluke because I really liked this pair.

EDIT (09/26): I charged these headphones for a couple of days and I'm not sure what happened, but suddenly ANC is working. There's no static anymore, which is great. I have decided to cancel my return (fingers crossed not impulsively). I've been listening to music the last few hours while writing a paper for class and have no complaints. I'm very pleased with the sound quality now. Glad that some black magic happened and I don't have to fuss with sending them in for now.

Bluetooth pairing is simple, and they stay linked after the initial hookup.  They fit well enough for what I do, but I can see where they wouldn't be tight enough for jogging.
I like the ability to move ahead or back, but I don't like that it's the same buttons as volume up and volume down.  Half the time I skip songs instead of changing the volume.  Takes some getting used to.  I'm also having trouble with the volume control.  I don't know if its me, the source, or the headphones.  In case it's me, I set the volume on max on the headphones and adjust the volume on the source instead.  I've had times when I can't hear what's being played, and I can't seem to turn the volume up on the headphones.  When I get them home in a stable environment, they work fine.

They synced no problem with both of my phones, and the buttons to control the volume or stop and play the music work great with my phone and Amazon music and the Relax Melodies app.

Yesterday, I opened my headphone case and found that they had broken.  The articulating piece on one side is plastic, and had sheared off.  I emailed the seller through Amazon, and by the end of the day, I had a code to order a new set for free!

I use these headphones on airplanes, in the airports, and at work.  They really cut down on the extra noise.  The first time I wore them on a flight, I decided to take them off because it didn't seem that noisy on the plane.  I immediately put them back on.  I was amazed at how much quieter it was with them on.

They stay on my head really well, and I have difficulty getting hats or anything else to stay on.

Reviewed after several weeks use.","November 6, 2019","These are not comfortable on my head. Very tight in general fit wise. The ear muffs are smaller than my ears so my ears do not fit comfortablely inside the muffs.

Sound qaulitly for playback (like listening to music or incoming call qaulity is really good. Surprisingly good bass.

The mic is very very sensitive so everyone I talk to (phone calls etc) complains of a wierd waterfall (like constant rush of sound) effect from the mic. To the point where some people aske nicely not to call them from this headset. I cut foam from a wind/pop gaurd and jammed it into the mic port. It helped some but people I call still have issues.

The design for the buttons is not intuitive. The on switch is a slide toggle that is hard to locate if you are wearing them. I almost always have to take them off and look for the switch to turn them on. I have yet to figure out the other controls as they are a bit wonky too.

Sound canceling just adds white noise and almost always makes my ears feel like they need to pop when I turn it on. So odd. To the credit of the construction the ear pads are pretty quite when I can get my whole ear into the muffs. I typically use these when driving so playback is not disturbed by ambient road/driving sounds.

I opened the box and tried them on; they seemed pretty comfortable. I plugged them in and left them to charge. The next day, I came home from work, popped them on, and switched the noice cancellation on. I paired them with my iMac, watched a YouTube video, and was happy. Turned them off, and went about my business. A couple of days later, I sat down to do some audio editing. Fired up the headphones, and they immediately connected to my computer. So far, so good.

But then, I heard a little static in the right ear. I moved the switch away from sound-cancelling to bluetooth-only. the static went away. I switched the sound-cancelling back on, and the static returned. I turned the headphones off, disabled my bluetooth, turn the headphones back on, and turned my computer's bluetooth back on. The static was gone. Satisfied, I watched a quick video before getting back to work, and suddenly ear-splitting static assaulted my right side. I yanked the headphones off and held them at arm's length. Overly dramatic? Sure. But I could still hear the static clearly from arm's length away.

To be clear, I didn't have the volume up particularly loud. I have some hearing damage already, and am very protective of what I've got left. The static was loud, painfully so.

[EDIT]
Cowin saw my negative review, and reached out to me very quickly. They gave me a coupon code to try the E7 Pro, ostensibly a better model.

I've tried a few popular budget headphones from Amazon ranging from $15 to $40. What I found is that you either have to compromise on comfort or sound quality in that price range.  I have mpow h2 which has OK sound but gets uncomfortable very quickly so I decided to give this one a try hoping I can get both decent sound quality and comfort.

After reading the review, I had high expectations for this product but ultimately they weren't fully met.

In terms of comfort, it isn't bad. Certainly an upgrade from my mpow h2.

However, as for sound quality, it's quite bare bone. It's not great but also not awful. You cannot adjust the EQ. The default setting definitely has the bass turned up which means it might deliver a good experience for some music but not others. Besides, because of the bass, it doesn't do dialogues very well especially if there's some background noise. For example, I watch a lot of commentary type YouTube videos. The experience certainly is not the best. What's worse is for phone calls or voice messages when there's more noise/interference in the background. The strong bass makes it less intelligible. In my opinion, the mpow h2's sound quality is on par if not better in general and certainly much better in specific use cases because it had multiple EQ presets.

Noise cancelling is also pretty basic in my opinion.

I would put this headphone set in the ""budget"" category. With that said, you can probably find something with comparable performance for less money. But I guess it's not too bad for its price tag anyway.

--- Update 1/12/2019 ---

Added one star for awesome customer service. A representative from Cowin reached out to me and offered an upgrade to resolve my issue. I tried out the E7 pro. I found the performance to be comparable. I just want to reiterate or further elaborate on my original review. E7 and the pro version both have decent performance in terms of music. The one use case I'm less satisfied with is low quality voice messages that have background noise. I suspect that the tuned up bass is somehow making the noise worse and thus rendering the voice messages less intelligible. That said, perhaps it's not a deal-breaker anyway. I believe most people would use this headset for music and movies instead of listening to low fidelity voice messages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The ear cups and noise cancelling allow me to listen comfortably without bowing out my hearing. The connection to my phone was a little finicky with the 3 conductor (stereo) cable that was supplied with the headphones. I bought a better quality 4 conductor (stereo + mic) cable and it works much better. Most of the time I use the Bluetooth connection anyway to avoid pulling the headphones off when I catch the cord.

The Cowin E7 headphones fit the bill and the budget.

I'd rate the sound quality on the E7's as very good. They perform as advertised, with a strong base. I was impressed by the wireless range with Bluetooth, as I could walk into another room without any decrease in perceived audio bit-rate. But Bluetooth has its quirks sometimes, so I'm glad that the headphones come with a regular 1/8 inch stereo jack as a backup if the wireless is having issues.

The affects of the active noise cancelling mode are very much noticeable when toggled on or off. I've never owned a pair of headphones with ANC, and I'm content with how it performs for the E7's. If I were to give these headphones one critique, it's that they leak noise to your surroundings a bit more than I hoped they would.

These were much less expensive than competitors' models, but it did not take long to figure out why. The sound was decent, but the noise-canceling was barely adequate. It made a little difference, but not much, and there was continuous white noise in the background.
Still, they suited my needs well enough for about a year. Then, they began falling apart. First, the padded leather band detached from the metal hinge on one side. Not great, but I figured I could live with it. Today, however, the hinge on the other side broke.
They are now unusable. They did not make it to two years - only about 1 year and 9 months. Naturally, this is just outside of the 18 month warranty.
EDIT: Contacted the company via the email on their website. Though it was out of warranty, they provided a code to repurchase a replacement headset for free again on Amazon. Props to the company (+1 star), but we'll see how long this pair lasts.

Without factoring in build quality, these are decent headphones. The audio quality is merely ""good,"" better than the cheap $25-40 ones, and the noise canceling is ""better than none,"" but leaves behind some white noise.

The noise canceling is not good at all I could hear everything.  But they are comfortable, a little heavy though.  So disappointed based on the other reviews that I read on amazon.

OK this is an update on my review:  The customer service is awesome, I posted my previous review and returned the item and Joey from COWIN emailed me the next day and apologized for the problems.  He sent me a free pair to test and make up for the faulty pair that I received.  This pair was 100x better, the noise canceling is much better, its doesn't completely drowned out the background noise but it takes out most of it.  I can't here conversations around me hardly at all and the white noise that plays in my office is completely gone.  They are really comfortable and soft, I wore them for 18 hrs straight and didn't even feel like I had them on. the sound quality is really good, its not BOSE quality, but way more than I expected for the price point.  The battery life is crazy good, I didn't need charge them for a week and I accidentally left them on all night.  the range is good as well I went all the way to the other end of my office building and they still played.  They cut out when I went into the elevator.  As for using them to take phone calls, well the mic is pretty much like all the other blue tooth headsets, not to great.  People complained and said they couldn't really hear me.  I expected that b/c its the same response I get with all my hands free cell devices. They are very easy to pair and you can pair them with multiple devices.  One other really nice feature is that they also come with a cord to just plug them straight into your phone, ipod, or computer.

Original post
I have previously used Bose QC headphones but my last pair finally died and I've been looking for replacements.  After seeing a pair of these one of my co-workers had purchased, I checked them out on Amazon and read the reviews.  I decided to give them a try, not expecting a lot when comparing the price of these to either Bose or other premium noise cancelling headphones.  Overall, i think the tone is configured more to the bass side than i'd like but they are acceptable.  Having bluetooth is nice and being able to use on phone calls may prove to be valuable but haven't tried that yet.  I haven't flown with them yet and to me, that's the test for NC headphones and my Bose were amazing.  Hoping these do the job but won't know until then.  I like the feel of them and they seem solidly built.  I ordered the hard shell case.  Would be nice if they just raised they price a little and shipped them with the headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I don't like bashing other products so I stay away from super negative reviews unless it's so bad I feel I need to warn other consumers... but I'm ashamed to admit I rarely take the time to praise good products but these are so worth it folks.

Everyday now a soundtrack to your life.","June 21, 2017","I used to have some old Bose headphones with noise canceling. The jack didn't work and figured it was about time for new headphones. I wanted to get wireless because I was tired of fixing the jacks. A quick search and I found the prices outrageous, except for these Cowin headphones.

My ears are irregularly shaped and prone to infection so I wanted over the ears headphones, - not those that you stick in your ear and then they fall out as soon as you move.

My third criteria for purchase was noise-cancelling. I work in a noisy warehouse getting annoyed by the drone of conveyor belts and incessant obnoxious honking of fork-lift drivers.

After purchase, I received a well-put-together box and inside were these beautiful headphones. I turned them on- battery charged and thought it was neat to have R and L notations. They sat comfortably for my small head (which has been a problem with other headphones). I turned on the bluetooth and it connected with my phone. I turned it off and switched on the bluetooth on my computer and it connected just fine as well. It was a bit of a trial and error to turn the volume up and down without skipping back or to the next song.  I walked upstairs and found it was still working just fine, then I went outside and it was still working. I don't know how far it will go, but that was fine for me.

At work, I can move about without wires. I switch the noise-cancelling on and all goes quiet. I'm not an audio person but can now catch noises in songs that I didn't catch before.

Oh, I've had them for about two weeks now. I'm not sure what they run off of, but I use them almost every day and never had a low battery notification. I plugged it in once for about an hour a few days ago because I wasn't sure if it was running off magic or something.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I can honestly say that these Cowin's are the most comfortable headphones I've purchased. I was unsure about purchasing them because I had my eyes set on a pair of Sony headphones for quite a while but I wasn't willing to pay $100 or more so I took a chance on something new.

The sound quality is balanced. The bass isn't overwhelming. The noise cancellation is surprising bonus as I wasn't thinking I would care about it but it really does add to the experience in certain places.

Pros
- Over ear cans are mostly comfortable, but after a while my ears do grow uncomfortable, but nothing unbearable. The material forms a good seal to keep sound out.
- Noise cancellation is adequate. I haven't had much exposure to the technology, but I find it works fairly well. I do notice that the noise cancelling removes a bit of the mid-low end frequency of the music, but I don't find the audio quality, overall, suffers. That said, you're still going to hear stuff going on outside of your little bubble, but the music is able to cut through and nothing gets in the way of that.
- The headphones pair easily. I've had no issues with the bluetooth. You are presented with various tones to indicate the headphones turning on, and also connecting to bluetooth.
- Comes with a backup 1/8"" cable does the trick when necessary
- Audio quality is good. These aren't audiophile headphones, but for the price-range, the sound is quite true. One massive plus is that bass is not overdriven, which I hate about some headphones. I feel the audio is a fair representation. Highs are crisp, lows are full, and that's about it.
- The battery lasts a very long time, and recharges in about a half hour.
- They look good
- Comes with a carry-case which I use more than I expected

Cons/ Only reason for 4 stars, not 5
- I find the volume/skip controls on the headphones un-intuitive and clumsy. I pretty much just set and forget, and do all volume adjustment from my device. Also, volume down is actually the top button, and volume up is the bottom. I'm always doing it wrong. I also despise having to press and hold for the volume. This is true of most bluetooth devices.
- Headphones have three operating positions: Off, On, Noise cancelling. The small switch is just awkward enough to where I always overshoot the On position, which is the middle position. This is a mild complaint.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'm not an audiophile, but I do appreciate clear, precise sound, and these headphones do a good job in that category. I've only tried the noise cancellation in my living room, but it does seem to do the trick. I'll be trying it on an airplane this week, which is my main reason for wanting NC. And speaking of using this on a plane: I asked my husband to check how much sound he could hear while I was playing music with them on, because there's nothing I hate more than an airplane seatmate with a headset that ""leaks"" sound all over the place. My husband had to get right up next to me to hear anything and then, it was not a lot. Battery life seems to be excellent, too.

My only criticism (and I'm hoping to hear from Cowin about this--maybe I have something set wrong), is that I'd like to use the headset for making phone calls. It syncs easily with my phone (Samsung S8), but doesn't allow me to hear my own voice through the speakers. I can only hear my muffled voice coming from my mouth.

I’m excited to have a good quality bluetooth headset that smooths out outside sound to a muffle and have great quality sound and base lines. There is a minor tinny sound to some music but that’s usually the source too. Wearing these isn't embarrassing and I like the look, I like how they wirelessly connect fast and handle handsfree smoothly.  They fold flat by rotating the cups to fit in a backpack or luggage. But why? 30 hour battery life you can wear this on a trip. NYC to Hawaii with 1 full charge. I forget I’m wearing these and they don’t produce much heat or become cumbersome around the ears or pull on my head. The microphone is responsive, but i pull one ear cup off to talk on the phone so i can hear myself so i don’t speak too loud. Walking and listening to music can be dangerous in headphones, these overcome traffic and noise with the onboard microphone(s?) for noise canx. The battery is removable and replaceable.

The bluetooth connection goes approximately 65 feet direct, a little less inside a house because of obstructions. I can charge my phone and listen to music while doing something else in the house or garage.

I don't see why I would buy a $300 wireless, noise canx headset with good connectivity, and construction. when I can value these around 60$ and with Cowin's 18 Month Warranty. seriously. these sound great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Patrick","Terrible microphone, but good noise cancelling in the office.","October 2, 2019","I purchased these primarily to replace on USB headset that failed.

My three criteria for a new set were.
1. Bluetooth so I wasn't tethered.
2. Noise Cancelling to drown out ambient noise
3. A good mic to use for teleconferencing.

# The Good...

Sound Quality: Good,  for the ambient music I listened too at work,  but I'm not an audiophile.

Noise Cancelling in Office: Good. (or maybe just dampening) was really good, but my office isn't that loud. If effectively eliminated the hum of the fluorescent lights, laptop fans, other mild buzzes in my office, and people talking at a low volume near my office door.

Noise Cancelling Plane/Care: Dunno.

Comfort/Fit: I wore these for 6-10 hours a day for about a week. I never felt fatigue or hot.

Range: Awesome. I'm not sure if it is awesome by other BT headphones, but I could get about 60 ft from my desk with multiple walls and a small server room (a single rack about 50% full), before I heard any degradation.

# The Bad...

The microphone: Sucks. In all cases, others on the call told me that I sounded like I was a big room or far away from the mic. Sometimes, I was asked to repeat what I said.

# The Verdict...

If you are just looking for a descent set of OTE Bluetooth headphones and $60 is in the price range, I think you might be happy with them.

Unfortunately, the headset fell short of meeting all three criteria, so back to amazon they go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Do yourself a big favor and purchase the noise canceling phones, the sound is so much better. The bass has a much better sound and the highs come out nicely.

Battery life lasts a long time. I use mine about 2-3 hours a day, and I finally charged them on the eighth day. Bluetooth works seamlessly with my Samsung Note 9. Doesn't bleep out or anything when I exercise. I don't recommend doing situps or pushups since the headphones fall off my head and it's at the tightest function...

I was afraid—because of my huge head—that these wouldn’t work well for me; however, fully extended the headphones fit very comfortably and are so lightweight I hardly notice them. The ear cups for me rest more ON the ear instead of OVER/AROUND the ear, but this could just be because of my big head/ears. Either way, the (faux?) leather is amazingly soft so it’s  not an issue.

Right out of the box I got two and a half days of use (about 10 hrs). After a full charge it lasted more than a week. I did not use them constantly, but rather in “binge” bursts (2-4 hrs at a time, daily).

Only complaint is the aesthetic design: the way the headband is connected to the ear cups, the head band sticks out too much and looks kinda stupid.

I sleep with a very loud white noise machine. On occasion I listen to audio books with this headset on while two feet away from my sleep machine (it's on because my spouse is already asleep.) These effectively block out almost all of the white noise and I am able to clearly hear my book. They are also very comfortable.

These get the job done at 15% of the cost of a high-end solution, making them a great value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Will be testing on several flights over the coming days.

Alright, I came back after leaving a four star review and wanted to drop it to a single star. Used these on a series of flights and they were garbage. The noise cancellling is a joke, just adds an annoying amount of ‘white’ noise. Also during periods of high external voice, these headphones would produce a cracking and popping sound.

These are the first product I have returned on Amazon.

It's for that reason I picked these headphones primarily for the price.  Losing a pair of $60 headphones would not nearly be as painful as losing $250 headphones.  Out of the box they were easy to set up despite an owner's manual with a font definitely not designed for anyone approaching 60.  I tried out the noise cancelling while mowing my lawn and I have to say they work extremely well.  Even without the noise canceling turned on, they fit over my ears so well, noise canceling won't be needed except in extreme circumstances. I also find them very comfortable to wear.
I've pared it with 3 devices so far and I have found that I need to shut off the Bluetooth on the last pared device when I want to pare it with on one of the others.  The headphones want to default to the previous device.  I noticed some reviews really lowered the rating because of paring issues so I wonder if that was their problem too.  But with the other devices off, it connects right away.
The one thing I don't like about them is the instructions say the headphones will not work hard wired using the cable jack, without power.  I can see this being very frustrating if my battery runs out on a long flight.
I'll leave the sound quality reviews to others because sound is so subjective.  I'll leave it at it sounds fine to me, meaning no distortion and good range.  I'm not extremely bass driven when listening to music.  For the price I'm very happy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound quality is very good, and the setup is a cinch; I had no problems connecting/using them with either my MacBook Pro or my iPhone XS Max. The noise cancellation feature, though, is a little bit flimsy--it works moderately well if there is relatively light background noise and whatever you are listening to is fairly robust, but they don't do a great job of dealing with noises that are louder or particularly close to you. Overall, though, I'm pleased with them--I bought them to help me deal with being in a shared office with three other people, and they've done just fine for that purpose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

So, these will work corded or with bluetooth. The fabric is nice and ear pieces are comfortable.  If you have large ears, they may not go completely inside the ear piece (mine fit fine).  I bought another brand for a similar price point about 2 years ago and these sound way better.  I thought it was a bonus feature having the noise cancelling, but if you are getting these because that is a must have feature, I would pass.  To be fair, I have never listened to another set of noise cancelling headphones, but to me, you lose bass and not a lot of noise cancellation.  Honestly, with the sound turned up to only a few bars, you can't hear outside noise anyway, so I don't find that as a huge issue.  Remember, you aren't paying the price for Bose so your expectations can't be Bose like.

The battery also works incredibly. I used the item for 2 weeks without charging and it's still at 70%. I actually left it unused and uncharged for about 3 weeks when I was starting a new job and its battery didnt diminish at all. Very impressive.

The bluetooth is easy to use as well.

While it might not be the all around best sound you can buy, for the money you can't beat it!  The battery life is impressive.  I use the headphones quite a bit and I'll go days without charging it.  The sound is pretty good but the noise canceling isn't all that great but that's not what I use it for.  So after using these headphones for over a year, I'm moving my rating to a 4 star.  Great value but keep in mind it won't be the premium sound that others offer for $200+.  It's a good every day headphone, long battery life and solid sound.  It was a great buy!

I was in the market for some premium headphones and was ready to purchase but then I came across the Cowin E7.  I saw all the 5 star reviews and figured this was some hidden gem on Amazon.  Figured so many people couldn't be wrong.

First, in no way should these headphones be compared to some other premium headphones.  If I didn't know that considerably better headphones existed, I would be quite happy with this purchase.

Material Quality: 7/10
The overall material quality of the Cowin E7 is pretty good.  It is easily adjustable and doesn't slide off your head.  I'm not a big fan of the plastic and the control switches on the ear isn't that great.  That said, it feels like it will last for a long time
Comfort: 8/10
The ear pads are soft and it doesn't hurt after wearing them for a couple of hours.  It doesn't fit perfectly like the Bose QuitetComfort 35 but it is more comfortable than many other headphones I've worn.  Comfort isn't a problem with this device.
Bluetooth: 5/10
I find that the bluetooth isn't that great with the Cowin E7 and my music would often skip and disconnect even with the headphones fully charged.  Since I use the wireless feature all the time, this is a big concern for me.  It might end up being the reason I send it back for a refund.  Pretty disappointed.
Audio Bass: 8/10
This device can bump a little bit so long as it's not in the noise canceling mode.  Good vibrations!
Audio Quality: 4/10
This is just not a good choice if you're looking for clear sounding audio.  Voices sound muffled and drowned out by the bass.  The best way to clearly hear lyrics is to stay in noise canceling mode but that ends up making the music sound different.  Not pleased at all with the audio quality.
Volume: 6/10
It just doesn't get that loud.  If you crank it up to 11, it still won't make you flinch.  If that's what you're looking for then I'd skip this product.
Noise Canceling: 2/10
I mean, it kinda cancels out some noise but you can still hear everything that that's going on around you.  Pretty disappointed about this feature

For $70 bucks, this isn't a bad deal but in no way are you getting a premium headphone.  Temper your expectations as the sound quality will not blow you away.  The noise cancelation option is not going to cut it.  I really don't understand how so many people were impressed with it.  It makes me wonder if I got a defective headphone.

If you can't afford the higher premium headphones then this should work for you.  Just don't expect it to have the same sound","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I’m updating to say that, with the use of zip ties after one of the can holders broke, I can still use them but I don’t. I upgraded to Jabra Elites. The other pair of these headphones that we bought aren’t functional anymore.

However I am also lowering my star rating because I have been receiving way too many (like twice a month) texts, calls, and emails from the company asking me to change my rating in exchange for another pair of headphones.

At first, I was fine ignoring the messages because I had moved on to the Jabras and didn’t have the time or need to devote to the problem. However, I am now sick of being contacted. If I ignored the first few messages, it is safe to say I am not interested. There is no need for the company to continue to contact me. They should have taken the measly hit that my original 3 star review was and moved on.

I don’t like how companies are gaming Amazon to take money for garbage products. Maybe this company is just a victim of all the other companies that are trying to take advantage and maybe I just happened to get 2 inferior sets of headphones when they are usually great? I don’t know and I don’t care. What I do care about is companies using fake reviews to increase sales and take money from average consumers.

So, Buyer Beware.

Original Review:

I’ve had this for about 2 months. The noise cancelling feature stopped working about a week ago. It sounds like a short even though I really pamper my headphones. The headphones are comfortable and the battery life is fantastic.
I will keep using these until they die because they do work well, unless you need noise cancelling.

The red is beautiful and bright. The buttons are a little weird and fiddly. And, the on/off/bt ink wore off very quickly. But, that’s just a minor annoyance. I expected better for $70 but they are okay. I wouldn’t say don’t buy them but I won’t buy them again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I also think the protein (ear)pads are incredibly comfortable, even after long periods of listening.  And after having a problem with my headphones and being used to terrible to no customer support from companies, it was a relief to work with COWIN who offered to ship me out a replacement in a breeze.  They/COWIN stand by their warranty/warranties, especially if you (have) register(ed) your product.  But even if you didn't, they will help you out as long as you have proof of purchase and a problem and are within the warranty timeframe.  Really great headphones by a really great company.

PS: IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE COWIN E8 INSTEAD.  E7=Great Value Bluetooth Bass-knocking Headphones. E8=One Word, MASTERPIECE. [Totally worth the increased cost, but either product is good.  I own both. I thought the E7 were amazing, until I was introduced to the E8 (especially with the improvements in noise cancelation, both passive and active), and then... my mind was blown.  Big Fan.

In the end, these ones had excellent reviews and comments and I must agree with them.  Perhaps the only bone I have to pick is that the battery lasts for so long the warning tone about it being low caught me by surprise.  I also noted that the sign to indicate that it's full is that the red light on the headphone stops blinking.  Now, I must say that I prefer to listen to music with this headphones and my iPod, but TV shows and movies have a very decent sound too, just not as good as the old Bose headphones I have.  I must say that I'm very pleased with the built quality, comfort and sound (bass especially), and I can recommend them without reservation.
EDIT:  A year after purchase, these headphones still work as well as the first day.  Even though I don't use the noise cancellation feature very often, I can say it works very well in combination with listening to music (tried during a transatlantic flight).  I am wearing them in a car (not driving), once a week, connected to my iPod, and they're comfortable beyond belief.  I like the fact that, if needed, I can turn them on or off in the dark, because the switch is very easy to locate with one's fingertips.

I haven't yet had the opportunity to use it on a plane, but it works great to drown out the HVAC, loud coworkers on speakerphone and the lawnmower with noise cancelling on. They're excellent for gaming parties, with the noise cancelling off, and I have the freedom of movement without a cable tethering me to the tower.

The earmuffs do get warm when wearing them for an extended period or being active, like mowing the lawn or playing in VR. The noise cancelling does drop the bass down a little to compensate for surrounding noise. I almost returned them because the audio seems to cut out when I move abruptly, but it only happens with noise cancelling enabled, and my ear lobe seems to hit the driver. I think my big ears may interfere with the cancelling technology when I'm active.

They otherwise sound great, and I've had no real problems with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sound quality is fantastic for its price, bass is good, the only other thing besides Bluetooth that isn't necessarily that bad, but could improve is noise cancelation. It's not really as great as it's made out to be, but there's definitely still some noise cancelation.

Now when it comes to Bluetooth, if you're looking for headphones solely for Bluetooth, do not get this. It uses older Bluetooth technology and is only good for audio. If you try to watch videos with these headphones, there will be some serious lag. Just use the aux cord.

That brings me to one more thing I almost forgot to mention. The aux cord that came with my headphones were garbage for some reason. And they were too short. So I bought a standard $3-$5 Amazon Basics aux cord that was longer and it worked flawlessly. So you might have to do that too, since the one that comes in the box wasn't good in my experience.

So yeah, overall, great set of headphones, I definitely do not regret buying these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Pros: Active noise cancelling to tone down office chatter? Amazing! Bluetooth? Excellent! Build quality is excellent.  Construction is mostly plastic, but they added a nice springy piece of stainless to strengthen the band.  Also, the plastic feels solid and does not creak. Design looks nice. Battery has lasted several full days at work without needing a charge, which is exactly the sort of thing I have come to expect from the OEM behind Cowin.

Cons: the 3.5mm cord could be a little longer. The usb cable, used for charging, could stand to be twice as long, but who doesn't have a dozen of those sitting around already?  The 3.5mm jack could be a little more rigid.  It flexes when the plug is rotated and crackles a little. These negatives are not relevant when used in bluetooth mode and both of these are nitpicking, not a real complaint.

Other notes: Even the packaging was nice, though I feel the foam insert in the box could use a little work.  Also, note that the headphones must be powered on even when using a cord.  I had to give these things a five star rating because they really do hit all the right marks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was trying to watch a movie on my tablet using plain ol' ear buds, and I could not hear a thing over the noise of the airplane engine. I had to resort to watching a foreign movie with subtitles so I could at least read the dialogue. I did a bunch of research  and ultimately chose these. They were definitely the right price and had good ratings. I've been using them for a few months now, and I love them. They fit all of my needs. They are well-priced, they fit comfortably over my ears for hours, they sync easily with my all of the devices I've tried to sync it with, and the sound is fantastic. I have worn them in high-noise situations, and I was surprised at how well they work to block out ambient noise.  They even have handy controls right on them, so I can easily adjust the volume. I don't use them all the time, but when I do use them, it's for hours at a time and I have never had an issue with the batteries. I did get the corresponding COWIN case for them, as the drawstring bag these come with is laughable to protect them, and I'm glad I did.

The bass is a bit boomy at times without breaking up, but not boomy to the point of distraction. Subtle music volume variations are smooth and, thanks to good ear cushion design, nothing is lost. Comfort is outstanding. Noise cancellation is not one of its strong points, as described in other reviews. In one respect the volume button design is the opposite of intuitive, with the volume decrease function physically located above the volume increase function on the right ear panel. It is a dual function button, combining volume with track advance/repeat, a nice way to eliminate touch control confusion.  Bluetooth pairing with my desktop computer is consistently reliable and automatic after the first time, but walking around the room or to another room causes signal breakup. Moving around while seated at my desk is no problem for signal continuity. Overall, the COWIN E7 is a well priced headphone that should please most users in the under $100 price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I bought these things hoping to cut the noise a bit but because of the price I didn't expect much.
WAS I WRONG !! :)
I love this headset.  I bought them in March of 2019 & have used them 2000 hours (according to Pandora) with ZERO problems !!!
They have always automatically paired to my Samsung S8 and I do not have to listen to my ears ring for 2 hours after getting off the tractor for the day.  The battery is strong too, I usually charge them every night after work but have forgotten a couple of times and they lasted 2 work days (22 hours) on one charge no problem.
I have used them with the noise cancellation only (no music) & they are just as fantastic.
I will not say that these are the best headset for the money, as far as I'm concerned they are the best headset I have ever used and (don't tell the seller but if I had known I would paid more for them - they are THAT GOOD :)

Disclaimer: I was given an updated version of the headphones to try out and these are my honest opinions:
*old headphones had a clicking problem that the new ones do not
*the microphone in the new one has been improved greatly, with the old ones, i tried to hold a conversation at a busy airport and the person on the other end could not hear me at oll, with the new ones, I was able to hold a full conversation in a busy coffee shop without any issue
*they also fixed the issue with the noise cancelling not being available with the auxiliary so now, you can listen to the music with noise cancelling while the headphones are plugged, this is extremely convenient on the airplane as these are compatible with the head-back screen on long haul flights

Overall, the new headphones are greatly improved compared to the old ones and very much worth the price you pay for it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's not a bad pair of noise cancelling headphones for the price. A quick disclaimer for people looking to buy noise cancelling headphones, it is not designed to completely block out noise so it will not entirely block out conversation and such.
Pros:
*it connects pretty easily to bluetooth
*it cancels out jet engine noise and other low frequency noise to a reasonable level
*it covers my ear without causing any discomfort
*battery life has not given me any issues. The battery seems to hold charge fairly well, I used it sporadically over a two week period and I have not had to charge it at all but I will turn it off between use

Cons:
*sometimes there is a clicking noise when the noise cancelling feature is on
*when the headphones are plugged into the auxiliary, the noise cancelling feature is no longer available
*the plastic covering picks up fingerprints very easily","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Since making this review in 2018, Cowin has continuously harassed me and attempted to bribe me into changing my review. I consider these practices totally unethical and have seen no improvement from my attempts to report these seller terms violations to Amazon and have no way to request that Cowin stop abusing their access to my personal email address. The seller terms only allow the use of Amazon customer email addresses to communicate information about a purchase. No company should be emailing customers three years after the completion of a purchase, especially not in response to a slightly critical review. I consider that to be harassment.

Furthermore, if you will notice, many of the five star reviews here state that after initially finding the product defective, they were offered a refund and free ""upgrade"" by Cowin and now they have changed their review in response. This is not ""good customer service."" This is bribery, plain and simple, and it is in violation of Amazon's seller terms. Amazon's reviews have lost all legitimacy due to this now common practice. See quoted text below for an example of the emails Cowin has been sending to me since 2018 (it is now July 2019).

"" I understand the review was from a while ago, if you may please kindly give me a chance to resolve, I can offer you a replacement, an upgrade to another model at no cost to you or a refund on your purchase. Anything is negotiable.

Personally, I am from the customer relations department. My goal is to ensure buyers are satisfied with our product and service. We offer 18 Months Warranty on our products.

If you would like to accept my offer please kindly contact me at (phone number). In hopes to earn a review deletion or revision from you.""

Original Review:
First off, my head is on the smaller side (I am a woman). These did not fit snug to my ears. They are really loose, flimsy and floppy. Second, the noise cancelling simply does not work. It is almost certainly exacerbated by the poor fit, but I've had several pair of noise cancelling headphones that were cheaper than these and were better at noise cancelling. Third, even with the aux cable plugged in, the sound cuts out if I slightly move my head. Since I wanted these to wear while riding around on the tractor and working outside, that is really not going to work, so I am sending them back.

The packaging and presentation are great. I just wish the headphones were up to that same quality.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Pros: good headset, good sound quality, good noise cancellation.

Cons: Bluetooth stopped working on second week. Not I have to use a cable in order to play music.

It sort of recessed into the unit and we were unable to turn the unit off or use it.

And the battery...AMAZING!","April 30, 2019","I loved the price and the different colors; blue is my favorite color, so it was nice to get headphones in blue. The earpieces are soft, very comfortable and fit around my ears perfectly like they were sized to my ears (I have small ears FYI). The set-up and button controls are very easy and the sound quality is excellent; I have heard tones/sounds and words in songs that I hadn't heard before, SERIOUSLY and I'm talking about in some songs that are 15, 20 years old that I've heard hundreds if not thousands of times. The sound doesn't get garbled or scratchy sounding when you increase the volume; in fact, I turned it to the max just to see and still GREAT sound! The active noise canceling is great; it does not cut out 100% of voices, but 98-99% is good enough for me...the noise canceling is so good that wearing them while I type, I literally can barely hear myself typing, and it may be more of a ""I see myself typing thing so I hear it a little bit'""! They paired easily with my phone and laptop, the controls are on the right side and again are very easy to learn/remember. After researching active vs. passive, white noise, wired vs wireless, etc., I actually made the final decision as these were listed on a website in the top 5 best noise canceling headphones for students, which was my need for them, to study in peace; the ability to listen to music is a bonus. BUT, here's the BEST part; that battery that they advertise that lasts 30 hours that I'm sure many people don't believe, BELIEVE IT, BELIEVE ME! They say to charge it for 8 hours when you first get it, but it's already mostly charged and I think it took an hour if that to reach full charge. I opened and charged it when I got it on 4/22; I have used these headphones all but on 3 days since each time for a minimum of 8 hours, most days it was about 10 and the longest time was for about 12 hours on a single occasion (it is 4/30 as I write this review); the battery indicator that appears on my phone when playing music is still completely FULL! So I have gotten more than 30 hours of use out of them and the battery indicator has not moved; I am truly amazed and more than satisfied! Bonuses: the carrying bag, wire to connect to your laptop and ""VIP"" card for you to register online which gives you an additional 6 months to your warranty.

They replaced an older set of Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 phones, and there really is no comparison (note - I have no idea if the newer Audio Technica headphones are better than the ones I own).  The Cowin’s are much more comfortable, and the noise reduction is far better.

I bought the original AR's for long haul airplane travel.  They were only OK, with noticeable background noise.  They were also too tight on my head, even with bending the headband, and the ear pieces were shaped such that they pressed on my ears, creating pain after a while.

What a joy to use these Cowin's.  Yes, the ear pieces are big... they don't squash my ears, and as an added benefit, as a behind the ear hearing aid wearer, I got no feedback when wearing these headphones.  I used them on a 17 hour flight to Asia and they worked very well... virtually no cabin noise entered my world but with the microphone, I could still understand when people spoke to me.

They are comfortable enough to wear 6 or 7 hours at a time.  Battery life is very good.  Noise cancellation works with Bluetooth, or with supplied hard wire, required for most airline movie setups.

I'm now using them in my Mazda Tribute... a decent but rather noisy vehicle with engine and road noise.  These headphones give me a quite ride such that I can listen to music at low volume.  And again, the microphone means I can hear necessary outside sounds, a horn, people speaking to me, even the ""tic tic"" of my turn signal... but the low level rumble is gone.

All in all, worth a five star rating, especially given the price.  Yes, they are large, and that is one of the benefits.  Just wish Cowin would answer questions on their website... never did get an answer about the differences between old and new model... I have the old... quite satisfied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Arce","Great headphones","March 13, 2017","Not very comfortable to me. But I have a big head. These aren't ""real"" noise cancelling headphones. I guess you have to pay 2-3 hundred for those. The only way to really cancel out any sound is to turn up the volume. The battery life is great and the distance you can use these away from your device is amazing. Sound quality isn't bad, either. Overall, nice headphones.

Update August 2017
I have been using these at work a lot lately. Due to some equipment issues, the machines are super loud and we are required to wear ear plugs unless you want to go deaf. I stuck to these headphones. I can tell the difference now, between noise cancellation off/on. They are great. However, my head is still too big for these headphones. I can wear them for about two hours max. I haven't tried to bend the frame but I would rather not break them. Although they fit me tight, they tend to fall off when I look down.
The Bluetooth radio distance is OUTSTANDING!!! From my office, to the production floor, about 250 feet, and no static or interruption of music. There are a few computers, wifi routers scattered in our building, a window and 3 big machines in between and still no issue. I finally lose connection when I enter another department.
 At home, things were a bit different. Last week when I was cutting the grass, I decided to wear these. I couldn't go 20 feet from my phone that was charging inside my house. I sat it against the window, but still, too much static and interference. I'm wondering if it had anything to do with being outdoors.
Great battery life. They have never died, not even a warning that the battery is low. However, I do not use them everyday. I got these in February and have only charged it 3 or 4 times.
I recommend them but I think they are a bit pricy for what you get.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They connect easily enough to your device. I had some trouble with connecting to a laptop, when they were already connected to my phone. I'm not sure if this is user error or they can't connect to two devices at once. My big issue with these is that though they have wired capabilities, you can't use them with the wire if the battery has run out. This makes zero sense since I thought the whole point of being able to connect with a wire was an alternative to the Bluetooth, should the battery get too low. Very annoying. They do hold a charge well though so as long as you stay on top of that you won't have a problem, I suppose. The over-the-ear design and the volume control work well enough to where I don't use the noise canceling feature. From other reviews, it seems that aspect works well, if that's important to you.

Gave it three stars because of the wired issue. They're good headphones for the price-point, but there's probably better ones out there that cost about the same.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sanders","Poor quality construction","December 21, 2018","After seeing all the high reviews for these headphones, I purchased them with the expectation that they were going to be amazing, I came to the realization that those reviews were not accurate. I’m of the belief that those high reviews were left after the initial use of the headphones.
Construction quality - They feel flimsy at best. The earphones are comfortable but the unit tends to slide off of ones head and doesn’t stay in place. After using them for a few months one of the earphones broke away from the unit and is only hanging by a wire. For the life of me I can’t figure out how it happened or how it was even staying in place.
Active Noise Cancelling -  this worked great at first and after a while they had problems with periodically make a high pitched noise. The only remedy to this noise would be to turn off the active noise cancellation. When the active noise cancellation is in use another noise would emanate on the track is skipped or the music is stopped/started. In other words, don’t touch the headphones when the active noise cancellation is in use.
Battery life - Amazing! I could use them for over a week on a single charge.
Sound Quality - The loudness is good, the lows are muffled and the bass in certain music makes it sound as if the drivers aren’t able to reproduce the frequency accurately.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I went through several brands finding one that paired with my Fire tablet and my android phone and was comfortable on my head and ears.  I have a head on the smaller side and the area around my ears is very sensitive to touch.  These headphones are lightweight, the soft padding of the ears make them comfortable, and the size is easy to adjust to my head.  I have each side only one adjustment up from as small as they get so adults don't have to worry about them fitting.

I would give 5 stars except for 3 reasons.
1) they are not foldable so take up extra room in bags when traveling.
2) the print on the headphones and instructions is about as small as it can get.  I have a new reading prescription and struggled just to make out the on and off.  Maybe if the print was a different color.
3) they charge quite a bit more for colors other than black.  Not fair to those of us who prefer color in our accessories and the corset are easier to find.

I don't work and am often home and my husband works from home.  We enjoy different genres of music and these allow me to get things done around the house listening to music which makes everything more enjoyable.

I am guessing that the noise cancellation works well as he has had to tap me on the shoulder a couple of times.  But, you can still hear some noise  - which is helpful when cooking.

I am not a person who is picky about bass, treble, and those things but I will say the sound makes me feel like I am in a room with good speakers all around me.

I am still figuring out the volume (sounds dumb but I am doing something that makes it advance to the next song) and I don't use it with my phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Nye","Stylish with good sound for low cost","July 28, 2017","I bought these headphones on a Gold Box offer for just under $40. I have been wanting some wireless headphones to use with my Amazon Echo but did not want to spend a couple of hundred dollars for something I would only use occasionally. These headphones turned out to be perfect for that purpose.

The headphones arrive very nicely packaged in a black box surrounded in plastic wrap. Included with the headphones are a USB charging cable, a 1/8 inch stereo cable for wired connection to an audio source, and a soft storage bag. A brief printed user manual is also provided. No AC/USB adapter is provided, so you will either need to purchase one separately or use a computer USB port to charge the battery.

The headphones are designed to swivel flat for easy storage. They are surprisingly lightweight for their size. The padding on the ear cups is soft, and they are comfortable to wear. The plastic housing is shiny but gets smudged with fingerprints easily.

I had no difficulty pairing the headphones with my Echo following the instructions in the manual. Adjustments for volume, song selection, and call answering (if paired with a phone) are easily made with a multi-function switch on the ear cup.

Using the headphones wirelessly with my Echo I found the music sound to have reasonably deep bass and rich tone. Midrange and high tones are somewhat muted, but the sound was still pretty good for such an inexpensive pair of headphones. They also do a nice job of suppressing noise. The Bluetooth range is impressive, and I can walk all over the ground floor of my home while listening to music.  I did not test the microphone function for these headphones, so if that is an important feature for you it will be necessary to assess that from another reviewer.

If you are looking for inexpensive wireless headphones with active noise cancelling these Cowin E-7 headphones are well worth consideration. They look and feel good and provide pretty good sound for their relatively low cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

We purchased two of the headphones to take on a trip with long plane rides.  Ironically, we were seated by the wings/engine of the plane each flight.  The noise cancelling function on the headphones works amazingly well.  Granted, they are not Bose, but they are definitely worth more then their price tag.  I am not an audiophile,  but I am a musician and have very high standards for sound reproduction in headphones.  These are in the very good range of headphones.  (This coming from a normal Bose listener).  I have been happy with the sound, style, comfort, noise cancelling option, ease of connection through Bluetooth, and the extraordinary battery life.

So I will say first a couple of things about the very expensive Bose earphones and then give you my experience with the COWIN E7.

It is easy to experience the Bose product by just walking in a best buy store where they have the Bose ready to sample as sound quality and noise canceling functionality. When I put on the Bose in the store, there was fairly loud music playing from the overhead speakers and amazingly the noise canceling function of the Bose made the overhead music magically disappear almost entirely and you really had to pay attention to listen to it. Also very important to note that although the Bose earphones are over-ear they feel more like on-ear and very, very comfortable.

Having said all that, I purchased the COWIN E7 earphones and at first I was impressed for the price point but I have to say that the noise cancelling feature of the earphones is not even close to satisfactory. First of all, they will only cancel constant steady noise like the sound of an airplane's engine but will not cancel the sound of a lawn mower engine to a large degree. The truth is that these earphones are relying more on the over-ear feature than the noise canceling circuitry. When you first put them on, you realize that they act like noise reduction earmuffs because even when they are turned off they reduce sounds by a lot. The disappointment comes when you turn them on and you realize that the noise canceling function adds very little to the sound reduction that already occurred when you placed them on your ears. During the flight, they proved fairly useless when a child would start to cry and that is something to be expected multiple times on a long flight. While I am writing this review, I have a fan on the window and I put them on to see if they are effective with the fan noise. The canceling circuitry adds to the reduction but the fan noise is largely gone just by putting them on.

Battery life is great and I used them for many hours without worrying about charging them but the triangle style buttons arrangement (see attached image) is disorienting and you will find yourself going to the next song or chapter of your audio book while you were simply trying to pause the playlist. The sound is nowhere near the quality of the Bose but acceptable nonetheless. The comfort is simply not there, they are a little bulky, a little heavy and in my case, they irritated my ears a little after a couple of hours. I am not a stranger to earmuffs, earpieces and earphones and I wear a Plantronics earpiece about 10 hours a day. You know that your earphones bother you if the thought of them being there keeps coming to mind and I am sure that you will not forget that you have these on.

In my opinion, If you are looking for Bluetooth earphones that are not too expensive and have acceptable sound quality, these may be a good buy. You should look at the noise canceling feature as an added bonus that may come a little handy in an airplane but nothing more. If you can spare the $350.00 for the Bose, there is no doubt that you will regret buying these and end up getting the Bose too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I went ahead because I was impressed by the seller's responses to those who complained. My experience has been nothing short of stellar so far.

They connect to my iPhone instantly. No BT issues at all, in fact, these headphones are the only BT devices I have never had any issue with. The show up as ""E7"" the first time you connect which is so much better than the usual ""12#45& jioI6"" or whatever that you can't relate to.

I have high frequency loss so I am not the best judge of high fidelity or frequency response, I can tell you that these reproduce better than any of the 5 in the ear devices I have used in the past two years. That includes a 250.00 pair of BOSE earbuds. I'll have to leave it at that.

They are very comfortable on me and do not crush my ears or cause fatigue. When the weather is warm, they also get warm. But that is true with any non-sport over the ear headphones. These are large, they are not ""sport"" or light. They are light for a set their size but they are not going to work well for running or sweaty walks. They are great for the plane, train, working at your desk.

The active noise cancellation is noticeable but certainly not complete. It certainly gets rid of the hollow echo sound from external sources so you can concentrate on the music. It does that very well. But it is not a 300.00 Bose multichannel active noise cancellation. It is just basic and for that it works  very well.

The fantastic thing about these is that it holds a charge forever. The manual says 30 hours...I've never waited that long but the battery indication it feeds to your device always shows a healthy charge. I charge it up every three days or so and I used it every day at work and on my 1 hour train ride each way. Also, the battery is easily removable and replaceable off the shelf. How cool is that? ( as opposed to a built in lithium battery).

I've used the mic on phone calls and get good reports, but I have never used it outside or in a very noisy environment, so I cannot report on that.

It comes with a mini usb charger and a mini plug for plugging it into a mini headphone jack instead of using BT. That means you can use it with a dead battery if you have a headphone jack. Very thoughtful design especially in this price range. A real winner. The storage bag  is very good and not cheap and the headphones turn sideways to flatten out so they fit will in your back pack.

I would have given 5 stars but I feel that if you advertise as noise cancelling, then that function should be a bit better than what is offered here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

My complaints are minor.  The on off switch is fiddly.  I don't like it's location, or function, as it has two different modes, and the one most will use (bluetooth) is in the MIDDLE of a very tiny three way switch.  I'm always switching it past what I want, and having to correct.  I don't like that.

I do like that the power light is on only one side of the headphones.  This makes it super easy to know which way to put them on.  It also has very clear R and L indicators on the inside of the hinges, further helping.

The sound was alright, though you can't walk with the sound canceling activated - it cuts in and out of the music.

By November, both earphones had popped out of their rotation socket. Both happened as I was putting the headphones on, first the right ear than the next week the left ear popped out. Currently it's held together by tape which I have to reapply every few hours. I am incredibly disappointed with the product. I use these headphones solely at my desk and still, they fell apart. Literally.

I tried to reach out to TradeSquare, but because the company, Cowin, offers a one year warranty, I was told I needed to contact Cowin. The only problem? They don't respond. I've reached out to Cowin numerous times, received an automatic response asking for photos and my receipt, of which I provided both. Then, radio silence. I don't know what else to do to get these replaced or fixed, as Cowin won't reach out. They haven't posted on social media since Spring 2017, so I couldn't reach them there either.

I almost got the Bose Over the Ear Bluetooth at Costco and when I decided to shell out the $99 (after instant rebate), they were all sold out.  I was very impressed by the Bose and started looking for something comparable.

I also checked out the different Bluetooth over the ear headsets at Best Buy and tested their various JBL offerings.  You definitely become aware of the different price points when you put on those JBLs.  The cheapest hurt my head and about the same price as the Cowin and the most expensive, sounded a little better than the cheapest, but felt better.

The Cowin, I'll be honest when I first opened it, felt flimsy, light and honestly cheap.  When I put it on, I was impressed with how it felt.  Now I'm curious on its noise cancelling feature and sound quality.  I'll be right up front... I should have got the $99 Bose Bluetooth at Costco.. kicking my self of not getting that great deal.  The Cowin, definitely not at the same level, not even close.  For $59, I was definitely not expecting it to be a home run, but I'm not disappointed either, especially since I only spent $59.

I let the unit charge fully first... wait until the red charge light goes out, that is when you know its fully charged.
I connected it to my Samsung QLED 82 inch.  I have hardwood floors throughout the house, and my wife was in the kitchen.  Maybe about 28 feet away from where I was sitting.  I was watching Kubo and the Two Strings.
I noticed a slight difference with the noise canceling feature... with the noise canceling off, it sounds like what you would hear when you put your ear to a large sea shell... and when you turn on the noise canceling feature, the sound goes silent.... kinda neat.  But you can still hear things around you, but no ambient noise.  My wife had the bread maker going, and I could hear the motor turning the dough, but it wasn't that noticable, but I could decern the sound if I really paid attention.  The sound from the Cowin, is ok, I wish I could have turned up the volume higher.  I turned the speaker volume on the TV higher and it increased the sound of the Cowin, but I wasn't immersed in sound.  I would have like more richer and louder sound (a personal preference).  The JBL over the ear bluetooth headsets sounded better, but were not as comfortable.

The Cowin bluetooh over the ear headset is very comfortable around the ears, the crown of the head, it can start to feel a little pressure, but not unbearable.  If you have a full set of hair, unlike me, you might not notice that at all.

Overall... for $59, I'm impressed and it works.  I'll keep this until the $99 Bose deal comes around again at Costco.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Best of all, I did not get one of those ""headaches"" that often come with wearing a set of headphones too long.

The only downside of these headphones was the soft bag case that they came in; because the headphones are a little bulky, they did not fit well inside the soft bag case, and there was not a pocket or some other way to separate the cord from the headphones within the bag; you just have to shove everything into the bag and pull the drawstring in order to try to shut it, though the bulk of the headphones, no matter which way I tried to put them in, prevented the bag from being closed all the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

ONLY two stars because the first pair I received, I charged them up and turned on the Noise Cancellation (NC) mode, it was beautifully silent until I moved my head - and then I got bursts of white noise in my right headphone.

So, I'm returning these, giving it one more go - again, they are comfortable, and seem to work well, and are inexpensive enough that I wouldn't mind wearing them out in my garden or travelling with them.

(Also, when I opened the box I thought it looked like the pair I received might not have been new (there were odd smudges on the hard plastic parts of the headphones) but I had wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.)

UPDATE May 15, 2018: Second pair received, unfortunately these were non-functional as well.  Worse than the first pair. The static/white noise was present in both headphone speakers, not just the right - usually upon movement or any sort of touch or pressure. Sounded like there was a wire loose in both headphones.

I am sad, because the material is comfy and the unit is light, but the quality control for this run of headphones was just sorely lacking. I MIGHT be willing to give them one more shot because affordable comfort matters, but for now my review stands at 2 stars.

Also, the customer service/returns process has been painless and pleasant. I'm pulling for this company to get their QA together.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sound quality is okay.  Bluetooth reception distance is good.  I can go from the living room to the kitchen without loosing connection.  about 20 feet or so with a wall in between.

I purchased these headphones to:
1. Block out the construction noise right outside my window...
2. Replace my current, well used, bluetooth headphones

Pros:
* Comfortable on my ears
* Blocked about 95% of the construction noise, other people's conversations on the busses, and general unwated noise pollution
* Amazing battery life!! Literally used it from 7:30am - 8:00pm because... noise.
* Sound quality: Since I'm not particularly and audiophile, I wasn't looking to hear everything but for me the quality was fantastic! Because I did end up hearing everything of whatever I was playing (from music to podcasts).

Cons:
* Loose speakers (or something) in the headphones, making a rattling sound at the slightest movement. That could range from going over a tiny TINY bump on the road, to my every single step. Since I walk about 2 miles every day, that's a lot of rattling.
* Horrible mic. Over the past 3 weeks I tested the mic in my office, walking to/from my office, at home, on the bus, in the city, and out in the country. No matter where I was, the time of day, or the weather (clear sunny sky, or pouring rain), I couldn't be heard.
* Aux cable doesn't include separate mic

Why did I wait so long? 1. The noise pollution outside of my window drove me insane. It's calmed down quite a bit so the URGENT need for these is gone. However, I will be ordering a different pair ASAP. 2. I wanted to see if I could just live with the mic being terrible and the rattling noises in the headphones. Note, these two cons were an issue from the get go but because I desperately needed to cancel the noise from right outside of my window, I decided to bare with it. Now that it's somewhat bareable, these issues have become annoying.

I would recommend this product if you don't intend to use the mic and if you just sit still with the headphones. It's possible I got a lemon, but those were my issues and because of the fact that the Aux cable doesn't have a mic (and come to think of it the headphones don't have phone controls), it doesn't really suit all of my needs. Again, this was a desprate purchase so I'd have probably passed on them if I read the description better. I liked the sound quality, though, so I'll be going through their products to see if they have something that checks off all of what I need!

****EDIT****

So, I didn't realize that Cowin had responded to my review until literally today. However, they did send me a replacement headset in like 2 days which was AMAZING!! For that alone, this gets one more star. With the set they sent me, the rattling is barely there and it does take a rickety bus to make them move around in the earpieces. Unfortunately, the mic is still poor in quality. I've asked several people, in several locations how I sounded and each said I sounded muddy at my normal speaking level. In order to be heard somewhat clearly, I have to yell which doesn't necessarily work when you're in a crowded place, and worse, when in transit. Still, I love the sound and have actually seen a number of people walking around with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

First, the microphone never worked on phone calls for me. No one could hear me at all. Second, and this is why they are useless to me now, I had them paired to a linux machine and they worked nicely. When I disconnected them from bluetooth the blue light stopped blinking and now it is just a solid white light. They no longer work, even while plugged in with the 3.5mm cable. I havn't found a way to reset them. As other reviews have said, there is no way to remove the battery and even if I could I'm not sure it would reset them. After being very pleased, I am now very disappointed.

UPDATE**  I fixed the BT connection problem by removing the screw (Very small torx) from the side with the power switch and the cover came off. Then I lifted the black tab holding the small ribbon in place and gently pulled the ribbon out. This effectively disconnected the battery from the circuit board. I waited a minute and plugged the cable back in and reset the black tab. The headphones fired up and acted normal. Hopefully this will help some of you. Unfortunately this didn't fix my microphone issue.

UPDATE (2): I was contacted by customer service and offered a replacement pair. Unfortunately they will not be in stock until the end of January. They will ship them to me then. They also refunded me 50% of the purchase price. Because of the EXCELLENT customer service I am upgrading my rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've been in the market for headphones to replace my first gen. Beats by Dre that I used primarily for commuting to and from work.  The E7 is packaged nicely and it paired extremely fast with the NFC feature.  They are not heavy at all, but do not feel flimsy.  The ear cushions, which are made of ""protein""? (an animal that's not a cow I assume) are very cushy.  Also the headband is made with a very cushy material.  They feel great on the head and on the ears.  Although I have not worn these for more than an hour at a time, it felt as if I could wear them all day without any problems.  The swivel ear pieces make it easy to wear around your neck when you're taking a break.

Battery life is great.  I've had these a week and I have not had to charge them yet.  The material is hard plastic.  I thought that maybe the chrome portions of the headphones would be metal, but they are not.  That being said, although they seem to be well built and sturdy, I would not recommend these for kids, someone who is accident prone or an extremely active person.

The sound quality is decent.  They don't blow you out the water with sound, but for the price, I was pleasantly surprised.  For some reason, the music seems to sound better using noise cancellation.  Otherwise, I get a hollow sound.  I also noticed that, after downloading an after-market equalizer for my phone and customizing the settings, It increased the sound quality immensely.  The controls on the earpiece take a bit getting used to.  I would have liked for the volume up to be on top and volume down to be on the bottom.  Also, I haven't gotten any connection issues that are common with inexpensive bluetooth headphones.  I believe these are bluetooth 4.0, which isn't bad.  They come with a usb to micro usb cable as well as a 3.5mm audio jack cable that enables you to charge your headphones while listening.  Also included is a synthetic travel bag for the headphones.  I would recommend getting a hard case if you're going to travel/pack these.

Overall, I really like these and recommend these for anyone looking for decent sounding, comfortable and inexpensive blue tooth headphones.  I would say these give other better known brand, $100+  headphones a run for their money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I’ve been using them for about a week or so (I will update this once more time passes) but so far I’m loving them. I have issues finding headphones to fit my head size, but these were perfect. I can wear them for hours with nothing but comfort, even while wearing glasses.

The ear pads are super soft, as well as the padding around the headband. The controls were a little hard to get used to, only because I’m used to my Apple earbuds and pressing the next/pause/play button on the cord, but it was pretty easy to switch to the button on the side of the headphones instead.

I love how it automatically pairs with my phone when I turn it on in close proximity to it. The sound quality is crisp, and has a good bass. You really don’t need to have the volume that loud to get the best of music either, which is nice bc I’m at big fault for having my volume too loud all the time.

I only had the battery die once, and that was because I wasn’t paying attention and using them all day. It’s super nice to see a battery level when it’s connected to my phone, I haven’t seen a battery gauge on my other devices but it’s not a big deal, it’s probably just the device I’m connecting to.

It comes with a faux leather looking drawstring bag with the logo embossed on the front. One charger, and one male/male aux cord. As well as instructions about and care knowledge.

Overall I’m highly satisfied with my purchase, and will be buying from this company again.

I have electronic headphones that I use while shooting.  They are not truly noise cancelling but they do cancel out much of the noise of a gunshot.  However I very seldom turn them on as I find background conversations annoying and distracting.
I do hope to use these to watch television but only one of my sets has a Bluetooth soundbar so I may be TV shopping before I can really give these a try.
If they do work out I'll probably buy  a pair for my wife as we both have trouble following some of the conversations , especially some of the English series.  Also it will allow us to have different volume levels.

This addition is July 21 and I finally tried it with the Bluetooth television.  They work very well and I find I can follow dialog much better than with a speaker or soundbar.  I have one disappointment but it has nothing to do with the quality of these phones.  I had planned to buy a second set so two of us could take advantage of phones but apparently Bluetooth will only connect with one device at a time.

PROS:  For the price you can't beat them.  They look slick, came packaged well to avoid any shipping damage, are comfortable for me, have nice quality sound when they play, and the noise REDUCTION (not cancelling, will get to that later) is decent.  I like to use these when flying to help reduce noise and they do a good job.  The bluetooth set up is simple and the battery lasts a while on a full charge.

CONS:  There are only a few.  First of all these are NOT noise cancelling.  I know that's the official name of the technology employed, but it's very misleading to use that name.  They do not cancel out noise anywhere close to other high-end noise cancelling headphones.  Then again, these are 1/5 the price of those others so I wasn't ever expecting that level of quality.  But I just want anybody considering purchasing to realize these will do a nice job of lowering the noise level, but by no means will it cancel out.  As long as you know what you're getting and are OK with it, then this is a great buy.

Second, and this is just an annoyance for me, the volume up/down buttons are reversed from what would be logical.  To turn up the volume you push the down button, and to turn down the volume you push the up button.  Not a big deal once I got used to it, but it was a head scratcher.

I honestly would've still given 5 stars despite those first two concerns, since for <$70 they're a great deal, but now I'm starting to have sound crackling issues.  When I got them in January I was only using them while sitting at a workbench or painting doors, etc.  So staying very still it works.

I'm very impressed. It's my first experience with N.C. phones. I have not bought them sooner because most of the products I've seen are too pricey. When I saw these at under $60 I bought them... understanding that I might be disappointed.

I am delighted with them. First, they are COMFORTABLE! The headband has sufficient adjustment for me to wear them over a ball cap and still have the ear cups completely cover my ears.  On my morning walk today... with temperature in the high 30s, my ears were nice and warm. Second, the NOISE CANCELLING function works beautifully. While I have no prior experience with N.C. performance, these phones impress me. I need to be careful because I cannot hear vehicles approaching me from behind while I'm walking. Nor can I hear any other sounds except the Pandora tunes playing. The SOUND is excellent. The bass is wonderful. I'd like a little more treble for contrast, but I'm being picky here.

I have not yet received a phone call using them, but the CONTROLS are quite easy to operate. I don't think I'll have a problem when I do. I did purchase the warranty extension (for about $5) because some of the product reviews I read complained of product failures. If I do have the need to make a warranty claim I may edit this review... but I'm very happy with this product after 24 hours of receiving it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've had them for awhile now before reviewing them.  I like 'em. I don't love 'em.  They are fairly comfortable even for extended wear (say, 8+ hours at my desk).  Battery life is great, to the point where they'll ""suddenly"" die on me and then I'll realize that I can't remember the last time I actually had to charge them.  Also the noise cancelling works alright, it cuts out all the A/C drone in the office and reduces some of the other ambient noises.

  That's about where the positive things run out.  wiggling/moving/tapping the headphone (especially the ear cups) will make the bluetooth cut out and act funny.  Sound quality overall is so-so, across several types of listening, from rock, rap, and podcasts I was not really impressed with the sound quality.  Bass is not present in any meaningful way, and the higher frequencies are not especially pronounced either.

The controls are just about literally upside down and backwards.  a quick press of the + button will skip to the next song.  a long press (of varying length) will adjust the volume.  who does that?!  long-press to skip is just about the standard.  also the + button is on the bottom and the - button is on top.  so if you want to lower the volume, press and hold the top button with your right hand.  it just seems so counter-intuitive to the way controls are usually laid out.  My last comment is on the general build quality, especially where parts are attached together.  I really believe if these did not just live at my desk at the office, they would not survive a full year.  For the $50-70+ that these go for, I think there are probably some other options to explore.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I’m not a real audiophile so I can’t attest to how these sound with music. I listen to podcasts, audiobooks and TV and for that these headphones provide clear, strong audio and are relatively comfortable to wear. They fit completely over the ears so they filter out a lot of noise too. They don’t have the range that my Bose headphones do, so you can’t wander too far from your smartphone/tablet if you’re moving around.

What I don’t like about the Cowin headphones is that the controls are NOT very user-friendly. To start, the power switch is not a simple On/Off — it’s Off/BT/NC, so if you want Bluetooth (which is the main use for these), you have to manipulate the switch so it’s in the middle! Why?! Very awkward, and difficult to do without looking at it so you can’t do it (or at least I can’t) with the headphones on. Then, if you want to turn the volume up, you have to find the button on the BOTTOM and hold it down until the volume starts to go up. If you only press it once, you will advance whatever you are listening to to the next chapter, podcast or song, etc.!! And yes, you read that right, if you want to volume to go UP, you use the BOTTOM button; and if you want to volume to go DOWN, you use the TOP button…. Strange engineering, and completely not intuitive.

Once you figure out this strange layout, as  I said the quality of the sound is actually quite good. I use these headphones every day and I will continue to do so until they wear out completely, but I don’t think I would order this brand again unless the odd user-UNfriendly design elements were improved in future versions of this headphone. That being said, if you need a low-budget headphone that provides good, clear sound and are patient with the strange controls this could be good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The new headphones also seem to work better over bluetooth; the first pair stopped working after just a few feet while the new one works across the room.

Broke after a few months. Contacted Cowin International support. They directed me to Cowin Amazon support. They gave me a voucher code to get a replacement pair. Voucher didn't work. They told me the voucher only works for a day (I tried to redeem 2 days after they sent) and gave me a new voucher. Didn't work. They told me the voucher only starts working the next day.

Then was asked by am e-mail from Amazon-Don Winter, to remove my negative review and they would refund my money, so I did.
I was given the option to refund to the payment I have on file. I said yes, thinking I only have one that is current. They refunded the card I used 2 years ago that was closed when I switched banks. Now they say it's floating and I have to contact my bank, not hearing that a bank will not-can not look at an account closed. So Amazon Customer Service said I'm out of luck because they did there part refunding the money and washed there hands with it. They would not consider canceling the refund that's floating and refunding my current form of payment on file like they should have in the first place. Now I'm MAD! They talked to me like they were robots and the thinking was not in there program. Then, Lexi Snow with Cowin, E-mailed me with an offer I could not refuse. She replaced with an upgrade to the E8.

I happen to see these and right away I was taken back by the almost 9,000 reviews and 4 1/2 star rating!!!! Literally the price was the 2nd detail I looked at!!! 9,000 people can’t be wrong! I always check reviews before purchasing.
Back to my story...I bought these to use around the house. We have 5 kids, ages 5-20 so it gets pretty loud around here, and sometimes I just need to find my Zen :) (and sometimes my sanity too). I ordered them in black although I originally wanted white. When I received them 2 days later (I love my Amazon Prime!) the results were phenomenal. There is no excuse for spending extra hundreds of dollars when the sound & quality is conveniently made for the regular working woman/man at a price that is more than affordable. So I had to share this experience with my husband and gifted him the headphones (I knew there was a reason I ordered them in black). He’s using them to go to and from work. He has a long ride on the subway and the bus, and living in NYC makes the noise just that much LOUDER!
As if this couldn’t get better, (but wait it does) I registered his headphones and the warranty was extended! What kind of manufacturer extends their warranty to WELL OVER A YEAR?! COWIN THAT’S WHO!!!!! And I got a 20% discount on my second purchase!
So I ordered myself my white headphones. But this time I ordered the E7 Pro! I love these headphones! I’m an 80’s kid so it takes me back to my youth.
Long story short. These are worth every penny, you won’t be sorry you purchased them.
Tip... when using the volume buttons on the earphones , make sure your volume on your phone (I have an iPhone) is all the way up! If not you’ll hear a beep and that just means you’ve reached the max volume on your phone (not your headphones!) So “Pump up the volume” on your phone to experience the max volume on your new Cowin earphones.
ENJOY! I certainly am :)
Don’t forget to REGISTER for your extended warranty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I read reviews of the Cowin E-7 noise cancelling headphones and decided to try them. After fully charging the headphones per the directions, I switched on the noise cancelling function and there was hardly any difference between having the function on and just wearing the headphones with no noise cancelling enabled. Very disappointing. One of my co-workers has a pair of this type of headphone by a different manufacturer and his are great. However, they're also like 3-4 times the price of these Cowin's. Not being an audiophile, I don't listen to music off my other devices so I didn't want to spend serious money on the brand he has. I will say that the Cowin's are comfortable; they're somewhat lightweight and they do adjust well to head size. But since these didn't cancel noise very well at all, I returned them as they're not the right product for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I legit watch/listen to movies or catch up on my shows while at work or listen to podcasts and these things make the experience wonderful and I love when something makes multitasking wonderful.

Battery Life is awesome
Mobile (bluetooth)

Cons:
It sounds like you are talking in a tunnel
Nobody on the other end understands you
All of the music you listen too is distorted
There is a CONSTANT tick and static sound, even when no sound is playing. This is heard on both ends.

Edit: 6 months after I posted this I was contacted about a replacement. I had already received a refund, but they wanted me to update the review with information on a better headset. The sent me an upgraded SE7, not just the E7.  First, the feel of the thing is much better. It feels like quality. The sound is sufficient for most users, although it could use more bass on music from youtube it works great in general. Best yet, the disconnects, poor mic reception, and the constant clicks have all disappeared.

Why I am impressed: I just noticed that I have not charged these in mayb 4-5 days and they still have not died and stayed consistent. I'm a grad student and I'm always on the go so I often forget to charge my electronics. I don't even worry about charging these anymore because they last that long on one charge... and the sound does not cut off at all until it's absolutely about to die with a couple beeps warning before hand which I appreciate.

What to know:
I find that these are best at counceling out lower- bassy noises. So when my neighbors on the other side of my wall are blasting music I can cancel out the bass but you can still kind of hear the higher pitch noises. This isn't too much of an issue as I used ear plugs as well and this combo works very well. I suggest investing in ear plugs and these and you're pretty much sound proof without breaking the bank. BELIEVE ME ON THIS.

Features I like:
I really like how soft the muffs and handles are. The head set does not press so tightly on my head and does not give me a headache, so thats a HUGE plus. So if you're concerned about that these are a good set.

you can turn the noise canceling on and off.

Batteries are easily to access, but I don't see myself having to replace them anytime soon.

You can switch songs from the headset itself.

I bought this product for studying and it has actually helped me in my productivity. I suggest this for anyone trying to get a good pair of headphones on a budget. This is worth the investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sound quality: E7 is as good or even slightly better in bass. But the whole range is definitely richer. Most importantly, I can hear each and every details of my favorite songs.
Active noise canceling: I have not tried it on a plane but tried to listen to my music while vacuuming the floor. I feel it is as good or even slightly quiter than the Q15. Amazing!
Design and body: It is much more solid than the Q15. I don't feel it can be easily worn out or broken. The shiny stainless steel frame and gloss-coated plastic ear cups make it eye catching. The cup cushions are soft and comfortable. The cups are slightly smaller than the Q15 but can house my ears perfectly. The buttons are nicely positioned and very easy to use. It really looks like an expensive headphone. And it feels that way too.
Travel convenience: It came with a very light and soft pocket instead of a hard case. Even the headphone is slightly heavier, the whole package is lighter and less bulky. I don't worry the headphone may get squeezed in my bag because the construction is so solid and it won't! It only needs the soft pocket to prevent it from being scratched. Very thoughtful design!

Pros:
- Lighter than they look
- Ear cups perfectly fit over my ears (YMMV if your ears are really big)
- Comfortable cups
- Not so tight they give a headache
- Nice sound
- Noise cancellation works pretty well in most cases
- Bluetooth works
- Battery seems to last well when not in use
- A reasonable profile on your head - no huge gaps between the band and my head, ear cups not comically oversized
- included charging cable, aux cable to convert to a wired headset, and carry bag

Cons
- The shiny bits are not metal, they're plastic
- Noise cancellation could be better, but it's still pretty good.
- Oddly, the included drawstring case will not close completely over the headphones. I tried rotating the cups both ways. You probably COULD close it completely but it would squish the headphones in a way I don't feel comfortable doing. YMMV.
- The charging cable is still micro USB B instead of C. c'mon guys!

Caveats:
- Haven't tried the aux cable to turn them into a wired headset yet so can't comment on that
- I haven't been using them every day because I was at a conference, so I can't speak to battery life if used daily for, say, 4 hours or something.
- I'm not an audiophile. As long as I can hear some bass, mids, and treble, and it doesn't sound tinny, I dub the sound ""good""

For context, I've been using these on a bus to the airport, on an airplane, and in an AirBNB above *the* party street in Bilbao, Spain, where it gets quite noisy with people hanging out, drinking, eating at restaurants.

Noises successfully blocked:
- general party rumble noise (see note about party street above)
- most airplane cabin noise
- road noise
- most voices
- most noises you probably want to block (I suspect they'll work to block most reasonable coworker talking noise, coffee maker, etc, but haven't tried yet)

Noises NOT blocked:
- barking dog
- really loud yelling
- certain weird sounds made by the clothes washer (they're in the kitchen in Spain, so hard to escape)
- men whose voices carry
- airplane cabin announcements (I've heard that you can't even get headphones that will block this because of Safety Laws or something, but maybe those $xxx headphones would block them?)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I bought and immediately returned a pair from TauTronics that didn't work right, but even if the noise cancellation HAD worked on those, I really didn't like the tinny sound and the dull mids. I tried them against my fiancee's MPOW headphones, and hers sounded much better than the TauTronics.

So, rather than try for an exchange for a fully working pair of TauTronics, I was presented with a sale on the Cowin E7s. I'm glad they were on sale and that I bought them, because these have a great sound from the bass lows to the highs. I could go on about how I like the sound, how they're not QUITE as great as the Hesh 2 was, but for the cost I'm happy. The noise cancelling function is--meh. It clearly works, because when you slide the function button to NC, the overall sound of the music gets a little canny, but I couldn't tell a major difference in background sounds between the normal and the NC function. Perhaps if I tried them out in a much more noisy environment I'd reconsider my opinion, but I'm also not basing my like or dislike on this particular function.

Speaking of functions, the buttons on the Cowin are--different. This is my first pair of over-ear bluetooth headphones that actually have a slide switch to turn it on instead of a button you hold for a few seconds to turn on or off. I like the switch, but again, unlike every other pair of bluetooth headphones or earbuds I've ever used, when the phone connects you don't get a ""phone connected"" voice alert. It connects quickly, but the only way to be sure it's connected is to hit ""play"" and see if it's in your ears or to check your device's bluetooth setting to see whether it's connected.

Another unusual quirk is the levered volume/skip button. It's basically a v-shaped rocker switch, which is fine, except that to turn the volume UP you press the lever button DOWN...and vice versa. You get used to it, but that's NOT intuitive. That same button is used to skip songs forward or back, and that case you press it once (again, down for forward, up for back). To adjust volume, you have to hold the button up or down. I've had other headphones that you have to raise or lower the volume incrementally with each press of the button, and a long press is what skips forward or back. Frankly, I prefer the latter, but again, I have (mostly) adapted quickly to the Cowin process.

I've used these for probably about 15 hours now on a single battery charge; not sure how much longer they'll last till a recharge but honestly, I'm impressed with 15 hours. A definite plus for these vs. those beloved old Hesh 2's: the Cowins are REALLY comfy. After about two hours with the Hesh phones on, my ears would be a bit achy and I'd need a break. I think I wore the Cowins on the first day for about three hours and only took them off because I had to go somewhere, and my ears felt fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The product arrived in a a nice box and presentation. Upin unpackaging the bluetooth setting ws very easy to connect. One thing to mention, make sure you charge your headphones before you attempt to use them, once the battery is low the headphones will lose the microphone feature first to indicate low battery. It also has an indicator to assist.  The headphones are very comfortable on the ear. After multiple web classes the headphones were good for noise cancellation, easy to hear others, and the microphone was clear for the listener to understand me clearly.

Pros first:
They are amazingly comfortable, even on my big head.
They feel strong and sturdy, I suppose time will tell, but they seem good.
The audio quality is awesome and clear.
The noise cancellation cuts out noise from the surroundings and from what you are listening to, it does not take out voices of people talking, it makes them softer, but does not cut out voices.
I love the look and feel of the headphones, I have never had such a nice looking and feeling pair of headphones.
I signed up and have received the extended warranty from the manufacturer, that is a nice bonus.

OK now cons...
The sound quality is better when you use the cable, it doesn't affect the mic, but it does make a large improvement on the quality of the sound.
The Mic is bad, I wanted these headphones so that I can do voice or video calls with my pc or my phone and I would not be able to keep up a conversation with the quality of the microphone. I attached a recording for reference. It sounds like a bad laptop mic or a telephone conversation with bad signal, its hollow and distorted. When you start talking at a normal pace the other person can barely understand you as you sound so faint. I even tried with taking the headphones off and talking into the mic directly, but no improvement. Maybe I got a dud or something as I read many reviews and the consensus seemed to be that the mic was very good and clear. This is majorly unfortunate and I may end up needing to buy a mic for calls from my pc.

This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and I haven't gotten one until now due to funds or fear of buying a bad pair and being stuck with an expensive headpiece lol. I am disappointed in the mic, but maybe the point is to not buy wireless medium level gear as the money is saved somewhere, but overall I am very happy with the headphones and would recommend to others who don't care about the mic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Comfort?
The way they're made is super comfortable. They don't squeeze your head or your ears or anything that would result in you having a headache. Instead they gently clasp onto your ears, super nice.
Battery life?
The battery life on these is superb. I would only charge mine once a week and even then I've never had these headphones die on me.
Bluetooth range?
The Bluetooth range on these blew me away. I can walk around my entire house without the loosing connection, even when the laptop is upstairs and I'm in the garage.
Delivery?
Arrived in two days. They come in a nice box that I use for storing them in as well as come with a faux leather case for travel.
COWIN company & warranties?
And COWIN support is amazing, I've used their headphones for a while, they will honor all warranties. One of my old (like really old) headphones broke a while ago way past the 18 month warranty, and they still replaced mine and even upgraded me to a newer version for free. The lady who helped me gave me her phone number to text for any other questions or anymore help. So I'm definitely loyal to their brand.

These are extremely frustrating headphones for a person who is used to simply plugging in a pair of headphones and listening to whatever they wish. That, apparently isn't how these type of headphones work. No, these need to be charged constantly, just like a smart phone, and they will not work if you bang your head. Now, if you're like me - I am a punk and metal head, and when I listen to music, I tend to bob my head up and down... but this device is not made with that in mind, every time I bang my head (let's say in the downward motion) the sound cuts off. Extraordinarily frustrating for me.

I now know that I will never again purchase a pair of blu-tooth headhones again, as they do not do what I want them to do unless my head is remaining perfectly still - for example, when I watch Game of Thrones or something - but will not work when listening to the music that I enjoy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Let me start by pointing out that the vast majority of the reviews giving these headphones five stars are fake.  If you don't believe me, check fakespot for yourself.

Now on to the headphones (for full disclosure, I should point out that I'm comparing these against a pair of Sony WH-CH700N, which I just picked up for $89.99 so I'm comparing them to a better pair of cans, but not a comically better pair.)  The Sony are, to put it mildly, vastly superior.  The first thing that jumps out at me is the construction and design.  The Cowin's feel cheap and poorly constructed, like they'll break if not used gingerly.  The Sony headphones are much better engineered and you can feel it.  The slide is better, the material is stronger and unlike the Cowin's. they actually stay on my head when getting up out of a recliner.

I'm not an audiophile, but I now understand why people are.  Listening to the Sony headphones after using the Cowin, I'm shocked at how much clearer and better my music sounds.

As for noise cancellation, the Cowin's make some weird background humming.  It makes the mediocre sound quality outright unbearable.  I don't really care about this because I don't use noise cancellation, but if that's your thing, be warned.

Finally,  bluetooth range.  My Cowin's start breaking up after about 6-7 feet.  For reference I just tested the Sony headphones and was able to walk 25 feet away without so much as a hiccup.

Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money on these poorly designed headphones.  You'll just end up with buyer's remorse like me, wanting your money back.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound was good. The noise canceling gave him a headache. And one of the ear cup things rotated way too far around immediately when he got it. But he thought it was supposed to and never told me until he had had it for a few months and one day asked me why the one turned so much and the other didn't and I looked at it and it was broken. And very shortly after that he fell asleep sitting on the couch wearing them, it slid off his head, and the broken cup finished breaking.

The sound quality would be worth the money if the construction were decent.

We threw them away months ago. And I just ran in to the box and got annoyed cause school is about to start and he needs another headset. Guess what I'm not buying?

After several months of watching her glue old pair, I decided to surprise her with a new pair. I was looking for a noise canceling pair for her to listen to audio books while I watch sporting events in bedroom. I chose the E-7 bc of the many reviews, over 2500, also about 80% positive customer ratings. The price range was excellent too, @$70.  I'm not sure why ppl spent $200-300 on a pair of headphones. However, I was a little skeptical bc I hadn't heard of this Cowin brand. But I decided to go with it. I was slightly impressed once they arrived w/ the way they were packed in it's box. After my wife charged them I decided to try them out listening to music on my phone while she was at work. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 for the quality of sound, nice deep bass but not too overwhelming on the ears!! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 for comfort & look. I guess my only problem...I've been wearing them more than my wife. My wife has advised me that she wants her own pair of Cowin E-7. I ditched my SkullCandy brand & only use them to cut grass now. So I'll be ordering another pair really soon. The noise canceling works great w normal level noises & surrounding conversations. Battery life is awesome in my opinion too.

The ear pieces are very soft and fit snuggly but not too tight. I used these on two 12-hour flights and they still had a charge.

The audio quality is good with a rich, deep base and high notes that aren’t  tinny. These do not completely cancel outside noises/sounds but reduces significantly.

I was using earbuds plugged into my phone to cancel out the random voices around my office, which I would have to max out to block out maybe 80% of the noise.  Meanwhile, I'm sure I was causing hearing damage.

I didn't want to pay two or three hundred dollars for the expensive ones, so I went with these based on price and reviews.  I wasn't expecting them to be this nice though.

They arrived on time.  They come in a heavy cardboard box with foam cutouts usually assocated with higher tier electronics.  They are attractive and are the perfect weight.  Not too heavy, but heavy enough to feel substantial.  They wrap around your head with every contact point cushioned and soft.  They literally feel like they are hugging your head.  After charging at home, I turned them onto the noise cancelling setting.  My home office is a fish room, with air pumps, bubbling aquariums, and a set of overly noisy computer fans.  I could still hear them, but they were now relegated to being sounds far and away.  They could have been outside from how they sounded.  Then I paired the headphones with my phone and played a few songs (mostly cinematic instrumentals for concentration purposes).  The sound is simply amazing.  The deep notes and strings come through beautifully.  All of the tinniness is gone, and you feel surrounded by the music instead of it being injected into your head.  In addition, I am able to listen to it at half of the volume that I had it set at.

They look amazing, like quite expensive look and the little blue light next to the buttons adds a futuristic gadget touch. (fingerprints tend to happen a lot in the shiny parts) I know they make my co-workers jealous.

They sound amazing, I notice no difference while having them plug-in or via bluetooth.

The only difference is when I turn on the noise cancelling function, outside noise does get cancel out like 50%, but once you turn on the music is 100%, cant hear a thing. Fire Alarms,Sirens, Nuclear Warnings cant reach me, wear them in a safe place.

I got them on a wednesday and charge them that day.
I use them at the office:

Thursday-Friday use
Week 2 Monday-Friday use
Week 3 Monday-Friday use

Until Week 4 on Monday had to charge them, battery life is amazing.

About the comfort, not heavy and they feel very soft on your ears, but I kinda need to adjust them quite a bit for my left ear.

These headphones are fairly comfortable to wear.  The Bluetooth wireless connection function works, but can be confused if the headphones are used first paired with a TV and then brought near a PC that happens to have Bluetooth.  And if paired with that PC, and thereafter attempted to be used with the TV to which they were previously paired, there may be some difficulty clearing the previous pairing and re-pairing.  Even the original pairing with my 2017 TV was not immediately successful, and instead required several tries despite no other Bluetooth devices anywhere in range.  The range of the Bluetooth function of these headphones appears to be rather variable, sometimes working beyond 30 ft while at many others not working reliably when only 10 ft from the source to which they are paired.

Corded function also requires the battery within these headphones to be charged.  And the headphones must be turned off in order to recharge.  Thus, if the battery runs low while listening using the Bluetooth function, you cannot simply connect these headphones directly to your TV or PC via the min--jack cord and continue to listen.

You need to remember to turn off the power when finished using these headphones or the battery will likely be drained when you pick them up the next day to use them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They also have an inline mic that is not the greatest. I didn't get this for the mic though. I mostly use this for casual use since I've gotten tired of wires trippin' out on me.

1. Appearance 7/10 - It's made of plastic. It feels cheap but that's also a benefit, since it is quite light on the head. It came in a nice box with a microUSB - USB charger, slightly shorter than 2 feet. It does not come with a bag or anything to hold it, so if you're looking to have something to put it in for carrying, you'll have to get that separately. I bought a wireless bluetooth adapter to plug into my laptop, and while the sound won't go through thick walls or around corners easily, I'm plenty happy to have it at maximum quality while I'm in my room.
2. Sound Quality 7/10 - They have average sound quality. It doesn't get too bassy, and it's not too rough on the higher frequencies. I've used these headphones for some music mastering and they do an okay job (they pass on music editing but they're not that great), but they should be perfectly fine for casual use. There is a slight decrease in performance when the noise cancelling is turned on but it's not that noticeable to me. By using the cable that comes with the device, you can get a wired connection. I haven't noted any significant increase in performance by wiring it up though, and the microUSB - USB that comes enclosed does not do a great job of keeping the connection stable for wired listening. However, the cable provides a decent enough connection to charge. You buy these things for the wireless capability anyways.
3. Noise Cancelling 8/10 - The great part is the noise cancelling part. My bathroom is rather close to my room, but I can turn on the fan and then turn on the noise cancelling and it reduces the noise by a ton. Unfortunately, it won't reduce noise like bed-springs coming from the room above me.
4. Battery Life 9/10 - I've had these headphones for a little over a month now, and I can say that the battery life seems to be doing okay. You see, there isn't a great indicator of battery life on these things. FYI When fully charged the red light at the base of the headphones will turn off, and when they run out of battery they emit a sad sound after you try to power it up before it dies again. After having forgotten to charge the headphones for a few days, my estimate is that they last for about 25 hrs on bluetooth. I haven't checked the battery life with the noise cancelling on, but I would suspect around 10 hrs.
5. Comfort 6/10 - Well honestly, they're a nice balance for me. They feel comfortable around the ears and all, and the material surrounding the ears is nice. However, it should be noted that these headphones do tend to feel a bit tight. It doesn't bother me too much because if I have them on for that long, then I feel that it is a good health indicator to myself that I've probably been wearing them for too long.
6. Durability - I'm not quite too sure on this point. I've noticed that sometimes switching it off doesn't quite switch it off and it tries to connect. I've gotten around this point by flipping it all the way to noise cancelling, then going back to switch it to off. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. I get the feeling that it might be related to a low battery since it has only happens then, but I'm not certain. The headset itself is quite durable.

- well balanced sound like bass/tremble, etc - sounds pretty great to me.
- movies, music and video games sound better than my last 2-3 headphones.
- Comfortable
- Premium feel

Cons:
- Not loud enough over the bluetooth on my PC. But noise cancellation basically ensures that you'll hear everything, it's just that level of immersion is lost for when you want extra loudness in a movie of a video game. You'll hear everything, but it'll be unrealistically quiet breaking the immersion if that makes sense.
I would have returned headphones without noise cancellation that are so quiet, but because of noise cancellation it kind of works. And other pros outweigh this one con.

Imagine your TV have a volume and you have like 20 bars and sometimes you want to set it at 15, but this TV malfunctioned and only allows you to set it at 13 max? That's basically what's missing for me when it comes to volume for these headphones. Most of the time for casual things it works great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Thumbs up on this one. The contents inside were well packaged and padding to protect from shock was well done. Check my pics for unboxing.

Only thing that could have been better is if I had a hard case instead of leather pouch.

Material and finish:
I love the finish of the headphone. It looks classy. The metals add to the look as well as serves as hardware switch for volume

Audio and experience:
Bass is great. Fits right only your ears with right pressure (tight fit causes sense of itchy and sweaty sensation over ears after prolonged wear) so I was finding it comfortable listening to music for long time.

It is not noise cancelling as much as I thought(i could hear tv audio in my living room) but definitely cuts ambient noise.

Within an hour of posting my original 2-star review, COWIN reps reached out to me to address my concerns. After a few messages, and understanding that I had already returned the original pair I had purchased on Amazon, Joey from COWIN issued me a complimentary pair described as being ""higher quality"" for my review. I was not certain if this would mean E-7 v2.0 or just a replacement of what I had previously purchased. After receiving the replacement product, I believe it implied a replacement of the same version but one that lacked the quality control-related issues as was observed with the first pair.

Based on my experience thus far, COWIN's customer support is unbelievably good. If I were rating my review on this interaction alone, they would definitely receive 5-star review. However, this is a product review, so there are many other factors to be considered.

Audio Reproduction Quality: 3.5 / 5
Overall, audio sounds warm, bassy, and not as crisp as some of its competitors. With Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) disabled, external noises are amplified, creating an echo chamber-like experience, indicating a sound leak. I believe this is due to less padding and smaller ear cups when compared to other similar products in the same price bracket. That being said, I would rate the audio quality as slightly above average. Engaging the ANC feature seems to muffle or dampen the audio like having a wet towel over your head between you and the audio source.

Comfort: 4 / 5
The light weight construction is the main factor that determined how I felt about the comfort level of these headphones. I'm a bigger guy with a larger head. While the ear cups fit nicely, I feel that increasing the thickness of the ear cup would go a long way in terms of comfort and reducing the level of audio leak.

Appearance / Aesthetics: 4 / 5
From the piano black finish to the chrome, the COWIN E-7's look pretty sharp from a distance. Up close, you realize the set is mostly plastic, but material choice plays a huge factor in weight and comfort. They definitely have an above-average appearance.

Battery: 5 / 5
Battery life seems to last for the claimed time. Supposedly, it is also replaceable which is definitely a plus.

Interface / Getting Started / Ease of Use: 5 / 5
It appeared as though the box lid was improperly cut/sized but this is about headphones, which were well protected during shipment. Among the easiest bluetooth headphones I've used when it comes to pairing. There didn't seem to be any special button pressing required. I simply turned them on and scanned for them on my devices. Instructions are included in the bottom of the box. Perhaps my favorite feature on this headphone set is the lack of obnoxious audio notices that are sometimes present when adjusting the volume, indicating battery levels at various stages, or accompanying power functions.

Connectivity: 4.5 / 5
Bluetooth is limited to roughly 10 meters in ideal environmental conditions. This will generally imply a clear line-of-sight (LOS) in an outdoor environment away from any metal or bodies of water that can impede performance. When compared to my other bluetooth devices in the same environment, the COWIN E-7's performed well, on par with other similar bluetooth products.

NOTE: DISCORD USERS -- THE INABILITY TO PLAY AN AUDIO TRACK WHILE CONNECTED TO A VOICE CHANNEL IS A FAULT WITH DISCORD, NOT THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO DEVICE.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Nice soft case included, solid battery life before a charge is needed. Comfortable.  Sound is OK. I can hear office noise around me, but it's not terrible. (i.e. Not exactly Noise Cancelling.) OK for the price. Customer Support is poor. In September my Aux cord stopped working. No Sound. Warranty for headphones is for eighteen (18) months. I emailed customer support and followed all the troubleshooting instructions they suggested. I was told my cord would be replaced if needed. After troubleshooting (charging, bluetooth check, cleaning, swapping out cords) realized the original Aux Cord was faulty. I replied to Support again with the results asking for the warranty to be covered for the Aux Cord. I immediately got bounce back emails. (6-8 Bounce backs ""Recipient inbox full""; several days in a row) Also, the support phone number on the website goes straight to voice mail; No professional identification as Cowin on the voice recording and tells me I've reached ""xxx-xxx-xxxx"" - a completely different number than the Support# listed. Who knows who is at the number listed. I've not been able to reach Cowin since.

UPDATE Got an email from Cowin customer service, October 2018: ""Thank you for your interest in our replacement parts but we are not selling/replacing them. We are very sorry for this discrepancy, But the only solution is to find another aux cable in your local tech store or amazon!""","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I’m a very casual music listener—usually in the car or sometimes via Bluetooth speakers at home. I bought these to listen to music on my phone and possibly take while traveling. I love my bass-heavy music and EDM, so I wanted something decent sounding. These are very decent and good for sixty bucks. I tried listening to a couple of popular film scores, pop, hip hop, dance, rock, and a headphone testing video off YouTube. These headphones sound clear, have a good stereo sound effect, and decent enough bass (better than the ones from five below and better than Apple EarPods). I played around with the EQ settings and there are noticeable differences. None of them have the extreme bass sound of the Skullcandy Crusher headphones but this one is cleaner/crisper sound for all genres.

My eleven year old son and my husband were both pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and appearance of these headphones. The packaging is beautiful and feels expensive. I like the pleather storage pouch it came with and that it was packed nicely without too much wasteful wrapping etc.

Considering these are plastic I can see why some people’s sets broke within a year; I think if these are kept in one spot (like just at home or just at work, etc) as opposed to traveling a lot with them, they could potentially last longer. I hope to mostly keep them at home so I’ll see if this works. I’ll also update after travel and some time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The headphones are very comfortable to wear for hours at a time and provide good sound quality. The Bluetooth connection lets you wander around (not too far, but that's typical for wireless). You can also use as a WIRED headphone to save battery life.

The Noise Cancellation works. Low frequencies disappear so car trips are a little quieter.  You'll still hear higher frequencies but even my $300 headset won't cut out all outside noise.  At this price the functionality is as good as it gets.

The only problem I can find... and I have to look hard... is the microphone.  There is just a little pinhole mic on the headset.  Your voice can sound hollow or distant.  It definitely works and is usable for Skype or other VoIP calls but it is not as good as a boom-style mic found in ""communication"" headsets.  These were purchased primarily for listening and not for chatting so I won't delete any stars.

We haven't tested the full battery life but have used these for several hours without any problems. If you want a sub $100 headset with noise cancellation then this would be a good place to start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have a desk job 8-5 so no gaming no jumping around. this thing broke in less than a year for what I used it for I think that was very quick, had to tape it and change the tape once a month (check photos)

on all fairness its not all bad news, it is very comfortable once it was working, the noise canceling feature is decent it is no Sony but its not $250  either.

overall I liked it - if it was not for the cheap plastic that broke that would have been a solid 5 starts but the headset falling apart makes it unusable.

Update 09/26/2019 - so these guys called me and refunded me, I never asked for a refund and I never contacted them on the count of I used it for more than few months but nevertheless they contacted me so if yours break give them a call you might get a new one - another thing the lady told me they have revised and it should be better now. so my take on this is the following: 5star service and possibly 5star for the revised version.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I use it for news, streaming videos, and, of course, music. After years of tripping over a headphone cord, this is blissful freedom. It's light and quite comfortable. I don't use the NC mode, it's not what I want and not using it, gives me much longer use per charge. I know there are better ones out there, but for use with my computer, this is near perfect.
Update: Still happy with the very comfortable E7 headphones. What I did not expect was that the moment I departed the room, things got very shaky and audio broke up or went dead entirely, until I reentered the room where the computer is located. Also, with distance, maybe 25 feet, they became directionally unstable, i.e. if I bent down to pick something up, the audio would break up. Same when I turned my head one way or the other.  I don't know if that's typical or just this particular headset. It may even be the ZEXMTE adapter that's the bottleneck. I can't tell without buying another brand and comparing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They work great over Bluetooth and using the included audio cable - in fact, you can use both at the same time, i.e. have it plugged into my desktop PC and connected to my phone via Bluetooth.

I've never used active noise cancelling headphones before this, I wasn't sure what exactly was supposed to be filtered out. It filters out rhythmic noise - fans, air conditioning, hard drive spinning, etc. If you have nothing playing, it actually makes other sounds like speech more distinct, albeit quieter due to covering your ears.

One other thing. If you have them turned on and paired to your phone, then take them off, you won't hear your phone ring because it goes to the headphones. I've missed a couple calls because of this. I started turning them off when I take them off for more than a minute or so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Comfortable/product-reviews/B019U00D7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
