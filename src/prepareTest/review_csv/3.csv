Good noise cancellation, good sound quality. After about thirty minutes I pressed the pause button on the earbuds for the first time, and they all the sudden just became terrible.
The right side stopped working almost completely, still with a very faint sound that is only heard when the volume is completely up, which deafens you in the other ear. I realized very shortly after that if I just touch the little piece with the buttons on them-not pressing the buttons-it either turns the volume all the way up, all the way down, or pauses what I'm watching/listening to. The left earbud also became a bit glitchy sounding.
This was all within the first hour of recieving the earbuds in the mail, so it's not my fault in the slightest.

They aren't terrible, but they leave something to be desired. They feel nice in my ears, and I like the low profile, and the cable feels high quality. Where they lack is in sound quality, which in my opinion is the most important aspect of an earphone. The mid-range and higher range sound good, in the top of the high range they sound a bit tinny. Where they really lack is in the low end. They are advertised with ""powerful bass"" and this just isn't accurate. The bass is definitely lacking, you need to actively think about listening to low end notes in order to hear them, which is disappointing.

The materials are good quality, and the sound is great.  I can't really attest to the noise cancellation, but I had no problem hearing my music or television programs over my iPhone.  There was one issue: I would not recommend these earbuds to anyone who intends to use them during a workout.  The volume controls on the cord were extremely sensitive, and as I started running, I found that the earbuds were constantly lowering the volume.  I tried a number of different ways of holding my phone to try to reduce the problem, to no avail.

Eventually, I swapped earbuds with my daughter - and she seems to be enjoying these as well.  Overall, I would recommend the earbuds for casual listeners, but I would not recommend them to anyone wishing to wear them during a highly active workout (like running/jogging).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But they quickly started acting up and don't exactly have the best sound quality anymore. The mic sounds terrible now, and the volume buttons on the cable stopped working. I liked them when i first received them, but now they just don't perform like they used to. The 3.5mm jack is not made strong enough, it has a slight bend and has had it for quite sometime now, despite the fact i take really good care of my headphones always. Not overly fond of the material that the cable was made from either; it gets tangles quite easily and won't stay coiled for clean storage. Not very comfortable either.

I was floored when I discovered the bass on these B25 with 9mm drivers was much more powerful than the bass in the BS10-RM with 12mm drivers. (It does say on the webpage the B25 has 10mm drivers, one of the reasons I purchased them, but they actually have 9mm drivers according to paperwork in the packaging. The only reason I'm not complaining about that is because the sound quality and bass are so good!)
The cord seems like it is a bit flimsy almost - like a thin metal cord wrapped in a thinner layer of rubber. I feel as though I will have to be very careful with this. The controls on the mic are easy to use, however the mic is a lot further away/further down the cord from the earbud.
The sound quality on these is such that I will probably use both pairs in regular rotation, depending upon activity, instead of just saving these for a back up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Over the years I have developed a rather annoying case of tinnitus that contributes to my lack of being able to fall asleep soundly. I use earbuds at night to sleep. These have been quite a godsend, their weight keeps them planted in my ears, and the unique cord construction and coating prevent banging sound transfer to the buds, or dull it so much I don't notice it. The only negative aspect of these may be the silicone tips aren't all that great but they are serviceable.

Sound on these are wonderfully flat. I don't like earbuds that try to EQ for you. If you have an EQ app on your phone or other device you can tweak to your hearts content. Phone calls sound great, and I find myself really using them more throughout the day because of they are so comfortable.

Sound quality is pretty good, noise cancellation reasonably good but not the best. I am not giving a higher score for two reasons:

- The shape of the earbuds is not very smartly designed; the plastic attachment has the exact same diameter as the metal part, which caused the latter to come in contact with the inside of my ears - sometimes uncomfortably and a bit painfully. Using a larger plastic attachment caused the sound to not be as good.
- The part where the cable ends to connect with devices became broken after not too long, exposing the metals inside the cable and rendering it useless.

In sum, not a terrible product, but there's definitely better options for the same price. Won't be buying again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound quality is decent. They fit inside your ear canal snugly. Ear pieces are soft rubber and come in a variety of sizes to fit all ears. I especially like the heavier cord that makes it easy to keep them untangled.

I'd rate them 5 stars except you don't get Bose sound quality for 15 bucks. And the control is a bit hard to find and too close to the head. It is a simple and well-designed control. There's only passive noise reduction but that's also a plus since you don't have to charge these ever.

I needed some wired earbuds to keep my phone's battery drain down from using Bluetooth earbuds. Sadly these earbuds sound a lot more muffled than my current wireless SoundPEATS. I have to turn the volume higher than I normally do to get the same volume and even then the sound quality is a lot less clear.

It's a shame really, otherwise they'd be (at best) decent slightly above average earbuds with good environmental noise cancelation and solid volume control

Update- The left bud no longer works properly. I get sound, but not all of it, if at all. It becomes a garbled mess while the right one works just fine. What's more, when using it with my work radio, the left bud suddenly works just fine but the right one gets no audio at all! Keep in mind that I rarely used them. Now I have no usable earbuds for work or home and will have to go back to Bluetooth and drain battery again.

The end of last year, I ran across some ""Bertron"" earphones that were about the same price, and ordered them. They came in a sweet box, and we gave her them for Christmas. She was quite pleased with them, and was hesitant about using them, they were so pretty.
That model went up in price, so I ordered a ""lesser"" earphone from them, and she seemed quite pleased with them. Then I made the mistake of listening to them. Blew my Sony headphones away. Suffice it to say, the last time I ordered these, I ordered 2 pair...one for when she destroys the ones she's using, and the other for me.

For the price, I haven't found any that come close to the sound quality of these, and they look great. And as I'm disabled, and on a fixed income, price IS important...

Edit: I finally had one set that had a defect. The cable to the right earphone was intermittent where it came out of the controls. I boxed them back up, took it to the UPS store down the street, ordered another set, and had the refund in a couple of hours. I'm still impressed with the quality and the sound...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I got all of that with this product. They are not super high sound quality earbuds, but then I do not expect that from earbuds. Nor are they super noise cancelling - again, not something to expect from earbuds. Yet the quality is acceptable. What I do like is that unlike standard vinyl corded earbuds, the braiding make them somewhat more resistant to getting tangled in my pocket or computer bag. A major complaint I have long had about earbuds is that sometimes I am unable to get them unwrapped quickly enough to answer the call for which I am trying to use them! I then have to answer the call, use the speaker phone while I fumble with the earbud cord, and then eventually get them plugged in. When doing anything (cycling, walking, fixing lunch, typing at my keyboard), it is sometimes not even worth it. These seem to have address that problem; not perfectly, but somewhat better than vinyl.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It started a little over two weeks ago I got my first set of Betron earbuds the sound was ok and I was off. I was messing around with my kid climbing this tall jungle gym thing and when I got to the top saw the jack had snapped in half. My fault I thought must have really snagged it, kind of liked them so I ordered a new set this time with the buttons.

This set came and I really liked it, the buttons actually worked the cabling felt nice and smooth, comfortable in the ear, the whole package, but getting in the car today the new set snagged for a second and broke in the same way as the first.

I've never seen this before and for it to happen twice from the same manufacturer makes me assume there is a fault with the jack piece that desperately needs fixing.

 It's a pity because I actually liked these, maybe this is a good choice for you if they just sit on a desk and you never move with them?","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Well, I forgot once, and plugged these in to exercise with. To my surprise, they have very good fidelity. They are a little strong in the 3-4K range but have plenty of bottom end. As most earbuds do, they isolate outside noise fairly well and feel comfortable. There is a bit of extra noise transmitted along the cord if your exercising motion rubs against said cord, but that's fairly easily solved. It even comes with a plastic, spring-loaded clip to hold the cord for strain relief which helps. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would buy it again if it gets lost or broken. They're no PowerBeats, but they make a good standby.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The mid/treble is the most shallow sound I have heard out of earbuds. There s absolutely no bass, so don't buy the ""powerful bass"" claim. I literally cannot hear the bass in any of the songs I tested with these- which I chose because they have a range of treble/mid/bass (all of which were weak, but bass was the worst).
Also, these are not noise cancelling, but I did not expect them to be so that isn't a huge deal for me. The big deal is the all-around terrible sound quality.

Do not buy these if you are reading this. Not even worth the $15. Pay a little bit more and get earbuds that are actually decent if you care at all about music.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Almost immediately, the cover for the plug broke off and is sliding around the cord. No big deal, mostly just a cosmetic thing but kind of annoying for sure. Then, when I plugged them into my computer and tried to change the volume, I learned that the headphones automatically either adjust the volume all the way up or down if you click the +/- volume buttons once. You have to double click the button and hit the exact volume that you want as it increases/decreases – pretty annoying. Also, sometimes it will randomly turn the volume all the way up which can surprise you with some ear pain. I would never buy these again, spend a few more dollars and get a real product instead of something shiny that works like crap.

The earbuds themselves are made of metal, so can be a bit cold when first putting in, but then warm up from your body heat. Don’t feel uncomfortable to me, but may depending on your ear shape?

The cable material is really distinct from a distance and the metal buds look super slick. The default rubber tips fit me perfectly with fantastic noise cancellation. The included alternate tips will work for larger or smaller ears.

Unfortunately, the sound quality is worse than I expected. I'm not an audiophile, so if I describe these poorly, I'm sorry, but I found these lacking in bass. It sounds muddled, like my music is missing a lot of depth. I would almost describe it as cheap, if that makes sense. I'm also worried about the durability of these things. I'm very hard on my earbuds, since I use them at night while I sleep, and I usually have to replace my earbuds every six months or so. After a few days of use, I fear these will end up the same, though it should be noted that they are still basically mint condition.

All in all, it's a 3 star product, but it's also not that expensive, so I wouldn't worry too much if you aren't an audio snob.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was skeptical of the quality being the price was so affordable. I had no need to worry. These little ear buds are great! I used the almost the whole trans Atlantic flight both ways. Not only was the sound quality great, but they greatly reduced the engine/cabin noise. I will agree with the description that these are ""Noise Reducing"" not noise cancelling ear buds. You can still hear light muffled sound through them, but for the price they do an amazing job of tuning out the ambient noise. The sound quality is rich and clear. A pleasure to listen to.
The only negative feed back I have is that it is terribly hard to change the cushions on them. My ear openings are small so before even using them I switched to the smallest size. It was so difficult that I almost gave up and sent them back. I'm glad I kept trying though cause they were worth the trouble.
I did not use the built in mic or the volume control, but adjusted the volume on my phone instead so I can not speak to these features.

2. When I want to put the earphone into my ear to make sure it is stable, this earphone will make a loud noise, perhaps because the internal parts of the earphone are oppressed by my finger.
3. Because of the metal material, the earphone will be quite cold when they are placed in the ear during cold days and make your ear feels uncomfortable.

The problem with these, and many other earbud models, is that unlike the KE29s, the drivers are not vented. When inserted into the ear, such that noise is isolated, a vacuum is formed that effectively locks the foil of the driver such that it cannot vibrate. In this condition, volume is very low and lows vanish. It is very difficult to get these aligned such that they function and isolate sound.

UPDATE:
I'm adding two stars. After trying every silicon ear piece size, I finally found one that resulted in EXCELLENT SOUND!

Also because the ear buds are so tight in your ear, you hear  the cable rubbing along your zipper or your shirts, (even if you use the smaller in-ear covers, its still not a pleasant feeling.

Sound quality is fine.
Durability is ok.

The cable doesn't have anything to prevent it from getting bound or tangled, there are other ear buds that have better cables so you don't have to deal with tangled wires.

 I would not buy these again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The inside tunnels that should fit on the bud body itself are thicker and more rigid than the Sony tips I'm used to. Edit: I forced a pair of Sony rubber tips on these earbuds. Took awhile but still easier than wrestling with the ones provided.

They're good buds and work fine despite the manhandling I gave them. Cord seems very durable yet flexible. The clip is very helpful for sleeping in these... clip to a pj top and they’re less likely to wrap around your neck. The sound has been fine. The full iPod inline controls work but are honestly not real intuitive in a dark room.

Biggest problem is that the buds from inner-ear tip to outside are just a little too long. I bought these for sleeping, and the length makes it hard to side-sleep, unlike my old Sonys that have become increasingly difficult to replace. Also, there's metal on them, so they can be COLD when you first shove 'em in your ear. But the length is the reason I find I'm just not using them and am searching for another pair.  (Adding the Sony rubber ear pieces did NOT add to the length.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The issue I had was when walking or running, the earphones would have a clicking sound that would increase or decrease the volume. As you might imagine, the volume became incredibly loud or incredibly quiet when walking around. This is most likely due to a defect in the sound control located on the wire of the right-side earbud.

The earphones are not 'noise cancelling'. They fit very snugly, thus block out 80% of sound from the outside, but they do not negate the outside noise frequencies via a microphone or any other technology.

My earphones broke within 2 months. They were good for the price and sound quality while they lasted but definitively not a product I would want to buy in the future. In my case, the right-side earphone broke at the junction between the wire and right earbud.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The cord seems a little thinner than I'm used to, but still pretty sturdy. I popped in the earbuds and started playing a couple of songs I know have a great range of tones, and the bass on these things is really impressive for the price. The noise cancelling is above average as far as earbuds go. My husband is hard of hearing so he usually has the tv up pretty loud. I had these in and turned up my music and there was no residual sounds coming in.

The volume changing feature is great. My only beef with that is since we hear music more clearly in our left ear (and conversation is on the right, if you don't believe me, pay attention to the ear you turn to someone when you can't hear them clearly), the volume control should be on the left side.

I hope these last me a good long time.

Coming from the Apple earbuds to these, there is definitely a difference.  Apple ones are a much richer/warmer sound, but I think it's because there is actual bass coming from those.  Like I said, these have no bass, but considering these are half the price, I guess you have to pick what's more important to you.
I just got these, so the durability would have to be seen, but out of the box, they seem very durable.
In my opinion, very decent for cheap earbuds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But I live in a really cold environment, and any time I put in my headphones and drop my phone into my coat pocket, the static that generates through the cord is aggravating. At times you can just hear the sound of static running through when removing the jacket or other ""wintery"" clothing like a sweater. But other times, just walking is enough to send sound interruptions into your ears, like a weird ""clicking"" sound.

Additionally, with this static comes a tendency to adjust the volume on the device you are using. Typically the volume is turned way down, and practically goes to 0%. But a couple of times I've heard a couple of static clicks and then BOOM, MAX VOLUME. Sound quality is okay, but I would not recommend purchasing unless it's a hard-pressed emergency.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They drown out a remarkable amount of noise, and this is without cranking the volume to 10.  Adding to that, they sound really good.

I thoroughly enjoyed them. They do indeed cancel noise decently enough and the sound quality is pretty good for the size. I was not a fan of the wire design as it didn't bend much compared to most other headphones. The wire is encased in one layer, and then a slippery layer over that. Or so it seemed to  me at least. This lack of bending may seem good, but over time, the stiffness of the wire eventually led to the end connected to the audio jack to slightly tear (as in the internal wire became exposed). It worked fine for a week, but then stopped working entirely a week after. Maybe the two are connected, maybe not. Either way, I kept the headphones away from water, so I am not sure why it just stopped working.

Secondly, the design causes external shuffling noises to overtake the noise in the headphone. What I mean by this is that the shuffling any headphone may do as it bounces around throughout the day causes a lot of the shuffling noise to be heard. I think its due to the design of the headphone, causing all vibrations to travel from end to end without enough dissipation. Please fix these issues. Otherwise, these are some of the best headphones I have used.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Ideally, they have strong cables, since I have a tendency to absentmindedly chew on wires. Yes, like a hamster.

I've had these headphones for a few months so far, and I like them. The rubber wires seem durable, the sound is good, they're very comfortable. If I remember correctly, I was impressed by the selection of rubber earplug sizes. I have small ear canals and these are very stable and never fall out.

The only problem I have with them is that they are very susceptible to static electricity. Often while I am at my desk, I will shift and some static electricity sparks along the wire. The spark then makes my computer think I pressed the ""volume down"" button - which means that every few days my headphones mute all my sound of their own accord.

The cord is woven and has a coating over it.  I have found this coating to be helpful in that it reduces the amount of tangling it does while in my pocket.  It also helps in making it easier to untangle the cord when it does get that way. The position of the earphones in your does affect the sound, so I have to move them around a bit to get it just right. It's just a minor inconvenience now after i have got used to it.  When they are in the right position and you have the correct size of buds on for your ear the noise isolation works well, but you do have to get them in just right.

I mostly use headphones for listing to music, and will use them as a headset for my Xbox One which is why i needed the one with a mic. I found great reviews on these and for a decent price so wanted to try them out.

I AM COMPARING THIS TO MY AKG by Samsung, (which speaker went out on oneside but just came back).

Even with my old headphones in good shape now im going to give these a shot.

Sound Quality:
The sound quality is actually very good! Im impressed by such a low cost! They are not headphones but for ear buds they are top of my list even better then my AKG which I thought were amazing. You get a nice bass at all volume levels and at higher levels the quality is still great and crisp/clear.

Durability:
I cant say to much since this is a day 1 review, i am going to try and come back in a month to do a follow up on how well they are! But initial thoughts is the cord is ""Fake"" Braided because it has the look of a nice ""steel"" braided line like higher quality earbuds but just is a plastic coating over them. The cord itself i think is the weakest link because the Earbuds, Mic/Volume control/3.5mm Jack all feel solid and durable. We will see how long they last from a daily use as a college student in a Midwestern climate (Harsh Winter and Summer). (I will also update the stars for Durability is they prove me wrong).

Noise Cancellation/Fitment:
This is the biggest issue i have with these earbuds, they are gummy pods which are not a bad thing and you receive multiple sets of gummy's to swap for different ear canal sizes. After I tried multiple I found the smallest shallow buds the best. They fit snug in my ear however not a tight fitment or seal and noise cancellation is not the greatest because of the poor fitment. I may have weird ear's I dont know. But my AKG fit amazing in my ears with the off center curved gummy's. These fit... alright. The noise cancellation is decent. But fitment prevents it from being a 5/5.

Overall for $15 these headphones sound GREAT! Just fitment is my biggest concern with these earbuds... I hope to return in the future to update my review using them for 30 days on my phone and Xbox.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

However, I really enjoy listening to music through Betron B25.  I listen to pop, jazz, and classic.  The sound is amazingly clear.  Because I used to play the drum, I tend to focus on how they play them.  I can hear the sound so clearly that I would like to play them again.  I am not sure about the durability yet since I just started using this set a few days ago.  The set is dark silver and kind of cool.  I think it cancels the noise pretty well.  My other earbuds tend to slip out from ears frequently, but this set seems to stay in my ears better.  Also, I bought Berton B25 because it is NOT wireless.  Overall, I am loving this Berton B25.

The sound and quality are amazing for what you pay for these. Well worth it. Be sure to ensure a good fit by using the included different sized rubber attachments. It makes a difference.
Here's why these only get a 4 star from us....
We've tried both sets on two different iPhones (6 and 7) while working out. Amazingly when you try to use either of these they turn the sound down automatically. EVERYTIME!
Sometimes to zero and then mutes and sometimes to the last notch so.....using other buds we have without mics or volume and it doesn't happen.
I've scrubbed the web for any setting in iPhones that allow this.....can't find anything.
Oh one last issue.....we have a couple Roku Ultra's that you can plug headphones into the remotes to listen to TV and these sometimes make those act strange also. We're pretty sure it's the controller option on our existing buds.
Here's the thing........these are so good and valued so well that we just bought a THIRD set WITHOUT the microphone/volume/controller on the cord to see if it's that.
We have a hunch so we'll see.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After reading the reviews, these seemed like they might work for my needs. I placed them in my ears and they seemed to cancel out some of the noise, but not all, and you really have to push them into your ears in order to get that effect. When you do that, the main part of the earbud scrapes up against your ear and they feel like they are made of metal. I am not home to verify that, but that is what they feel like. It is very uncomfortable. I am thinking I might possibly have the wrong size ear piece in, but when I tried to switch them out, I was unable to get any other size on the tip of the main part. As for sound, these have good sound to them. Not sure about the super bass they claim as I don't blast music in my ears but it sounds good to me. The music isn't weak or distant sounding like some cheaper earbuds. Overall, not bad for what you pay for them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I got them before going overseas for the summer, and on the planes they did very well, blocking out crying babies and much of the engine rumble. The sound quality is excellent (not tinny at all) and the earbuds fit very comfortably in my ear.
The only fault would be that they sometimes *almost* fall out when I'm working out.
These are my second pair because I am notoriously a headphone abuser... One of the wires of the left earbud became exposed after a while, but this was the result of improper care (shoving them in my backpack, pulling my phone up by the headphones when I drop it off the bed). When the left earbud finally went out, I wasted no time in ordering another pair - and for this price, neither my wallet not my conscience hurt while doing so!

Sound quality is far and away the best out of any pair I've ever owned.  Granted, other than a pair of Beats I had years ago I usually go on the cheap when it comes to ear buds.

It's put together well enough, but since a lot of it appears to be metal, it isn't a flexible as other earbud sets. It tends to coil around itself and hold odd spring-shaped patterns until you let it twist itself out, which can be a pain to do over and over. The earbuds themselves are almost mainly metal and have a wide speaker section. This makes it harder for people like myself who have smaller ears to keep the earbuds in. Even using the smallest provided covers, the weight of the metal causes the earbuds to pull out with minimal effort. Opening my mouth, talking, or even turning my head causes them to come unseated and start to fall out. It leaves me over-cautious about how my earbuds are, which is the last thing I want when I'm walking around listening to music or a podcast.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

So I'm forced to use the uncomfortable closest size. On the holes for the speakers there is a mesh to protect stuff going into them, those little meshes fell out within a few hours. When you move around the chord a little bit towards the aux jack, the sound quality changes, and a lot of the time when you use these and walk, the audio cuts out to one of your ears every few moments. THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX! Even if they dd work 100% of the time, the audio is very tinny, and sounds pretty bad. The only thing this has going for it is that the pause & volume buttons work. Just buy the $10 Panasonic headphones, 2x the quality, isn't broken right out of the box, and is 2/3s the cost.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I looked at Jvc HAFX1X, Sony MDR-XB50AP/B , Sennheiser CX 300B and the 1More brand.  In the end, I went with Betron because of build quality, simple design, straight 3.5mm connector (no angled BS). Sure these earbuds fall a bit short on high notes (treble distorts when you pump up the volume) but it's barely noticeable to untrained ear.  By far I'm no audiophile and all I care for is a punchy bass .  These earbuds deliver with a big bang!  Just go and purchase these already!

The ear tips that earbuds came with didn't fit me well; they were either too loose or completely plugged the ears.  So I ended up using Comply T-400 tips.

For future reference, it'll be great if this headphone is sweat/water-proof. I'm not sure if it is, but that will be an added bonus (and extra safety never hurts). Also, the design of the buds are beautiful, but the cord design is kind of tacky. I paid a little bit extra to avoid the awful color combinations of the gold ear buds (if I remember properly).

After really giving them the full college try (8+ hours per day of music/media listening), I will be returning them. The wires have maintained the shape in which they were packaged, and the coating on the wires will IN NO WAY hold up long-term (the coating is that shiny, stiff plastic, and there's no way it won't split if it ever gets folded or bent). I tried all of the earbud sizes, which produced no appreciable results to the sound quality complaints above. The sharp metal edges, while stylish and giving a perception of high quality, actually have a habit of making extended-wear uncomfortable.

I've not listened to someone else talk through them on a phone call, but I had several times where I had to unplug the earbuds and use my phone's microphone due to poor sound quality being reported on the other side.

The sound quality and overall functionality is vastly inferior to the earbuds Samsung included for FREE with my Galaxy S8 years ago. I will be returning them and looking at one of the premium, mainstream brands.
***
Initial impressions aren't wowing me. Construction and quality seem top notch, but unfortunately sound quality doesn't seem to be there. They are definitely bass-boosted, and produce a full, rich sound in music where there isn't a differential in instrument sounds. Pop music sounds great in them. Unfortunately pop is not my chosen genre. Hard rock and metal sound awful in them. High noises (high-hats, snares, etc.) are extremely blaring and tinny, while the bass absolutely drowns out everything else in between. Guitar riffs and vocals are lost in the poor sound quality. When watching movies, the same is heard: any scenes with music make dialog difficult to hear, while high noises (S, T, X words, explosions, etc.) hurt your ears. They sound like the treble and bass have been cranked up to 11, and the middle has been turned to 1.

After really giving them the full college try (8+ hours per day of music/media listening), I will be returning them. The wires have maintained the condition in which they were packaged, and the coating on the wires will IN NO WAY hold up long-term (the plastic is stiff and will split over time).

They have performed well in this function, offering a blend of clear highs and strong lows, while muffling most of the surrounding chatter and clacking of keyboards. The noise isolation does leave much to be desired, but I haven't tried more expensive sets to compare and hence, don't know if noise isolation gets much better. If there is an impromptu meeting at a workstation 8 ft. away I cannot distinguish what is being said, but the murmurs are fairly audible.

I was excited to try these but yikes.

Firstly, I wouldn't consider these noise cancelling by any means-- changed the buds and that didn't help. If I can hear car horns and construction a block back way, not noise cancelling. Secondly, the sound quality is fine. Not amazing, not terrible, but seem to be a bit more dull/flat/static-y than the BS10s.

The absolute worst part is that these headphones, after about 4 days of initial use, make my Galaxy S8 go HAYWIRE. It either happens right when I plug the headphones in or randomly after 10+ minutes of usage. My volume goes up and down, buttons push all over my phone, Google assistant will randomly turn on, Spotify will start playing even if it's not turned on. My phone goes into pure demon possession mode. Not the most ideal thing when it all of a sudden decides to
BLAST THE MUSIC TO THE LOUDEST VOLUME IN UNDER A SECOND. SORRY.  COME AGAIN? I'M NOW DEAF.

I tested other headphones to plug in and they were totally fine. I've honestly never seen anything like it. I wouldn't recommend to buy for both quality of sound AND the defect.

At sub $15.00 and 66% of the ratings being 5 star, they seemed a good bet. I've purchased at least 10 low cost earbuds over the years, Sony's low-end models, the first Skull Candy offers and of course, the usually dreadful OEM smartphone sets. So I was prepared for muddled sound, no bass and distortion rather than volume. And then these smacked me upside the head. I gotta tell you that they are equal in almost every respect to my Klipsch Reference earbuds. I say almost every respect because while they sound amazing, they do not have the full range and depth of sound that the Klipsch do. Then again, they cost PBJ sandwich, not lobster.
  Now about the pictures. The bicycle accident that killed the Klipsch was mild compared to the 4 mile dragging that the Betron pair experienced as they hung out of my car door. I noticed them only when they bounced high enough to engage my peripheral vision and I immediately wrote them off and finished the drive home. Later I decided to resource the remote and plug from them and out of of curiousity I plugged them in and hit play. And they did. I can tell you that there is no way that they should have been on the end of that wire when I got home and it would be ridiculous for them to work. But they did. There is only the slightest difference in sound quality and that is probably due to the housing hanging open. The remote and all functions work as before. The only real difference is their new horrid appearance and they are kinda uncomfortable what with the flayed metal and all. I like them even better now. They are road tested.
  I don't mean to tell anyone their business but the reviews that say these earbuds have poor sound quality are unfair because it seems that the comparison is being made to other sets that have active noise cancellation and cost 10 times more. No these aren't in the range of Shure or Klipsch but there again, I didn't spend $150.00 either. You can bet that Betron will have a premium line available soon and then there will simply be no comparison.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However, these headphones are not comfortable and (even after trying all the earbuds) kept falling out of my ear.

But in searching for replacement headphones, I specifically searched this review and found another owner saying these don't tangle easily, and with my usage I don't find that to be the case. So I just want to put that out there.

These earbuds are great. They're beefy and sound good with my LG V30 which has an overdriven DAC compared to most phones. No complaints there. There are 6 sizes of earbuds included -- double the number most in-ear headphones come with -- so there's always going to be that nagging doubt, ""will the next size smaller / larger fit better?""

The volume control is high up on the cord so not exactly convenient, but it also houses the microphone for the hands-free calling, so out of necessity that's what's what. The three buttons (vol + , vol -  & pause/play/answer) and a little tiny but are in the right places, so intuitive to use.

My last headphones has a slider volume control, so I was pleased the push buttons on this one in turn adjust the phone's volume directly, which I'm sure is partly a feature of the phone, and definitely nice that I'm no longer juggling two separate volume controls.

No complaints about the hands free phone quality from the few conversations I've had while wearing these. Nobody I was speaking to commented about trouble hearing me, and from my end the call quality was just fine.

The ""wound metal"" design of the cable is not serrated for armored, it's just smooth and nicely flexible plastic with a metallic detail to it.

Overall I do wish these were a little more tangle free -- they're not bad, just not as good as the flat-cable earbuds they're replacing, and in general I'm happy with the quality and the value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-B25-Isolating-Headphones-Smartphones/product-reviews/B079GFF4HZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
