The sound is great, battery seems to last at least 1 1/2 hours but I have never run them out of battery yet.  They fit my ear good and the volume is great, even enough to hear over jet engine noise on flight.  Seems to be a good quality pair of earbuds and charging case.  I've purchased 2 pairs of the Competitors earbuds/NOT this brand and on one the charging port broke the other one earbud had half battery life and kept disconnecting.

Very happy I took a chance and bought these earbuds and enjoying using them all the time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They connected easily to multiple phones in my household and sounded good. However, they did NOT work with the iPhone 11s, which is what the teen that wanted them had.
  I posted this question on Amazon, since apparently the only mention of the issue is found in microscopic print under one picture in the description (I had to screenshot and enlarge it to see this). To my surprise, within a few days, the seller responded directly with an explanation, so bonus points for the seller. When they are updated to work with the newest iPhone, I may buy again. For now, I've returned them (which was also super easy @ Kohl's).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wasn’t expecting an AirPod experience with these, but that’s what I got. And I mean that as a compliment: I LOVE my AirPods and I wouldn’t replace them for anything in the world. But, it is nice to have a spare set of wireless earbuds to keep in your day bag or gym bag, and I can definitely say these earbuds can fill that role.

Sound quality is actually pretty good compared with the AirPods, but there is a slight difference(more on this further down) like there isn’t as much bass compared to the AirPods; This could be either a positive or negative depending on who you’re asking. But, for the most part, if you were to blind-test me just in music quality alone, I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference unless I was really paying attention.

Next thing I want to talk about is how these fit in my ears. They are noticeable larger and fit more snugly in my ear compared to the slimmer AirPods. And this is probably why I wasn’t get as much of a bass response compared to the AirPods because these earbuds seemed to not make as good a seal as the AirPods did for my ears. But that of course just comes down to my personal ear shape; Any earbud that doesn’t have adjustable  silicon tips is always something you gotta “buy it to try it” sort of deal. But on that note, if you feel that the AirPods were a bit on the small side for your ears, then these earbuds might be able to fit you better.

Button ergonomics and UX are good. The buttons are tactile and have a satisfying click to them. Single click to pause/play, long click on the left earbud to backtrack, long click on the right earbud to skip forward. It’s very intuitive and drama-free.

Pictures are attached comparing the AirPods(left) and these earbuds(right). You can really see the size differences. From a normal viewing distance, it would be really easy to ‘fool’ anyone into thinking you’re wearing actual AirPods.

If there is anything more to note through more long term usage, I’ll update my review here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

As a stand-alone unit these headsets are decent.  The sound quality is surprisingly very good.  Much better than my TWSi500 AirPod clones.  The connectivity and range is also great.  Battery life also seems good.

My biggest qualms is that it falls short on everything else compared to AirPods.

-no wireless charging case
-more round-about way if syncing then connecting
-no battery life indicator

Also an inconvenience that it uses Micro USB instead of lightning or usb C.

If you’re simply looking for something that works this is great solution.  If you’re like me and trying to go from AirPods to this it’s tough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I bought similar apple earbuds look alike in the past and they were very disappointing. They were either too big or don’t pair correctly or they break fast. This pair on the other hand was exceptional. The quality of sound is Stereo 5.0 superior quality. Making phone calls quality is great. They fit perfectly. The charging case and battery life are awesome.The earbuds tell you when the connect or loose the connection! The sound quality is very, very good. The ear buds seem to last quite awhile on a charge. I have yet to run them down in a single session. The volume is loud enough to hear while cycling on my indoor trainer which is very much appreciated! I had to wear ear muffs over my old ones to be able to hear audio while riding. No way to adjust volume from the buds, but I can deal with that. I like that they can be used individually. I forgot the left one was the Master and turned the right one off. The left one continued to operate. That is actually pretty cool. I was even able to turn the right one back on. Upon receiving, I noticed just how nicely packed they were and how cute the little charging case is, which is small and can fit in my pocket without looking bulky. They're easy to set up after reading the user manual, which I recommend, so I could figure out how to change songs, pause, or go back to a previous song. I haven't received any calls while using these, so I can't say how well the Bluetooth works for that, but I have high expectations. The sound quality is amazing and blocks out outside noises, which is great but also dangerous if you're outside and can't hear cars coming by, so definitely make sure you're paying attention to your surroundings. Overall, I'm really impressed with these earbuds and highly recommend these if you're looking for cheaper headphones without paying Apple's prices!!More importantly, it’s the looks. It’s simple and neat, unlike other true wireless products with complicated designs on the box and the earbud. This pair of earbud is suitable for any circumstance. Plus on the charger of the earbud which is the case shows the battery status of the earbuds. I compared with many other sellers, they actually don’t have this feature on their products. The connection for these earbuds is surprisingly simple. They connect automatically when I pool them out once the first-time connection is done. Overall I highly recommend these earbuds. It’s really a good deal!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was only looking for something which would have decent sound quality and reasonable isolation, and something which would have better battery life. These were on sale, so I decided to give them a try.
Not only do these fit incredibly comfortably, but the sound quality is very good. There's a tiny amount of background hiss (as is typical for actively powered headphones) but it's low enough that it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the music, and it does serve a purpose in letting me know they're turned on.
The little charging/carrying case is nicely designed. It has enough battery to charge the earbuds 4 times, and it also itself can be charged wirelessly or via USB.

they stayed in just fine, and sound decent. listened for about an hour and they still had quite a bit of battery left.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The earbuds looks very similar to Apple AirPods.  Compare to AirPods, This charging case is slightly larger in all dimensions but rounder and puffier.  Its ear pods are also overall slightly larger, and the shape somewhat similar to AirPods but not identical.  It looks and feels good, and the mechanism is great, too.

Sound Qualified wise:
This earbud is easy to operate like most other wireless earphones, but it produces better stereo and microphone results than many others.

When compare to regular Apple EarPods, Thr earbuds sounds just as good.  However, its microphone transmitting quality and clarity are a little beneath regular EarPods’.  Which is understandable, due to the microphone location is much higher up then EarPods’.

Use time:
These rwrbuds performed a solid 4 hours of play time before they signaled a battery charging reminder through voice notification.

On the other hand, The charing case charges quickly.  It takes no mare then 2 hours to fully juice up.

Downside:
There is one tiny downside for these earbuds — When more then one device has been connected to it and both are in range, user needs to first disconnect from the previous device in order to connect to the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Dailey","Nope.","November 20, 2019","I bought these after my Airpods were stolen out of my car last week. I figured they'd do the trick for a few months until I could get new Airpods. As soon as I unboxed them, I could tell the quality was so bad compared to Apple. I can tell you now, the only similarities between the two products is the shape of the case and earbuds themselves. The charging case feels very lightweight and cheap. I read the manual, and throughout the booklet, it references the ""master"" earpod, which is defaulted to the left piece. So I spent 10 minutes trying to get them to turn on and pair only to realize that my master earpod is actually the right one. Maybe something is wrong, or they changed the product and didn't update the directions. Once I charged them and was able to get them to pair, the left earpod would not turn on. Even after resetting them and going through the pairing process again, the left one will not work.

The feature I loved about Apple Airpods is the tapping capabilities that you can customize to support whatever command you want for each earbud. For example, I can decide if I want the left to pause my song, change the song, activate Siri, etc. and the same goes for the right. I thought this one would have a similar set up. On this brand, both have buttons on the earpod, and the directions just list the capabilities, but doesn't provide any instructions or clarification on which feature applies to which earbud. Considering I cannot even get the left one to work, I don't know if I'll even be able to figure out which purpose it serves.

I realize this is a Chinese product and I'm sure the English version of the manual is a rough translation of the Chinese directions on the back. However, some of my directions don't even make sense. For example, one section tells me that when the headphones are fully charged, the orange light on the case will turn off. In the section below that, it states the light will remain lit when they're fully charged. Apple Airpods have an pop-up window that appears on your screen indicating the battery life of your case, along with each individual earbud. Now I am just taking a guess as to whether or not this version is fully charged.

Definitely will be returning and buying new Airpods on Black Friday. This may be a great product for someone who has never had Airpods before, but in my opinion, the two just do not compare.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Obviously most people will be comparing these to AirPods and since those are so widely owned I included a couple of pictures comparing them visually (AirPods on the right, Rademax are on the left). I was pretty hesitant about getting this style headphone until my wife got some AirPods and I found out why everybody is raving about wireless headphones like this! They are so quick, easy to use, comfortable, and just so dang convenient. So if you are like me and didn’t understand all the hype around wireless earbud headphones I suggest you try some out for yourself.
Now some helpful notes about these in particular, they fit in the ear slightly larger than AirPods so you need to know that. It wasn’t a problem for me and actually it creates a pretty snug fit. I tried head banging with them to test how secure they are and they didn’t budge! However my wife has small ears and these would not stay in for her. So I do not recommend these for people with small ears.
The sound quality is exactly what I hoped for. I’d say a bit better than most stock headphones that come with a phone. I didn’t throw these in expecting Bose or Beats over the ear style sound, I bought these for the convenience and ease of use and as long as the sound is better than average I’m a very satisfied customer, which I’m happy to say is the case for these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

My wife and I own three pairs of wireless earphones between us. This pair by far has the best sound quality. The battery life is the lowest of the three but the carrying case also serves as a charger for some extra juice in between charges. The shape of the earphones is very similar to the earphones that come with new iPhones.

I was a little nervous being that there are no extra silicone pieces to find the right fit- and I have smaller ears and so I have found a lot of earbuds uncomfortable in the past.  What I like is there is no silicone piece as those get lost in my house constantly. (I am not sure if it is the kids or they just fall off). It is nice to know I won’t have to worry about losing a piece to make it fit comfortably.  They come in a nice small charging case so you can charge them while you are on the go.

The earbud, when playing music, last anywhere from 3-4.5 hours before they need a charge. When you put them in your ear you can not feel that they are there. They are very comfortable and they stay put. My one issue is the left earbud would die 15min faster than the right earbud How I fix this problem is I press and hold the multifunctional key on both earbuds right before I charge them- you will hear them say ""power off"". I also make sure to plug the usb in the wall even though they can charge directly from the case. I charge then though the case with out USB if I am out. I also put the earbuds in the charging case together so they charge and drain at the same speed.

I have used many earbuds before, galaxy earbuds, airpods, jabra elite. Among them the best sounding microphone was airpods, although I would not praise its audio quality. I was looking into some cheaper bluetooth earbuds and want to see if the high price of previous mentioned earbuds are necessary? So I came by this earbud and honestly I had my doubts even before I got to try them out. I thought, for such a price, how good can it be. However, the sound was amazing, I would not say that its on the bass side of the spectrum, but the mid and the highs are clear. I made many phone calls and out of 10 people 8 people said they can understand my words with no problem. The other two mentioned that they can understand me fine, but they sometimes had to use context clues to put them all together. I say that this earbud for its price is a great LIGHT earbud and a great choice for those wanting a quality sounding earbuds. The only problem that I had with this is that the connector is MICRO USB... I mean I can live with it but its just another wire to carry along with me. LETS GO USB C PLEASE!!

Overall I enjoy using these earbuds for its quality sound for music and me having confidence that people will understand fir sure during phone calls.

And because of this it becomes very convenient to use for longer time.
I have several point of view on which this product 's over all rating is phenomenal. My list starts as below.

1. Latest BT-5.0 tech : which enables it to pair/connect instantaneously with targeted device, It has superior connectivity range. I keep on switching this buds whenever needing between my mobile and laptop( both has BT5.0), it works seemlessly-awesome.
2. Battery : This product has best thing happen with BT headsets in last couple of years, even though it has smaller life cycle - the carrying case becomes its battery backup, I usually uses this product for 2-3 hrs at straight and once I am done, just have to put it in its box, boom- battery start recharging again.
3. Look & Feel : It is nice slick product design, and ear buds fits way better than i have expected.
4. Sound : I would say this has great sound with best stereo who wants to watch videos and listen music on the go, why working out etc.,
5. Built in Mic :  I wont recommend this for long call or join audio meeting cause some of my friend has ask me to change my headsets number of times during call because there is constant drop in sound/ constant disturbance , I think this is the only drawback of this product.
6. Price point : Good price point for this product, best fit to my need and my usage.

I think they have also included 18 M warranty, so if something happens down the line with product we should good to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

First thing I noticed was it is made of really high qualify plastic. It didn't feel ""cheap"" at all. Second, the earbuds paired immediately as I opened the case! No lag in Bluetooth connection whatsoever. The earbuds themselves are pretty substantial compared to Apple earbuds but they fit my ears snuggly. If you have smaller ears these might be kind of big. I personally find Airpods and Apple earbuds a little small for my ears. I like the sound quality a lot, I don't notice much of a difference between these and my regular Apple buds. I like using these especially for phone calls because it makes moving around the house and taking calls VERY easy, with both buds in or just one.

However, I need to be able to take phone calls on these. This is a major feature I'm looking for and honestly the quality of the microphones on these is so bad they should have just left them off. For testing I called a couple friends who said they could barely hear me and that only some of my words came through. I had my wife put them on and call me with them and I confirmed they don't pick up everything that's being said. I read the user manual that comes in the box hoping I could adjust their sensitivity perhaps, but the manual only offers a method to reset back to factory settings.

I can't compare the sound quality with the original ones, but I can't say anything bad about it, all my songs sound good to me. I use them to go running, since I find wires going from my ears to my pocket are very annoying and I always accidentally pull them out, or they would get strangled up in my long hair or something. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once your ears are used to them you can barely feel them!

They fit perfectly and don't fall out. The sound quality is decent and they can be turned up very loud. Pairing with my phone was quick and easy, though the minimal instruction manual is poorly written.

My favorite part is the case. When you open it and take the earbuds out, they automatically turn on and connect to my phone. When you put them in the case, they snap in magnetically. When you close the lid the disconnect from the phone.

I haven't yet had any problems that I've had with previous wireless earbuds such as random disconnects or one bud stopping working.

W.","Good build quality, comfortable, good audio quality, and easy pairing","July 18, 2019","The T12 comes in a very nice packaging. It has a very nice carrying case that feels premium. It is a little bit bulkier than what I would have liked but it is packed with 500mAh of battery that is capable of charging the earbuds multiple times. Personally, I would not mind to have slightly smaller battery so it would make a lighter and more portable case and have a bigger battery in the earbud. So, I can use it longer than the 3.5 hours of playback time before have to recharge it.

The earbud feels well-built. It does not scream premium but does not feel cheap either. Its shape fits well in my ear and does not fall out even during light movement. It is fairly comfortable wearing it for a long period.

Pairing the device is quite easy. Re-pairing the unit is equally easy as well. I am not a huge fan that the unit stayed on for about 10 minutes after it is disconnected. While this allows the device waiting to be paired again or with another device, I just prefer to have it auto-shut off at sooner to save battery. I did encounter a couple of instances where only 1 earbud is paired to my phone and I had to turn it off and re-establish the pairing. It’s a rare event that seems to only happens when the pairing is establish with the earbud already out of the case and not when I took it out of the case (as that automatically power both earbud and establish the pairing mode).

I feel that sound quality on the T12 is very good.  The volume level is not as loud as some other headsets I have used and thus, I had to crank up the volume a tad higher. However, the earbud sounded rounded and balanced. The audio is clear and crisp. It does lack a bit of bass but I do appreciate the balanced sound.

When comes to making calls, I can hear the sound clear though I did have a few instances where the receiving end reports that the audio does not sound clear or is a bit laggy.
Disconnect the BT and re-establish the connection seems to fix the issue.

Speaking of the Bluetooth, I do feel that the BT range is not as far as some other Bluetooth.
I am also not a big fan of the hardware control as it requires you to press a button into your ear which is a bit uncomfortable. This is especially difficult when comes to double tap to skip tracks.

Couple minor things, I wish the unit can be charged with USB-C. Also, the manual seems to mixed up left and right earbud label (since the right side is the main earbud but it is labelled left side) and the text is just awfully small.

Overall, I am pretty happy with the purchase especially the sound quality. Since I use the headphone primarily for listening to music and watching movie and not as much as making calls, I enjoy using it. For its price, it offers good sound and I only wish it has longer battery life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I decided to purchase these after seeing all the positive reviews. I was not disappointed! They do get quite loud. Enough that I cannot hear any of the wind or dogs barking. They do cancel out quite a bit of noise but I wouldn't say they are like a set of Bose noise cancelling headphones. Don't expect pure silence. They were easy to connect to my phone and came mostly charged. I like that the container snuggly holds the ear pieces and charges them so I don't have to worry about them going missing or run out of battery.

I really love these! I was worried about buying these since a lot of other Bluetooth earbuds didn’t seem so good. But I’ve been very surprised.

The charging case is very nice, as well as the earbuds themselves. I personally think the sound is great, and they’re very light!

They were also extremely easy to pair! I was very surprised, and they pair automatically upon pulling them out of the charging case.

My one grievance is that my ears are very small, so they have a habit of falling out. I was out in my daily life for about an hour, and during that time they fell out 3 times, one at a time. I’m not sure what to do about that, but it’s nothing major for me.

I’m really glad these are good, because I really didn’t want to pay for AirPods.

Everyone knows exactly what brand of earbud they look like and while wearing them everyone said, oh sweet you got air pods. How do you like them? Then of course when I shared with them what they were and the price they became even more intrigued.  The price and quality of these are absolutely amazing and I've already just within a week had friends order them after trying them out.
The casing is spot on and has a great feel. Just clean and simple just like the original. A big thing for me after testing many earbuds is how easy are they to get in and out of the case as some of them can be a little bit of a pain, when it should be super quick and easy. These slide in and out perfectly without any issue.
One of the nice things about these verse many others on the market is that they have the same shape and style as the air pods which is perfect for those that don't like the earbuds that go deep into the ear canal. I know many friends that complain about those types over time causing pain or discomfort to their ears, so these are fantastic for those that don't like that style of earbud.
Ultimately the sound quality is one of the most important features and now after using them for 1 week to give proper burn in and testing them against actual air pods (my wife owns a pair), these are a fantastic bang for the buck! The sound is very well balanced and I can wear them for hours without any discomfort whatsoever. They are the most comfortable earbuds I've tested to date.
If you are wanting all the features and technologies of air pods at less than a 1/3 of the price these are it. I will be buying more of these for Christmas gifts!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Not much more than that though.","October 5, 2019","If these really are fairly comparable to the Apple version that costs about a franklin more, then I’m glad I didn’t spend that kind of money.  I noticed a lot of people at work walking around with these in their ears.  I wasn’t sure if they were mostly listening to music or podcasts or just ready for an inbound phone call or a teleconference.  So I got this (relatively) inexpensive close.  They fall out fairly frequently (almost fell into a toilet).  And listening to music—they have almost no bass.  I’m not really surprised as the only type of earbuds that ever had great bass response had foam seals and I pushed in to seal them.  This kept the bass response good, but also made it difficult to hear outside sounds.  It probably had a higher risk of hearing damage if the volume was too high.  I don’t think you need too worry about that with these earbuds.  They just don’t stay in very well and ergo don’t sound all that great on the low end.  I can’t imagine why some of the reviewers said they had good bass response.  I respectfully disagree.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The case is nice and also borrows from the Airpod aesthetic, which is a good thing. It has a nice snap to it when you close it and seems to be pretty sturdy. The gloss of the case just makes it look a lot more pleasing. The case can charge the earbuds A LOT. I'm not sure exactly how much, but the case holds 500mah, and the earbuds have 30mah, so at least 8 times for the pair, and the buds last about 3hrs.

Like I said though, these are not airpods and other than the aesthetic, it's very easy to tell them apart from airpods. The ends of these are more blocky and have sharp contours as opposed to the roundness of airpods. They are also charged via micro-usb, which is a dead giveaway. They also have physical quick buttons that you can use to pause/play/pick up/end/reject calls that stand out.

The sound quality of these is really good! It's really clear when listening to music and I haven't had any issues with talking on the phone either. However, I would like to point out that (just like airpods), these don't have sound isolation. That's the trade up. You're giving that up for convenience of being able to drop them in your ear.

Connectivity is really good too. You just open the case and by the time it's in your ear, it's already connected. It disconnects after you close the case. It works in solo mode too (only using one), however you lose some functionality of the buttons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Reamer","These Earbuds Work Great!","October 13, 2019","The packaging was very good.  Very similar to Apple packaging.  I charged the earbuds fully, while I read the instruction book let.  The instructions are straightforward with only a couple of grammar errors.  Once charged, I paired the buds to my MacBook.  Pairing was simple, as stated in the instructions.  The best part is you don't have to learn what certain beeps mean!  The earbuds tell you when the connect or loose the connection!  The sound quality is very, very good.  The ear buds seem to last quite awhile on a charge.  I have yet to run them down in a single session.  The volume is loud enough to hear while cycling on my indoor trainer which is very much appreciated!  I had to wear ear muffs over my old ones to be able to hear audio while riding.  No way to adjust volume from the buds, but I can deal with that.  I like that they can be used individually.  I forgot the left one was the Master and turned the right one off.  The left one continued to operate.  That is actually pretty cool.  I was even able to turn the right one back on.  I like the flexibility of being able to use one, or both.  The case / charger is pretty cool.  The charging light sequences as described in the manual is helpful, but will take awhile to get used to. The important thing to remember is that constant orange is fully charged.  The earbuds are magnetically pulled into the case.  They start coming back to life when you open the case, and usually connect to the MacBook shortly after I get the first one in my ear.  They are comfortable in my ears.  They stay in during indoor bike rides as well as kettlebell / bodyweight workouts!  No annoying wires to deal with.

•Easy fit in the ears,
•Easy pairing,
•Pairs right away after you remove them from the case.
•Charge lasts for a while
•Charging case
•You can activate Siri by pressing one of the buttons on it.

CONS:
•NOT good for calls, other person can’t hear you and you hear them pretty bad.
•Is not touch enabled , it has a button on each one, to skip the song and other functions.
•You can not adjust the volume on the EarPods, therefore you have to do that on you phone, which I thought it was a bummer.
•Somehow when you’re listening to music, it gets interference like it seems like the music is gonna stop or skip, scrambling the sound, which is kinda of annoying.

Overall for like a third of the price of the real one, it is not so bad and from the cons listed, the ones that annoys me the most are the calls and the volume (which you can do on your Apple Watch if you use one).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

You can skip songs, go back, answer calls by just pressing the button on the earbuds. I have large ears so earbuds usually don't fit me very well, but I've had these several days and they actually fit very snugly for me, which is a big plus. They fit back into a carrying case that also charges them. If you're someone who tends to lose these things, since they're so small, it doesn't make much sense to spend $200 on Apple products when these are just as good in my opinion, and a fraction of the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I pair these to my iPhone 6s.

Pros: the sound quality is good and has nice bass for buds without silicon cups. They don’t cancel noise because they are not noise cancelling designed headphones (active or passive). Battery seems solid and the fit and finish are good. Pairing is fast. Comfortable.

Cons: you can’t use them to talk on the phone. When I’m on calls people can’t hear me, or it’s choppy. Basically you can’t rely on the microphone to make calls reliably. I expect the apple Bluetooth secret sauce for their brand earbuds make their brand of equipment more reliable for talking on the phone (I don’t see people with apple AirPods saying “can you hear me now?”). But these simply don’t work for phone calls. I’m that guy saying “can you hear me now” and then just stick the phone up to my ear.

They are good for listening to music, though sometimes will buzz or click as it loses signal briefly. Overall a good pair to use for exercising or listening to music because of the price, but not useful for replacing your wired headset for making phone calls.

The old adage prevails: you get what you pay for. This ain’t an AirPod 1:1 replacement.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound quality is okay (not like iPods) and it works for calls. However, it also happens that once in a while the sound stops or pauses for like 2-3 seconds.

I took a chance and ordered these based off the reviews, price and quality of the product and it’s features.
When I received them I opened the box and right away I was very impressed with the quality of the build and how the wireless earbuds were packaged.
They came with everything listed in the item description on Amazon. I took them out of their charger case and they immediately went into pairing mode. I was very impressed with the speed of which these wireless earbuds paired to my iPhone.
More impressive is the quality of the sound they have. Music is very clear and I was able to go from soft to very loud without distortion. You can be heard clearly when you are on them. They are lite weight and you hardly know you have them on.
If you are in the market for a new set of wireless earbuds and ones that are very well made, I highly recommend them to you.

Thinking of returning the unit as this is BIG LET DOWN and seller is not true to what they advertise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The packaging was incredible, the quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality sound and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features this earbud have to offer.

Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose T10, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the  chargeable case is very handy. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The material used is really good as well as the earbuds don’t seem cheap or third-rated.
The sound quality is surprisingly good. Gets really loud but doesn’t distort the music in any shape or form.

Pairing: super easy, literally just one click on phone.
Sound: The sound is well balanced, and is very clear even at high volumes. The mid and highs are recreated well. Overall, I love the output and there isn't any lag between the earphones.
Charge/Power: It seems to be getting the advertised 5-6 hours of runtime and the charger is quick.
Microphone: Phone calls are good if not a little faint.
Fit and Finish: the case and the build quality of the headphones is great! No gap in the case. The magnets hold the headphones into the case securely. The case is really nice and small, easy to put anywhere.
Sport/Waterproof: I have tested this twice on 5k run, the buds stayed there very nicely the whole time.
This pair has fast become one of my favorites. They look like the AirPods in appearance, but are several notches lower in price. The product is well documented, and the quick start guide is mostly all you need. Can’t say anything bad!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Sound quality was surprisingly good compared to other wireless earbuds at this around this price, and pairing is super quick after opening the case (I have a Galaxy S10+).

I'm a small person and the buds themselves were a bit large, but didnt cause too much discomfort. Though I did feel fatigue after wearing them for more than an hour, so thats something to note. During the 1-2 hours I would wear them for, I did notice them getting uncomfortably warm in my ears.

But, since getting them, I havent needed to charge them. I used them for maybe 4 hours per day since I've gotten them and havent needed to charge the case yet, so battery life is pretty good.

Having the physical buttons however does feel pretty clunky, and weird especially hearing the click in your ears when you press it (it also presses into your ear more when you so this).

As for the case, it feels pretty heavy and well made. I own the i10ws as well, and the quality compared to that is far better. The hinge does worry me as it feels a bit loose, but overall, its pretty good and I wouldnt worry about it breaking unless I smacked the top part of the case with a good amount of force.

TLDR; Good for the price. Build quality is great. Not good for people with smaller ear openings. Quick pairing.

Pros:
- Small & easy to carry around
- Good battery life
- Good sound (bass is more prominent than the treble though, mids seem kind of drowned out, but can easily be fixed with an equalizer)
- Decent case build.

Cons:
- Gets worryingly warm after about an hour of use.
- Buds on the larger side. Causes fatigue after wearing them for a while.
- Buttons require a decent amount of force to press (causing discomfort) but function as advertised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These also are not fitted like the AirPods, so they may not fit as well or snug. But despite these ""issues,"" these earbuds are still a good deal at the price they are at.

It paired flawlessly with my iPhone 7. Sound was surprisingly excellent.  Just a tip on pairing - go to settings menu and bluetooth. T12 is discovered and click to pair. This is different for users of Apple brand earbuds as it is discovered on your home screen and you don't need to go to the settings menu. Not sure about pairing with new iPhone 11. Suggest you ask the seller if it compatible. I have seen comments on other wireless earbuds stating not compatible with iPhone 11 due to the new chip Apple uses in these iPhones.
Fits well in both ears. It had a Transparency code on the box that verified my ear buds with the manufactured specs and authenticity.

The apple airpods were nice but they cost nearly $200.  I decided to give these a try since it was a fraction of the price, and it has been amazing! Pairing with the phone was very instant and easy and It connects to the phone right away.  Sound quality is great; I can hear my wife very clearly when I drive and she can hear me without a lot of outside noises.  Battery life is good about 6-7 hrs.  It is lightweight and comes in a similar box as the airpods, which makes it easy to carry around.  It comes with its instructions on how to receive and ignore the call from the earbud itself as well.  If you are looking for a good set of earbuds but don't want to overpay, get these earbuds for similar quality but for a lot lot less!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Sound quality is surprisingly good and these are actually the most comfortable. My others have the rubber ear pieces but these just hard plastic and are actually more comfortable in my ear. Real buttons to pause/play is a huge plus, some of my others have touch controls which I accidentally hit when I adjust them.

It's a very good balanced sound and it is clear enough to hear any imperfections in our digital music. I'm a music guy, so sound quality is important to me. I gave it a 5/5 stars but temper your expectations. I found it to have more than enough bass, and mids and highs were crisp and detailed. I gave it 5/5 as I'm comparing it against other wireless bluetooth earbuds.
 It also cancels noise because it plugs your ear canal. That's it. These should even have a noise cancellation rating as I think that should be reserved strictly for Active Noise Cancellation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are really nice and portable earpod imitations of other more expensive pods but with high quality audio. They are a comfortable fit in the ear and the battery life lasts a long time. You charge them through the carrying case and it's all magnetic so you won't lose them. They automatically power off in the case so the charge lasts a long time.

They're very simple to use and connect to via bluetooth. I was surprised by the built in microphone which worked really well on a call I used them for. The multifunction can answer calls, end calls, and reject calls and it switches right back to music when the call is over. If you have an Apple device, you can activate Siri using the multifunction button so they're just like the name brand ones. The hardest part is memorizing the functions of the multifunction button.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Not a good buy. feel I've wasted my money.

I am updating my experience by one star for now.  After my unhappy post, the seller reached out to me and offered a replacement set of earphones of a different type.  I thought this was a very good gesture and shows a sincere desire to have satisfied and happy customers.  I am indeed appreciative of this gesture.  I now await the arrival of the new earphones to see if the quality of the product improves.  Stay tuned.

So.. I received a complimentary pair of conoco earbuds, to replace the pair I was unhappy with. The new pair is much better both in design and sound quality. Sound quality is excellent both for music and conversations.

I have tried ones with the soft tips but they usually slip out of my ears, even trying all the tip sizes. These partial-in-ear earbuds fit comfortably and more importantly, did not fall out when I jumped up and down and went about my day. The sound quality is pretty good though I have not tried to listen to music in a loud/busy environment yet. One slightly inconvenient point is the lack of volume control on the earbuds themselves -- I would need to adjust the volume from my phone/computer, etc. Pairing to my Android phone required a minute or two for the earbuds to be detected and upon first detection, the volume is at maximum so make sure to not have the earbuds in your ears when you pair them for the first time to a device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Here are my thoughts regarding the whole product as a whole :

SIZE/FIT : These earpods fit perfectly in my ear, and due to the matte finish it has an awesome grip to it. The case is the correct size and it feels robust. Without sacrificing the size, it packed a lot of battery.

BATTERY LIFE : I can easily go on continuously listening to songs for 2 days straight. Obviously though it is slow charging of my google pixel xl. But it helps as you don't have carry any extra power bank with you.

SOUND QUALITY : As I mentioned in my headline, this earpod is mostly awesome for its bass. It packs a punch and the sound quality is through the roof (as per the money paid).

CONNECTIVITY : Bluetooth range is about 5-10 meters and it is really easy to connect to my android device. It also shows the charger percentage beside the connected earpod (like an airpod shows for apple devices).

COMFORT : I like these earbuds fit flush into my ears unlike other outward-looking earbuds. It fits snugly with the standard rubber buds, and I can barely feel they are on my ears after 30 minutes. I have a problem that I can't wear over the ear headphones, there are a perfect choice for me since it doesn't make my ears hot or red after a while.

Overall I think it is a great value for money even though it might look as if $45 is too much. Worth it, 100%.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've always used the old fashion wired ones, but I get tired of them since always do running, the wire always dangles and gets unplugged. So I came across these on Amazon! I mean for the price we're paying, way more affordable than Airpods. Sound quality isn't bad either. I did like how fast the customer service was when I told them the first one they sent me had a defect on it and they got back to me instantly. One thing I like and notice about these are when you remove one of the earbuds, the other one still plays. I know when you do this for Airpods, the other earbud still in your ear instantly stops playing music.

Sound quality was decent, but not nearly as rich or full-bodied as my apple corded ear buds.
there is no volume control on the buds, it must be done on the device.  kind of a nuisance really.  if my phone is pocketed, and i want to change the volume, i have to pull the phone from the pocket - that defeats the purpose of being hands-free.
also, the body is a little larger than the apple version resulting in a fit not quite as good as the apple.
what's more, there is no device memory on these buds.  each time you change devices you must re-pair the buds to the device.  these buds do not remember all of the devices to which they were paired, only the last one, which is another defeat of the wireless idea.
another downside is the fact they provided all kinds of static on my macbook, but not on my iPhone.  don't understand that.
so, with all the less-than-ideal characteristics of these buds, i returned mine.  too bad too, i really wanted to use these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These fashion a similar look to the AirPods with the addition of a physical button. Some people love, and some people hate it, I actually like it because you won’t accidentally hit a physical button as much as you would a touch sensitive one. They’re sturdy, higher quality plastic, and a strong magnet connection to the charging case.

The charging case provides hours of continuous playback, and the only drawback I had with these earbuds is occasionally trying to get them out. The magnet is strong.

Performance: 4/5
No issues connecting to my phone and MacBook. Very easy to do, and have 0 connection issues. I’ve been able to walk around through the majority of my house without losing connection (roughly 15-25ft range).

Overall Sound: 4/5
Sound is pretty good for this price level. Most TWS at this price point can have a cheap, can like sound but these have a full bass, wide mids, and clear highs.

Mic overall is pretty good, I work in an loud environment and these held up fine. They’re not most incredible for the mic as they don’t cancel out the noise, but they are usable and work in most environments.

Overall Review: 4/5
These are really good for the price, quality, and sound. They’re definitely not cheap, and they are well suited where they are.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

But that's a good thing, when they're designed this well! The audio isn't fantastic, but it's great for audiobooks and podcasts, or casual music listening. I especially appreciated the compact form factor and secure magnet in the lid.

One thing that makes these ""better than"" AirPods is that you can use them well with Android, cycling each side out of the charging case. They connect and disconnect securely, without any lag. Of course, the best feature is the price: you can use these without anxiety, since they are a fraction of the cost of the Apple version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

So here we go...

I'm a runner, so I'm always looking for new headphones that are comfortable and durable that get me through my miles for the day. I don't like the wires on my Apple headphones because I've been known to pull the wire directly out of my ears or phone and have to stop my run to fix it. I've always wanted Apple AirPods but didn't want to pay the price for these dainty, little headphones, so I took my search to Amazon to see what they offered. I did extensive research, read reviews, and by luck I stumbled upon these wireless pods. I bought these in anticipation for my next 5k, which was 2 days away from when I ordered these (thank you next day delivery!) and I was excited to use them.

Upon receiving, I noticed just how nicely packed they were and how cute the little charging case is, which is small and can fit in my pocket without looking bulky. They're easy to set up after reading the user manual, which I recommend, so I could figure out how to change songs, pause, or go back to a previous song. I haven't received any calls while using these, so I can't say how well the Bluetooth works for that, but I have high expectations. The sound quality is amazing and blocks out outside noises, which is great but also dangerous if you're outside and can't hear cars coming by, so definitely make sure you're paying attention to your surroundings. Overall, I'm really impressed with these earbuds and highly recommend these if you're looking for cheaper headphones without paying Apple's prices!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Great deal and amazing quality at any price.","November 13, 2019","Great Bluetooth earbuds all around. Sound quality is often sacrificed in cheaper products but not this one. The sound quality is equal to the wired headphones. They sync and pair effortlessly and have a nice 30’ range.  They auto sync to the last device paired so just take the buds out of the charging case and they are paired by the time they are in your ears.  The battery life is about 3 hrs as advertised. They charge in about 1 hour. The case charges the buds about 4- 5 times between case charge.  Heck of a deal here.

I'm quite impressed with these in terms of apple-like functionality and sound.  No other fakePods I own (probably 8) pair as fast these.  It's on par with the real AirPods.  The sound is also not bad either.  I would compare it simliar to AirPods 1 sound, which is a good thing because I can't stand the heavy bass on my AirPods 2.

Also to note, these are a smidge larger than real AirPods.  Just by a hair.

I have small ear canals & most buds make them sore, but these are quite different.
My only wish is that the volume was higher. Your phone controls the volume & mine is nearly maxed out. I've noticed that with any of the recent wireless buds I've bought. That said the volume is good.
Noise cancellation isn't maxes, but the music is able to br heard without pushing them deep in my ears. These are way better than any other wireless product I've bought. I think I've finally landed on a keeper!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Bluetoooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/product-reviews/B07S93YL9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
