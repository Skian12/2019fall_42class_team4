The highs aren't being left out and in general the audio quality is awesome.
The build is very good. sturdy headphones, with great sound isolation. Distortion is very low on high levels of volume but listening for too long too loud will become uncomfortable quite fast as the drivers are quite powerful and don't require you to have a full on volume on your phone or player to really enjoy really high quality sound. Headphones are bit bigger than your 5$ generic headphones but you will get used to it. The silicone isolation is very good and holds in your ears well. Personally I ride a scooter daily, and the headphones need to be pressed into my ear sometimes uncomfortably when I put on my helmet so they won't clip and fall off due to the bit bulky outer shell design, so its not THE best for riders BUT I do enjoy the supreme music. Another danger is that you can barely hear your surroundings because the isolation is so good. With the headphones comes a handy pouch for carrying them whenever, so you can safely store them in a safe place and prolong their life by minimizing the risk of wear and tear. Overall the cable is sturdy and feels great, and as a bonus its hard to tangle itself, especially if you carry them with the pouch. The microphone on the earphones is of superior quality and is crystal clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'm not any kind of expert on audio, so this review is just from some guy who needed new earphones :P

Again, let me say that these earphones sound great! I already knew the bass was going to sound good from reading/watching reviews, and they did not disappoint. As soon as I put them on, I went to Youtube to listen to those bass test videos, and the bass was smooth and clear even with the volume way up. But what impressed me more was how clear they sound overall. I'm comparing these to the only other earphones I have, which are the Skullcandy Ink'd 2. After listening to the Sonys for about half an hour, I decided to listen to the Skullcandys for comparison, and man, they sounded muddy and the bass was just ugly. This was a huge improvement.

They look good. I got the blue ones. Normally I prefer red over blue, but this design looks better in blue IMO. Just personal preference, all 3 colors look niceee ;)

Couldn't think of any cons.

Accidentally stepping on the Skullcandys and breaking the control thingy was a blessing in disguise lol(they still work fine with a little tape, I'll give them that). I'm glad I got these, and I think you will be, too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I can't really add anything more to what the chorus of users have already posted.  Love the sound, love the bass -- no other buds even come close unless you jam them into your ear canal which isn't particularly comfortable.

I also have found that the silicon buds themselves just happen to fit my ears perfectly.  I am using the largest diameter buds and unlike any other hearbuds I've tried, these ones just seem to hold the device perfectly so that not only is the sound good but wearing them is comfortable and secure.  I wear them on my 20min work outs on a rowing machine and other gym equipment and have never had them fall out.  Amazing.

The ONLY drawback is that there isn't volume control -- the button either turns off/on music but you can't control volume.  Normally, I'd deduct a star or 1/2 star for that, but these earbuds are some exceptional that I let it slide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I am liking these head phones and they are groeing on me. I bought these at best buy because they looked good. If someone found it on the street they could tell just by looking that they are not cheap buds. Also because I go jogging and the curve looked like something that would not easily fall out. I was right and the head phones do not feel loose or like they would fall out. Also the mic works better than some Philips head phones I had returned. I loved the Philips but they felt loose in my ears and not great for running. I would say if your looking for head phones that fit well in your ears and sound..decent then this is good. Especially if you like a lot of base then its a no brained. I do suggest getting an app like power amp...anything with snd equalizer to enhance the head phones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_80?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=80&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'd say my only knock on these is the cord is maybe 6"" too short for me - I usually put my phone on the workout machines at the gym and the cable is a bit short.  They supposedly have some app for Android to customize the use of the single button on the left cable, but there is no app for iOS.  That's ok, the button works fine if you read the instructions.

I haven't used them for a phone call yet, but I like the mic being in the earpiece itself rather than down on the cable.  I'm hoping this will work better than some that have the mic on the cable, which doesn't pick up sounds well.

They are a bit more difficult to get into my ears than just popping them in, but due to that they fit well and block a lot of external sound, and they don't pop out of your ears if you move around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Not as amazing as everyone seems to be implying though in my opinion. The earbuds fit comfortably in my ears, but tend to fall out rather easily when being used at the gym. I think I will make these my travel headphones and go back to using my Sennheisers for working out.

A negative about these above certain others, is they have a VERY limited warranty. Only a couple months. I expect them to last a while, but other companies with comparable sound offer 1-2 year warranties if they stop working. If used heavily, something is bound to happen.

So yes, for the price point these have truly great sound, with crisp highs and great balance.

As for the Bass, it wasn't sigfnicantlly better than the RPHJE120 either.

If you are deciding between the XB90EX and the XB50AP just get the XB90! It does cost $40 more, but you get a much richer bass with a VERY clear and accurate mids and highs.

The Mids and Highs for the XB90EX have no foggy noise, it is sharp, and stands out. I'd recommend the XB90EX if you are looking for a rich bass, or the Panasonic RPHJE120 otherwise.

But don't think that the upper range is neglected, because the sound is clear and strong throughout. I used to always get Sony earbuds in high school and this reminds me why, because the level of quality per dollar is simply unmatched by any other company. I'm not a Sony fanboy by any means and I own an xbox, not a playstation. However, when it comes to headphones, Sony has it down.

All of that is just to say that Sony is a pretty safe choice for any headphones and these are no exception! I'm not paid.

I got this Sony MDR-XB50AP/L for free from a rewards program of my card. The sound quality is more of a full range speaker - better clarity on highs and mid-range sound, the bass is not actually ""extra"" but rather it's enclosure was tuned for the upper mid-low frequencies (~300hz) thus giving an impression of ""extra bass"". I would rate the sound quality as 7/10 given it's size. The real downside on this unit is it projects a more pronounced rubbing noise of it's wire as it touches the collar of my shirt or coat as I move my head around. It is more annoying when people would hear it's rubbing sound while I'm on a conference call as if I was toying with my mic! Sony needs to improve the quality of its wires as this one feels like it's an electrical wire and not of a softer smoother one like the Apple headsets. This now becomes my backup headset for my daily calls and music while commuting.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Even the day before they went out, it was still great quality sound. They were originally $50-60 4 years ago, but now they’re about $30. I played call of duty competitively with them and I could hear footsteps and more things usually than teammates with $250/300 Astro headsets.
Part of it is because I have an adapter on my controller to adjust the sound (only $25 though) and I’ve used both for the 4 years and had no issues. I’ve also had a problem with every single earbud staying in my ear my entire life, even the brand “YurBuds” that came with a “Guaranteed to never fall out” but I’ve never had a problem with these falling out.
Lastly, they block out sound very well too. Other earbuds, such as Apple's, let in sound where these don't. I have even put these in without any sound to block out some sound to focus more on work. They don't act as noise-canceling earbuds, but they are decent at it.

Considering that I'm reverse slope (low frequency) hearing impaired and finding decent headphones to compensate is difficult,  I was very very pleased with this set.

I have used Skullcandy, iHome, and many different store brands. All have worked but required me to crank the volume on my phone past their pre-set hearing safety levels to get the fullest sound.

I plugged in these bad boys and I didn't have to take them above, I actually needed to turn them DOWN for once. While these headphones do stick out of my ears, the way they're shaped and the included eartips let me adjust perfectly to fit my ears.

I love these headphones. I can HEAR the bass, which has always been an issue for my particular brand of hearing loss but it doesn't drown out the vocals for me.

I love these headphones and would most definitely recommend and buy again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

As advertised... the bass will make you fall in love with these pair of earbuds. Built-in microphone works great for phone calls. Single dual-purpose button to Play/Pause music and to Pick/End a call. No volume control button though.
Flat wires that don't entwine as mush as normal ones do..... means more durability.
Not to forget, if you too are a bass freak, use the right sized ear buds that fit properly in your ears to get the real booooomm boooooooom effect.

It wasn't until the third time I used them that there was no sound in the right earbud and now there's moments when I plug them in that there's no sound again from the right earbud. For context my previous earbuds, skullcandy ink'd 2, lasted me three years since I kept good care of them by not shoving it in my pockets, neatly wrapping them up in a circle whenever I put them away, and being careful not to tug/yank on them while plugged in. It was pretty disappointing to see that these new earbud I just bought came broken, nonetheless they're still comfortable to use and ok to listen to music but I would recommend to buy something else.

3/29/18- It's been a good 8 months since I bought these earbuds and I did have problems with them at first but I've changed my phone recently and to my surprise all of the problems I had was because of my old phone, not these earbuds. The sound hasn't dropped at all after changing phones and the bass sounds much better now. I take back what I said about these earbuds, if you're looking for an affordable earbud headset(they were $29.99 when I bought them) with good bass then I'd suggest buying these sony earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However, I do have a pair of old $20 Sony earbuds I’ve had for about 5 years and I thought of finally getting myself a second set. I decided on these. They’re clearly louder and have a bit more bass, mainly noticeable towards electronic music but you can hear slight sounds you never notice, like from rock music of guitar string pulls more clearly. I’m no audiophile by any means, just an average person wanting better sound even if slight for a decent price. These are of good quality, sound wise and material built wise than the earbuds I already have and can tell will last me a long time. These have a stylish look to them and for me, fit in my ear comfortably. They give you different sizes of ear pieces for different ears. People say the buds feel bulky and heavy but I don’t feel that or notice heaviness. Wonder if I have strong ears? Overall, I love them! The mic and controls are a bonus.

*Edit: Some paint have chipped off within three days. I don’t handle them brutality but the paint doesn’t stay too long. However, they still look really nice and it’s a really minor thing but a warning that if you’re really picky.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

But anyway, I'm a certifiable bass junky, I want the bass to sound like I'm standing right next to the bass players speaker cabinet, sure these earbuds cover the other frequencies, that's easy to do, reproducing bass takes a little more know how, so yes, I finally found them, just awesome sounding, and they fit perfect too, oh and did I mention they put out brain melting bass? ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

By far the best sounding buds I've ever heard....and I've owned over 20 pair over the years.  I also own a pair of SONY MDR XB-500 headphones and both are excellent for all types of music genre!  I'd give a slight edge to these buds.  The sound is clear and present....not muffled or too booty.  The bass is certainly present and FULL, but not overbearing.  There is a bit of sound cancellation or isolation from the fact these plug your ears, but it's a positive feature and I enjoy it.

Not recommended for runners.","August 3, 2018","I decided to treat myself and spend a little extra when buying bass-enhanced earphones this time, but I think this product was worth it. Yes, the music quality is good and the extra bass is certainly noticeable, but it is about the same music quality that I have gotten with cheaper earphones that were half the price. What bothers me the most is their tendency to slip while I'm running. I have changed the size of the buds and still find myself constantly pushing them back into my ears. I've tried buds from previous pairs of earphones that never gave me that problem and still have this issue, so I think it's due to the design/shape of these earphones which is significantly different (more posterior) from anything I've tried before.

I didn't notice the right angle near the input jack when I bought it. I'm not really a fan of that, but it's just a personal preference. The mic works fine. Not much to say there. I'm hoping that the increase in price will pay off in terms of durability and that these will last me longer than the cheaper pairs I've previously purchased. Those have typically lasted anywhere from six months to a year of almost daily use at the gym and when commuting in all kinds of weather. I don't have very high expectations in that regard though because they do not look or feel more durable. Rather than pay double fore these, I'd rather get two cheaper ones with the same music/mic quality. Would not recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Right here!","May 6, 2016","As a musician, I use my ear buds A LOT. 2-3 hours a day normally, sometimes longer. Every single day.

I went through a phase where I was dropping cash on ear buds at Best Buy - to get a really good idea of what was good, and what wasn't. Skull Candy busted after about 2 months, I tried a couple other ones, same thing, and some didn't even last 3 weeks (one side would always cut out on all of these).

I purchased these for around $45 at Best Buy, and they lasted a good 6 months - I also liked having the bass boost because it made the music sound full, and not like I was listening to a radio.

Until something better comes along, I will be buying these because the sound quality is amazing, they last a long time, and the price is perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Nope.  One earbud just came apart by itself less than a couple of weeks past the return window.  Gotta give their engineers credit for that incredible combination of timed engineering.

I'm not too sure if they give ""extra bass"", but the sound quality is good enough that I don't really care about the bass. The extra ear buds are nice in case I end up losing one.

I tend to abuse my headphones and use them only at the gym or sometimes when I'm doing work at a Starbucks. (Yeah sometimes I'm ""that guy""). The cord is very tangle resistant and it only takes a couple seconds to get them ready after I stuff them back in their bag after finishing a workout.

The sound quality is a strong point as well,  but I'm far from an audiophile. Bass comes through well and treble doesn't feel compromised.

If you're reading this, I'd just say buy this pair. That will save you the three hours I spent comparing a bunch of comparable headphones at this price point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Fritz","Sadly disappointed :(","November 16, 2014","I have used Sony earbuds for so many years. I've had 4 pairs of the walmart $12 earbuds which are better than any other cheap ones I've tried. I have a pair of HBH-IS800s that blow my mind as far as quality of sound goes which drove me to buy these because the HBHIS800s have very deep bass. I had such joy when buying these from Best Buy thinking they would be as nice and high quality of sound as my HBHIS800s but sadly the sound is terrible... They have a very tinny sound and very disappointing bass... Their advertised range of sound as low as 4hz which I could feel all the way up to around 22k hz(couldn't hear the last 2k advertised hz). The volume when plugged into my iPhone could not be raised higher than half without the sound becoming very staticky as well as plugging them into my PC. The bass was not that impressive. Overall the sound was worst than my $12 pair of Sonys which made me sad because I had such high hopes for these!

I took them back to BestBuy and recently bought a pair of Razer Hammerheads that blew away the quality of sound my Sony HBHIS800s have!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_84?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Durability: I have pulled on them, ripped them off my phone, and got them caught on door knobs. THESE ARE EXTREMELY DURABLE.
Sound Quality: I used the sound quality optimization technology provided on Samsung phones, and these are best with such a feature. I turned on the soft timbre of a subwoofer, and I'm in love.

What else do you need?

The ear buds on the other hand, feel well made and durable. They do look a little funny and feel just as funny (because of the tips they include) , but they are comfortable. The bass as advertisied is strong and able to withstand very deep and loud bass. I felt that the bass lacked a kick, but even now I'm impressed with how well it handles deep bass. The sound quality over all isn't what I'd expect from sony headphones, and was a bit disappointing.
Even though the overall quality was disappointing, because they are Sony headphones; I can see why these headphones were made with more cost effective materials to provide a good bass system, but if you want an overall good pair of headphones I would recommend saving some money and/or investing into a good pair of headphones within the $ 100 - 150 range. I have upgraded to a much better pair of headphones by another company. I got them as a gift, and they are headphone within the $100 - 150 range and the overall quality of the headphones and the sound is very pleasing, and I wouldn't hesitate to pay more $50 to 100 for a better pair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The second pair was going to be used primarily for working out and running. I must say, these do not do well if you're looking to go for a run with them. The sound quality is good overall, but the earbuds keep falling out. I don't believe it's an issue with them not fitting securely - it's most likely that they are a bit too heavy for the constant pounding. In the gym, they were great. They're snug, so there's an inherit 'noise cancellation' and again, the sound is good.

In the end, I took this to the office and use them at my desk (great if that's what you're looking for) and have gone back to using my MDR-EX90LP headphones for workouts/running.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

First off, my use case is for my cellphone only. I use these with my Google Pixel XL like all earbuds I buy. Which means no EQ tweaking, not much power driving them, just cell phone spec usage.

Secondly, I am blown away at how well these sounds. Its crazy to have it hit so low in terms of bass, it doesn't shake your head, but it lightly vibrates your ear and you get this weird feeling because normally bass that low, you feel it more than you hear it. With these, because it does vibrate your ear a little, you can hear it, and your brain goes ""shouldn't I feel this?"". Which isn't a bad thing, its nice to hear details you normally don't with cheaper headphones, or headphones with specs that simply don't hit that low. The highs are crisp, the mids are clear and ""flat"" like they should be. I am very impressed with the sound quality of these earbuds. While I am promoting the bass, even though they are ""extra bass"", its not extra base in the sense of ""muddy"" its more like ""extra base vs other earbuds"" which means quality sound. Trust me, the bass is NOT overpowered.

Thirdly the fitment. Most earbuds out of package don't feel right, they don't seal in my weird ass ears and I end up playing with the various tip sizes to get a proper fit. However with the way these seal, the basic size right out the gate fit no issue, it more so rests on your ear instead of going INTO your ear. (best way for me to explain it). Think of other earbuds as a giant rock that only seals a cave entrance once its been inserted inside the cave by a few feet. Where as the sony's are like a giant boulder that seals along the outside of the cave entrance like a cover stone. I actually prefer this as they seal well which helps with the bass response.

Finally, the comparison. I have reviewed sennheisers (which I am a huge fan of their normal studio headphones, but not their earbuds) and other cheap off brand as well as cheap known brand earbuds. These sound the absolute best. Even comparing to the 99.99 bose earbuds, these sony's just sound way better. The only difference between the sony's and the bose is that if you want to lay your head down on a pillow, resting on the side of your face and ear, the bose are way more comfy and you can sleep with them in, while these protrude just a little to where you might get some ear agitation which isn't a huge deal. So at the moment I use the sony's as long as I can, and IF I sleep with my earbuds in (binaural beats use) then I will switch to the bose so I can lay on my ear with zero discomfort or ear pain.

6/5 I recommend you try these sony's. I got the blue pair as I like a little color in my life, ive had enough black and white earphones/earbuds to last a lifetime, its nice to get blue or red at times when possible. Doesn't change the overall performance of the earbuds so I highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I can happily say these are worth the 35-50 dollars over the Other 3 earbuds i have had over the years. They are much cleaner sounding than the Apple Earbuds, have better bass than the samsung and are much less ear fatigue listening to different genres for extended periods than even the RHA-T10i that I did a long review on apple site about. RHA T10i while very comfortable and premium build and feel, they just aren't worth the price that they cost and the sound they produce. I read many reviews of these sonys and while advertised as extra bass are by no means over bass heavy like the RHA were. Even with the treble filters in the RHA-T10i, they were too bass heavy at times, and not very flat natural sounding. These Sony MDR-XB50 headphones have a much cleaner sound and are just as comfortable as the RHA, and sound much better overall when comparing them to my apple EarPods, samsung freebies or the RHA T10i. Time will tell how they hold up, but initial sound is a much improved upgrade over the pairs i was replacing, I can recommend these over the RHA-T10i which cost about 3-5 times this price and these have a bigger soundstage to boot. If you don't like the remote, you can purchase these from sony japan without the mic remote. I don't need the remote but discovered the non remote model after ordering these. These so far have been a pleasure to listen to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These will get loud","April 22, 2019","Just received these earbuds in blue color 3 days ago and so far I gotta say they're pretty good. Sound quality is quite clear with the lows not muddying the highs and mids. Only thing lacking is the staging of the sound. My other earbud has more presence in the music but these are more louder and just as clear. These sound more in your ears than other earbuds. The bass is quite good. Not overpowering but the presence of it is more in the forefront compared with the highs. These are not audiophile earbuds and may not be the most accurate, but still I tend to use these earbuds most compared to others i have. I love the bass coming out of these. Sounds great for hip hop or edm. I have tried them for rock and pop and these sound good in them as well. I totally recommend these earbuds for those looking to not spend a lot of money. They sound better than the price. I would compare these with beats, but they sound better.  Bass driven. Way cheaper. These will stay in my rotation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Pros:
- Very Well Packaged

- 4hz - 24000hz (WTF SUPER SONIC HEADPHONES?)
- Sound quality is very good
- Has Outside noise reduction
- Gold Plated Headphone Jack
- Tangle-free wires
Cons:
- No volume changing buttons

This is all I can think for now. These earphones are the best compared to some of the older ones I have. There is something that seems unbelievable, which is the freqeuncy it can run on.

EVENTUALLY one may pop off (they are suppose to so you can change sizes) and you may lose it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The perfect balance of highs and lows. I have searched and spent over $100 to find the perfect under $40 pair of earbuds. Skullcandys... Ha no mids at all so you got no vocals, Symphonized? Everything sounds like wood so it's all muddy with no upper register. Panasonic? Ifrogs? No depth for either and sound plasticy. What is a guy to do!? Well I got by with the cheap Sonys because they at least got the mids and highs more or less right which is more than what I can say for other companies in this price range so I took a chance and I am so glad I did! Not overpowing pounding bass but the kind you can FEEL. The best kind! Buy these now and listen to some Owl City to get what I mean. You keep that vocal clarity and an ever so slight treble roll off so it's not ear piercing like the lower end sonys can be at times.

Overall, great quality for the price!","July 22, 2018","I spent a long time searching through different earbuds and their reviews before finally deciding on these. The biggest criticism I would offer, following the sentiments of several other customers, is that you do hear an annoying bumping sound whenever the cord is tapped or scraped. I use these earbuds primarily for doing work at my desk, so I rarely experience this sound, but for anyone wanting to use these while exercising or moving, I would caution them about this issue.

Other complaints include that the button for playback on the cord does not include volume control, so it's function is limited, and the earbuds do start to feel a little uncomfortable after a long time wearing them.

As for the sound quality, I was a bit nervous about the ""Extra Bass"" feature of the earbuds, but after a month of using them, I have to say that it is not overwhelming at all. In fact, these earbuds provide exactly the sound quality I was looking for. Not at all unbalanced, and a clean quality to the sound at both ends of the range. The earbuds are also well-built, as they haven't shown any sign of wear in the time that I've owned them.

In all, while I do notice the flaws I listed above, I feel that these are the best earbuds I've owned in a long time. Well-built and sturdy, fairly comfortable to wear, and great sound quality. I would absolutely recommend these and purchase them again in the future!","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Finally","October 4, 2016","First thing I noticed was how big they were. Yes they're big. It doesn't really matter, they're not insanely big and really don't stand out much.
Then I noticed the amount of base. Yes, these are ""Extra Bass"", but so are a lot of headphones now a days. But this really is Extra Bass. I had to turn down the bass on my phone to hear the songs properly. It drowned out the rest of the music easily.
Finally, the issue that made me return these: They're extremely uncomfortable. I was using these to go to work and then to listen to music at work. You can't wear them for more than an hour. The housing that sits right after the plugs lightly pushes against your ear to the point where it begins to hurt after a while.
I've never had earbuds this uncomfortable in the past. It's reminiscent of old round earbuds from the early 2000's. the hard plastic pushing up against your ear constantly is just not worth it.
I'm sure that this is dependent on the shape of your ear, but for me it was highly uncomfortable.
Other thing to note: the mic sucks. I've read this in reviews but figured it couldn't be that bad. It was. I talk to people on my phone daily while using headphones and most people had a hard time hearing me. I had to get my voice uncomfortably loud while in public and talking on the phone, which I really dislike.

Sad to say, but not a recommended product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They're also very good at noise isolating. The mic is also very good but you need a little louder than you probably sound normally.

I use an Fiio X3/E12 and Rockboxed iPod/Cayin C5.  I don't hear well so, I do push a bit of power through earphones.  These had a nice sound.  I really did not find them to be Bass heavy.  I only use aftermarket tips (Comply/Veritas) as I don't get a good seal it seems with the usual supplied tips.
After a week, I started hearing a distortion or hiss out of the left earphone.  I wasn't sure if it was them or me.  I put more power into them and there was definitely something happening with the left earphone.
I liked the sound, they are a bit on the large side.  I was surprised the bass was not muddy as I have found with other ""bass enhanced"" earphones.  They can handle some power, not sure how much but, I only used them for a week.  I had to return them.  I may buy them again.

I tried these on a variety of genres and they all sound great. From classical to EDM to hip hop, these headphones are amazing.

They do need to be snug in your ears to get the richest sound.
They stay in my ears well and come with different sizes of silicone tips to help with this.
The button and mic seem to work well on android at least.

The bad: the microphonics/stethoscope effect is very prominent and annoying, the worst trait of these headphones. Even when you turn your head and the cord brushes against your shirt, the unwanted rustling noise is created. I'm not sure if this is common to all in ear ear buds with silicone tips though. The shape of the ear pieces makes it difficult to do any sort of wrap around your ear trick to minimize the effect as well.
Also, they aren't very comfortable due to the shape, which makes it feel like they dig in after a while.

All in all, good sound quality but loud and annoying microphonics really undermines being able to be totally happy with these headphones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Excellent set of earbuds, if a bit heavy. The sound is loud and full of bass as advertised, which is perfect for electronic music and hip-hop. Muted mids and highs compared to my cheap sennheiser earbuds, but the trade-off is worth it to me. Excellent sound isolation (could be bad if running on the sidewalks), but perfect for office work or exercise in the gym.

Only complaint is the weight; they can get a bit heavy and make my ears hurt after a few hours of listening, but taking breaks eliminates this issue.

I was happy with the first pair, but when I lost them I tried out a few others to see if there was something better in the general $30 price range.  I returned all of them and went back to these.  When I misplaced the 2nd pair temporarily, I didn't even hesitate - I got a new pair. This time I got them in bright blue to make them easier to locate.

I don't think they should use the term ""noise cancellation"" for earbuds like these. They do an excellent job of sealing in my ear canal and that makes them perfect for listening to music or podcasts in noisy environments, but they do not have active cancellation circuitry and if I'm on a conference call, I still have to mute the mic except when I'm talking if there is any background noise.

Great wired earbuds and impossible to beat at this price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Not everyone is an audiophile, but some are, and those who are not and those who are often have similar budgets. So what exactly do you get for your almost 40 dollars worth in these earbuds? Well, actually, something not too shabby at all.

Now the unfortunate reality of earbud buying is that almost everyone has had a run in with some higher priced, better sounding set of earbuds and this relative comparison haunts us every time we try to find a new set of buds. Really what we are asking is ""do these sound like listening to music through a makeshift coke can stereo amplifier or, as we know it today, regular audio?"" Audiophiles, the people who care deeply about the waveform of audio, the highs, mids, and lows, they will be decently satisfied. The bass response is absolutely on par for what you would expect, deep and rich. The mids are there, and so are the highs. Often it depends on the music, but they are, dare I say, brilliant-sounding? The whole ""in ear isolation"" thing gets a little annoying over time. After prolonged use, removing them feels like removing suction cups from your ears and allowing blood flow back to that area.

Now, in my honest opinion, people buy earbuds or headphones in three different ways. Cheap, that is under 50 dollars. Sorry but that is quite cheap by todays standards. If you try to get away with anything less than that, you will be trying to convince yourself constantly that the sound is actually good, when it really isn't. Then, by spending a moderate amount of money, anywhere from 60 to 500 (people have odd justification for pricing these days) and then wildly expensive. The wildly expensive prices range from 1000 to 4000.

Rest easy. Yes, there is a 79.99 pair somewhere out there that are wireless, and bluetooth, and let the sun shine out of your a** at the gym, but these will get the job done AND they will not break the bank and when you put them in and turn on the music you wlll smirk and say, ""yeah, those were definately worth the price."" To me, thats all that matters. That when you put the earbuds in, you don't feel like you just got jipped.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

That is when I started looking for a new set of earbuds at a competitive price. I did not want to spend too much on earbuds (as I already have a set of bluetooth over the ear head phones) and mostly wanted to use the earbuds at work OR while working out. That is when this one caught my eye. Owing to the overall good reviews in multiple websites as well as the price, I decided to go for it (Took the Blue one as I just love the color). Oh man, these headphones really do pack a punch. The extra bass feature is really good and adds the extra oomph. The overall audio quality is awesome and the earbuds are really comfortable for wearing over a long time. It has sufficient amount of noise suppression to keep out the unwanted noise.The tangle free cords make it really easy to pack/unpack it with ease. The carrying case could be better, but the pouch serves its purpose and I am extremely happy with this one. Don't think twice, just go for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've never used super high quality earbuds from companies like Bose or Beats but these Sony earbuds have a great bass component and very clear concert sound.  You can hear different instruments and voices very clearly.  For the money, the sound quality is great.

My only real complaint with them is that I bought them primarily for working out and the ear pieces are so heavy, that they don't stay in your ears very well.  Whenever I try to run or lift weights with them, I'm constantly having to shove them back into my ears.  This is annoying and I've mostly given up on using them for working out and only use them for sitting at my computer.

If you're looking for high quality sound, definitely get these.

I'm quite disappointed with this pair and I will return them. Totally not worth the price.
And the cord is short... it may be standard length but it's not enough to use comfortably on a jog with your phone in your pocket or on the treadmill. Unless you're a little person or child.

Not even after I ""burn"" it after a few hours, which does nothing at all. I don't hear too more bass from it at all compared to Panasonic/Apple one.

Also i I find when I use it on iphone, I can only put the sound level at the minimal, otherwise it will sound too loud for my ear. And the Mic does not work well at all.

The most annoying thing is that it is not comfortable to wear at all! It does not feel good when I first wear it -- the bottom of the earbud is simply too heavy and too big! Even I tried the smallest earbud it does not feel better. And it starts to hurt after one hour of wearing! The 12-buck Panasonic one is much comfortable than this!!  I will certainly return it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The build quality is very good and there is an in-line mic. I bought a pair of these and a pair of cheaper creative labs earbuds, looking for some decent noise isolation. Both work well. These have a richer sound, but they also cost more, so that equals out. My only advice is to try out all of the different size ends (Sony sends 3 extra sizes, so 4 total). Getting the best fit really helps with noise isolation. Oh, and compared to the over-the-ear headphones I tried out, earbuds work much better for blocking out noise. (I haven't tried noise cancellation yet, which will be my next step if these don't work well enough for me at my office.

I love the Sport head sets the most but they have an annoying habit of breaking the important wires near the ear bud area because the ear inserts pop out. It's a quality issue with Sony. Sony, listen up, if I pay $20 for these, and I have 3 times - they better hold up (they're not). Like they care.

On to the real review. These heavy bass head sets are intense. Mid range and highs are diminished by the bass, so expect that. But, if your player has controls to tweak it, then you'll be in control and happy. Otherwise, bass rules...and it's good with these phones! The sound is great. Strong cords, and a multi-pack of different sized earbuds with a velvet bag for keeping make this a good buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I do not recommend running with them. The buds themselves are pretty heavy and they slip out. And if the cord moves too much the sound cuts out. (Which is concerning. Does anyone else experience this?)

I got these the 13th of this month. I'll come back later (hopefully more than a year, I haven't had a pair of earbuds last more than 9 months) when one side of the earbud inevitably cuts out.

I really enjoyed these earbuds and was disappointed when they didn't begin working anymore. I started searching online for another pair of earbuds to buy and I came across the same exact ones that I bought at the store. I purchased/ordered them again and they are just as good as I remembered. These earbuds make listening to music really enjoyable and smooth. They do a great job blocking sounds other than your music so you can enjoy your music. While listening to music you can tell that they do a fantastic job at making the music sound great. The earbuds are also comfortable to wear and you never feel like its hurting your ears. They fit just right to give you a great experience. I think the best part of these earbuds is the microphone that comes with it. The microphone makes it really useful for calls on my smart phone. The only issue I have with this product is how long they last. I stated that I bought the product several months ago which is not that long. The problem is that only one of the earbuds will work and eventually neither of them will. I wish they could last a couple of years so that I wouldn't have to re-purchase them so frequently. I think this product is worth buying especially when it's on sale. I never regretted purchasing these because it feels like I got my money's worth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The bass is just right . Not ""boomy"", but it will reproduce subsonic bass sounds that you can almost 'feel'. Bass sounds are very natural and I no longer need to enhance the bass compensator or an App with a bass or treble booster, upon my Samsung Tablet.
Same with my Sony Walkman CD player. I use a receiver with digital tuning for AM/FM Radio. All sound very natural and great. The treble is never 'spitty', but quite smooth.  One of  this year's best purchases, as far as stereo products go. I recommend them to people when I can and they are definitely a Five-Star pair of earphones. I suggest you get a pair ASAP!

The sound is awesome for music. I had a hard time finding earbuds for my iPhone and iPad that had great bass and these are the best. I've had these for over a year now and they are still kicking. I have treated them terribly - they've been smashed, squished, dropped, etc. and they haven't missed a beat! The only complaint I have is the cord is constantly tangled. This is irritating because I find myself untangling them every time I pull them out of my purse... nothing I do keeps them from tangling when not in use. Other than that, I highly recommend these for listening to music. When these wear out, I'll be replacing with the same model because for the money, you can't get any better sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Headset was intended for use on smart-phone, computer and mp3. Overall design is sleek and stylish, not made with very high quality materials, but you get what you pay for. This headset is well-made and solid in structure for how cheap of a purchase it was, only paid $38, which is a steal in my opinion. The ear piece is somewhat comfortable, but can get a little irritating after long periods of usage, the sound quality is average and does not provide noise cancellation as it is not intended to do so, and the overall sound is not as clear as the higher priced headsets. The headset does however produces a surprising amount of bass and provides the extra punch of bass like the over-ear headphones produce. Definitely a must-have if you do not want to spend too much on a great pair of in-ear headsets, but do not want to sacrifice quality and good bass. They are good for all genres of music, but is definitely better for music that contains a variety of bass tones, such as hip-hop and electronic dance music (aka dubstep).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have owned the first pair that I purchased for almost three years now, and they have been used for college, running the tractor, working out, dirt biking, yard work, etc.  They have actually even been washed four times.

I would recommend these for anyone looking for earbuds that don't cost a lot of money, but sound good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I initially bought these to test the claims people made, saying that these Sony earphones are better than Beats By Dre. I've used both and can say I slightly prefer these, and not just because of the price. From closing them in car doors to crumpling them in tight jean pockets, these things are DURABLE. I'm writing this review after finally noticing that my headphones have stopped functioning, and I'm about to order another one because these are truly the best for only ~$30. The bass is nice and strong, with nice mids and great highs. These work with Android and iPhone devices, so no worries there, and the mic quality doesn't fall short of my expectations at all. These are a solid pair of headphones. I wish I could give a negative aspect about them, but I've got nothing. Honestly, I could've gotten another year outta these if I treated them better, but ehhh it was only $30 anyways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These things are awesome. They have strong bass as the name suggests and good sound. Their functionality with my (Android) Sony Xperia Z3v is awesome. You can play/pause, skip to next song, or skip to previous song, depending on how many times you click the button on the microphone piece in rapid succession. I think you can also use the button to initiate voice commands but I don't use these for that. They muffle out a lot of external noise and I'll let you decide if that's a perk or not.

When I first got them I wasn't as impressed with the bass as I wanted to be, so I gave it time to get better after breaking them in. They never really did. They sound good but the bass isn't what I thought it would be, but it could just be my unrealistic expectations.
They protrude significantly out of my ears; they are large (as you can see in the pictures, compared to another set). But they don't slip out of my ears like other earbuds would. In addition, the plastic cushion that goes in my ear doesn't come off easy like I have also found to be the case with others. Very good quality like I said.

I like these the most for the great durability and quality. I have used them every day for two months and they seem to handle slight drops here and there very well. They also withstood pulling and being pressed in my pockets.

Because it was so good I'm going to replace my lost one and buy another one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are pretty stylish in blue with the useful tangle free cord, and have good noise cancellation. Compared to the earbuds from the Galaxy S5 which I upgraded from, these are better in every aspect. My Galaxy S5's volume only goes up to 15, but compared to the stock earbuds, the 15 on these is equivalent to what would be more like 18. They are clearer and have noticeably more bass. I use them every day and they are very comfortable. They also come with a nice little pouch and replacement tips.

UPDATE 7/5/2015: Yesterday at a 4th of July party, I dropped my phone with earbuds attached into a lake. I jumped in after it, but could not find it in 5 feet of water. It was too murky to see down for them. I just kept stepping where I thought it fell, and after 5 minutes or so of pulling up plants, the earbud wire caught my food. I pulled it up and the phone was still attached. Both still work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

-Con: only con is they r heavy at first and can be irritating because of so. I've had my pair since April 2016 so my ears no long experience fatigue but just a heads-up :D
-Also my first pair was damanged goods because one ear didn't work. But I'm not discouraged easily nor do I complain as much as others.
-OVERALL: GREAT PRODUCT N I RECOMMEND TO ANY N ALL MUSIC/ZONE-OUT LOVERS ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Paint started coming off pretty quickly but otherwise incredibly worth it. They survived heavy use pretty much everyday for two years and being chewed by a small dog twice. After two years they have a quiet static noise probably caused by the dog but its only noticeable at very low volumes. Very durable design and clear sound quality. Bass doesn't drown out mid or high range sound. It's probably time for a new pair now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/product-reviews/B00JE0AQPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wore these and listened to music for 5 seconds and I was shocked. The bass is AMAZING. This is the easiest buy for 30$, with crystal-clear sound, incredible bass, and cool looks. The earbuds I got were pictured as a ""light blue"", but when I got them they were a darker blue with a metallic look, which looked way cooler. The structure is nice, the removable ear-pieces don't fall off so easily, but you can remove them and put them back on without a sweat. Overall I recommend this as the best sound for 30$.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""
