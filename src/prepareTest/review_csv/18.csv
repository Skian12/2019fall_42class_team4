I bought these because I wanted something better than the super-cheap Walmart ones I had been using.  These have a very good bass, the sound is good, and the padding eliminates most of the room noise. The cord is plenty long and seems to be made of high quality silicone rubber. The plug end is metal, and has a metal spring to help prevent damage. Overall the quality seems rather good. I don't think you can go wrong for the money spent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

My brother is a fourth grader who also uses the headphones. This is an amazing product that produces good tone quality and is decently good at noise cancellation. It is so good to use while doing my online homework. I can block out all the sounds while playing video games on my computer. Before, in class, when my friends all had to watch an educational video, I had no headphones to do the job. I had to do it at home. But when I got this, I could do it with ease! My brother thinks the same with high praises. It also looks good on our heads. I have just one thing to say, though. It is too powerful. When I keep it at maybe a volume 10 out of 100, everyone not wearing headphones can hear it clearly.

They do not block noise surrounding you, but I didn't want that because I need to be able to hear what's going on around me and didn't want to be completely blocked when using them.

Carrillo","I can finally listen to music for most of the day","September 25, 2019","I tried all the earbuds, all the types, styles, etc and I give up.  Either they're uncomfortable or they fall out (yes I've tried the different sizes of pads too).  Also, I don't want to fuss with bluetooth because I pair my phone with a speaker at home, but I want to listen privately at work, and switching back and forth is too much hassle.  Plus a wire doesn't bother me.
The are quite comfortable.  The only problem I have is they are just a little tight, which is surprising since I have a small-ish head.  They tend to hurt my ears after a while but that's mainly because I wear glasses.... So not entirely the headphone's fault.  Next time I get new glasses I'll opt for frames with thinner ear pieces, that should do the trick.

They have very good sound, especially for $15.  And the pads and headstrap are comfortable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are great for that.  The connector is metal enclosed so I am sure it will withstand time and use.  The sound quality is quite nice.  The cushioned ear pads are comfortable.

Headphones are simplistic and sleek looking, not too eye-catching (in a good way). The sound is comparable to higher-priced headphones I've tried in the past - Punchy bass, clear highs, and a good soundstage. They feel snug but not tight, and are closed-back so they block a lot of external noise out and do not leak sound either. I did not purchase these for the microphone, but it is helpful to have and picks up fairly clear quality sound. Certainly one of the best performance-to-value ratio headphones out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The thousands of overly  positive reviews made me a little suspicious, but my wireless headset was just about dead and I needed something, even if it was just temporary.

The sound quality is very impressive. They're not as comfortable as the $70 over-the-ear headset I have, but they're not uncomfortable and they're also not as hot. I tested out the mic by recording my voice and it sounds good to me. Don't try and hold the mic up to your mouth, it'll sound worse that way.

Note that if you have a laptop or computer with multiple audio ports you will need an adapter cable to use the mic.

These exceeded my expectations. For a brand I never heard of, I was surprised of the sound quality and details of the build. They are small and versatile when your on the go and have a long enough wire to extend comfortably. Near the headphone jack, there is some wire support so you won't find exposed wire anytime soon. The headband is on the smaller side, but you can adjust the sides to the height of your head.

Place with caution as some vital areas are made out of plastic they may break if sat on or squished. It would be great if it had a volume control, but I understand it may be because to keep the costs down.

I almost forgot - Comfortable!  I have a relatively large head and these fit nicely on my head and over my ears.  You can't go wrong for this price.  I replaced two apple ear buds because I got tired of something being in my ear and was looking for something relatively inexpensive that could provide good quality and these compete for sure.  The 3.5mm jack is the best. its mesh like end provides the ability to grab on to and pull out of the 3.5mm port.  I constantly struggled with my old ear buds with these its much easier to unplug if you have to do a lot of that.

Cons:  I know I have a microphone.. the only thing I don't know on it is whether or not when i push the button if its on or off.  I would have liked to have a small red LED to identify when its on or off.

Overall:  Great product for the right price.

They are lightweight and don't squeeze his head.
The sound quality is great as long as you don't turn them up too loud during gaming.  If you do it echos in the other person's ears.
He loves the fact they fold over and rest on your shoulders so he can turn his head and not feel like he's being smacked in the face by the pads.  They lay flat and he forgets he has them on.
The mic works great.
The cord is a good length.

He said he'd give them 5 stars if it weren't for the fact they aren't noise cancelling.

It’s absurdly long and snags on literally everything. It happens at least once a day, which causes the headphones to unplug themselves and explains why they’ve now shorted out and I have to wrap the chord to hear out of one side, and they snagged going through the train turnstile and broke my phone screen. They’re also weirdly big, and the smallest setting is still too long for my ears, which gets really uncomfortable. Can’t say much for the noice cancellation when I’m not playing audio, but as far as sound they get the job done. Audio quality is good, not mind blowing, but you get what you pay for I guess. It also really bothers me that there’s a button on the chord whose seemingly only function is to pause what you’re listening to, no volume control, you can’t even skip tracks. Overall I recommend these if you have a long torso, a big head, and only listen to podcasts. Otherwise, there’s better stuff out there if you’re on a budget","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Here's the pros and cons, in my opinion:

Pros:
- Good sound quality
- Very portable (love that they fold up)
- Cord permanently secured to the headset (kids cannot lose the plug)

Cons:
- Didn't have a case (unless you want to keep them in the box)
- Small earpieces (great for kids, not so much for adults)

Durable!","November 24, 2019","If you search Amazon, under category On-Ear Headphones under $25, the Vogek is the first non-sponsored result. At 4-1/2 stars in 1878 reviews so far, it's worth a look.

My wife bought the headphones to use for playing educational tapes on a 20-year old (pre-bluetooth) Panasonic tape player.

Surprise! The headphones are excellent. The sound quality is very good. Notice the steel reinforcement around the cable near the jack, so that the cable doesn't break off there. The plastic seems to be sturdy and durable. We like how the headphones fold flat, but the ear cups swivel to fit comfortably over the ears.

Another thing you can use the headphones for is phone calls, because there is a mic in-line. I think the phone call experience is going to take a step up!

That being said, I unfolded them and they fit over my big head and the cushions were incredibly soft and comfortable on my ears. These do not cancel noise or block out noise and since that wasn't why I bought them, I didn't have that expectation. The wire has a small spring near the 3.5 mm plug, I assume to keep the wire from kinking and killing the sound (A common problem). The wire itself has a cheap plastic feeling and there is only the standard plastic grommet thing (technical term) the wire passes through were it connects to the headphones itself (Another common failure point). I plugged them up to my computer and ran some audio tests and these speakers had a rich range of sound that sounded better than the expensive speakers I have attached. The only thing I didn't test was bass because that is not my thing. Overall II am very pleased with the build quality and sound for the price. I would recommend these looking for a comfortable, great sounding pair of headphones at an affordable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I unfortunately pulled out the cord on my first pair by accident. I came back to the brand because I was very satisfied with the sound quality that these headphones provided. I'm not audio expert, but the sound from these head phones is high quality, and they do a great job of cancelling out outside noise. With the padded adjustable band, they fit quite nicely on my rather average head. For an idea of what I listen to, I tend to listen to a lot of Rammstein when I'm using these, and the music sounds just excellent.

We purchased a transmitter that sends a sound signal to a small receiver that you can plug a couple of headphones in to listen to the TV with better sound.  Finding the right headphones/earphones to listen with has been somewhat of an issue so I saw these Vogek headphones at Amazon.  They looked good and the price was very good so we ordered them.  When they came we pulled up a movie and plugged in the headphones.  The sound is terrific and because of the padding and fit they were very comfortable.  After wearing them through a 2 hour movie there was no discomfort and we were very happy to be able to understand the dialogue and enjoy the movie.  I've connected a pair to my ipod to listen to an audiobook and music and they work very well on that device.  They have a built in mic but haven't tried do a phone call yet.  We are very happy with our Vogek headphones.  They seem well constructed and have a sturdy cord so it appears they will be usable for quite some time.  Oh - they came in a little box about an inch and a half thick and when we finished listening we were able to fold them up and place them back in the box to store them in a drawer on our TV stand until the next time we need them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

For those more expensive ones you are usually paying more for the brand name then how well the headphones work. In the end it is price and quality that really matter and these headphones get 5 stars for both. It isn't just the sound quality though that gives it 5 stars. The ear pads on these headphones are very cushy which makes for a comfortable listening experience while playing your favorite tunes. As for anything negative I would say the noise cancellation is very good but doesn't block out all outside noise.

As a result, the muffs rests on an awkward position, causing soreness on the cartilaginous area of the ear. It becomes irritating after 20 mins of wearing. The sound quality is okay for the price, but nothing to write home about. The adapter for these headphones stays aggressively attached to whatever you’re attaching it to, but the sound gets buzzy with the slightest movement of the adapter. It gets annoying after a while if you’re doing physical activity with these on.
Personally, I would not recommend these headphones. Invest a little more money if you want a main day by day pair of headphones.

I had to choose 3 OR 4 out of 5, overall for Amazon's ratings)
-------
Without boring people with a full rundown of different headphones I use regularly, but just to name a few if people are wondering about how these compare to models generally in the same price-range,

I have used/still use (All of these ARE Sony) MDRV150, ZX310's, and some ZX100 and/or ZX110's.

One thing I will mention here is while I have worn then for hours at a time, I cant speak (on any topic with these) for long term use as in months down the line.

First Impressions:
  The moment I opened the box, I thought they looked small, though they fit just fine.  I have a pair of Sony ZX310's that fold the same way and when I compare them next to each other, they do look the same, size wise, so I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.  There is nothing wrong with the size.... maybe the earcups on the outside (just for looks) could be a tad bigger, but that is not where I'd tell the company to invest $$ to make these better.

Sound:
  This would be a Con ..... sort of .... well if there is any big cons with these, it's the sound  ...  it's not terrible ... it really isn't but it's not great either ... I have been messing with my eq's on my mp3 (sansa) mp3 players and my computer media players, to give these a fair shot.

  The Bass is Ok, the highs may be able to have improvement but the mids/mid-to-highs sound very muddy to me...remember I am not a regular user of say $100+ headphones so I understand things in this price range are not going to be perfect but I cant get the fact that these sound muddy to me, out of my head.  No matter what I do to the mids (EQ wise) the Lows and Highs sound off ... granted I have gotten use to their sound vs my other Sonys ... the Sony MDRV150's I have sounded way off to me too in the mid to high range at first.  I am much more of a fan of the Sony XZ100/110 series.

If all of this confuses you, just note that the muddy mids (say around the vocals) makes the sound, NOT sound ""crisp"" ..... this may be the TL/DR way of saying what I just did for sound quality

Build Quality:

  If you are even close to one of those people that have to have ""premium quality"" headphones you are not even considering  this price bracket anyway, however, for this price range these are not bad build quality wise ...

  Looking at pictures that other reviewers have posted, the wire seems thinner now that I have these, vs the images, but so for I suppose these are not bad.

  One thing I love is the almost spring (like you may find in some retractable pens ... as a comparison to what it looks like, I mean) around the end of the cable where headphone cables typically get flex damage causing one of the two sides to go out on you.  I am seeing this as something that will 100% protect against that happening and I wish other manufacturers would all include that little bit extra, that VOGEK has with these.

Comfort

  This is one reason I cant (so far)... bring myself to return these ... while I love my Sonys and they are by NO MEANS UNcomfortable .. these Vogek's are REALLY comfortable so far and even after hours of use, I have to say they are MORE comfortable then my Sonys..... not even counting the MDRV150's which felt tight and before I put more padding inside the earcups myself ... were even very LIGHTLY padded.

  Also these are not really over the ear headphones but the way the earcups sit on my ear these do block out alot of sound (not all, by any means ) noise that the Sony's do not ... note that NONE of these headphones are ""noise cancelling"".

Bottom Line:
  I want to like these more than I do but the muddy sound is a big issue.  If anyone from Vogek reads this ... I love these headphones and if the muddy sound in the mids, and maybe the sound would be more balanced.  If this is addressed and they sounded better in this regard, I may say these are better than my old favorite Sony ZX series headphones.  There are so many great things I love about these headphones but the mids being off and that making the sound seem unbalanced are holding these back from being at least a 4.5 out of 5 for me.

  If you are really curious about these, and see them at a good price, then these may be worth at least trying.

------
I have a pair of Sony ZX100's that while are not in the best condition, still work nearly 6+ years later (one key reason the they broke is user error ... I put them down way too hard once).... the POINT is that these may go for good any time now and even though we are getting out of storm season here in FL, I need pair I dont mind if they get a bit sweaty out in the summer months ... these may be my (that pair anyway) ""ZX100 backup pair""

----
Update after another day or two of constantly using these: ... yeah .... I dont see myself buying this model again ... they are by far (and none of my Sonys are UNcomfortable) more comfortable than even my old favorites, but the mids (say vocals) being so off, no matter what I do ... that is an issue ... would I consider this brand again if they had a new model, and I saw reviews ""they really improved the sound"" ... 110% YES ... even now ... I dont see myself returning these ... I WANT to like them more but that sound is an issue ... the bass is good but they just sound unbalanced vs other headphones I have.

I cant speak from experience but at least one person on Amazon who has had this model and the new model (I wasn't even paying attention to that) says the sound inbalance issue seems to be improved according to them and what they think ... so when considering these and seeing ""there is a newer model of these headphones"" that Amazon shows ... you may want to consider those ... Vogek MAY have already addressed my big/ONLY issue with these.

Last Update: I do not want to turn this into a blog, so this will be the last update unless there is say complete failure or something.  I have to say that with my Sansa Fuze+ (one of my mp3 players) and the settings I have used for years with my Sony's  .... these do not sound as bad ... I still have the same comments about the mids and the Sony's are better for the most part ... at least the ZX100's and 110's ... but .. .these are more in the same ballpark now I have used them a bit more ... the mid's sound and the unbalanced sound is still there but that is the only big issue . .other than that I love these.  My final rating is still 3.5 ... not low enough for ""3"" but not high enough for a ""4""... for $15.99 ... I'd consider going with the Sony's but some sellers have these for say $12 or less (what i paid) ... that is more reasonable .... The Sony's in general do not have as good Bass, BUT the sound including the mids at the same EQ settings on the same device just sound more balanced.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I hadn't heard of the Vogek brand and was skeptical, but given the price, features, and 12-month warranty, I decided to give this pair a try.

I wasn't disappointed.

The headphones come in a compact box, demonstrating their portability. I can easily fold them into a slim pocket of my work bag, which means I can easily take them wherever I go.

The design is sleek and modern, enjoyable to look at.

The sound quality is full and rich, what you'd expect of a more expensive pair.

The padded headband and ear cushions make things comfortable, and the adjustable levels easily conform to my head.

I'd never had a tangle-free cord before -- it's surprisingly helpful and convenient.

I haven't used the mic yet but it will be helpful for video conferencing down the road.

One disappointment is the way the headphones conform to my ears. If I try to wear them in the correct position for more than 15 minutes, my ears hurt. My ears are somewhat elvish in shape, however, so I don't think this is a drawback most people would experience.

Overall, these headphones are a great choice. With all the features, the sound quality, and the stylish look, it's apparent that a great deal of thought and care went into the design and manufacture. I'm happy with the purchase and will look for other Vogek products in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'm not much of an audiophile per se but these definitely sound a lot better than my old ones and the couple others I tried before getting these.

My only (very) minor complaint is that the headphone jack juts out slightly more than my old pair, requiring me to put my mouse pad an extra inch or so to the right due to the location of the headphone jack on my laptop.

I bought these headphones to replace some cheap ones that broke. I take good care of my headphones, however I use them all the time. I use them for listening to music/audio books, watching YouTube, and completing online schoolwork. So, I was looking for something that can handle a lot of use and be inexpensive enough to easily replace. After searching trusty Amazon and reading lots of excellent reviews; I chose the Vogek On Ear Headphones with Mic.

My first impressions were really good. The packing was professional and the headphones arrived in perfect condition. I chose red because it's my favorite color and I was impressed by how well the color matched to the photo online. The build doesn't feel cheap, actually I think part of the outside of the ear cups is metal. I like this detail and it doesn't make the headphones feel too heavy. Also, these headphones are very flexible for whether you need to adjust them or fit them in a confined space. Unlike other inexpensive headphones that I've tried, I don't feel like these would break with average use anytime soon.

After some use, I grew to really love this product.  The cushioning inside the ear cups and on the headband is a pleather material, however it's conformable even for long periods of listening to music. Sound quality is great and definitely worth the money. There's a tiny control box with the mic and one button. I discovered that this button pauses and plays your music/audiobook. It's very useful and a nice touch. The microphone is okay, I tested it on phone. It sounds a little muddy, but very understandable. I have the RIG 400HX Gaming Headset for my gaming and communicating, however this microphone would be fine for a quick match of Fortnite. I'll probably use these headphones for when I get a Nintendo Switch as they're more practical for portable gaming.

Overall, I highly recommend these headphones. They're great for somebody looking for awesome quality in an inexpensive package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

to review-us

I recently purchase a set of your Vogek Fold-Flat headphones for use in my office.  I was most impressed with 2 of your features.  First the fold-flat concept.  While most headphone manufacturers claim it, yours actually delivered.  The low profile, when folded, easily slips into the side pocket of my lap-top carry-on bag with no noticeable bulge.  A plus when using a high end leather bag.  It does not cause stretching or excessive where in the material.  The other feature  I really like is the tangle free cord.  Most days I use the headphones at my stand up desk. I move around quite a bit, and have not had to worry about it getting knotted or tangled.

I have recommended your headphones to others here in the company and we have actually ordered more of them to be used in our training rooms.  Thanks for a great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They sound is clear and the microphone works great too. It didn't come with instructions and the volume controls are hard to figure out.

I’m just a little concerned about the durability. The earmuffs fold for easier storage, but it kind of seems like the ear pieces might fall off any minute, since they seem to dangle loosely. I’m about to go on vacation, so I’m really hoping they don’t snap or break off.

UPDATE:
It’s been over a month, and I was wrong about the durability. They have held up perfectly, and I am not worried about them snapping! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The Voget headphones fit comfortably and, when jogging, remain solidly in place.
Sound quality is excellent and, even at high volume, distortion is not noticeable.  Those that habitually jog alongside busy and dangerous streets will be glad to know that background sounds will not be entirely overridden.
Strain relief is provided at both ends of the cable.  The headset’s band is adjustable to account for head size, and the earpieces can be twisted and folded for storage.  An inline microphone allows this device to be used with a cellphone.
I like the Voget headphone.  It is comfortable, inexpensive, and provides excellent sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wanted to get proper use out of them before I wrote this review.  I had previously purchased SONY noise cancelling headphones and I was very dissatisfied with them.  I purchased these after reading other reviews plus the fact that I didn't want to spend 300 bucks on headphones.  I think they are great.  Here's my breakdown:

Fit: They fit great and are extremely flexible to varying head types.  They are comfortable and don't place extra stress against your ears or jaw line, like other models do.

Sound:  I am very happy with the sound.  Very clear and crisp with minimal static.  I will say if you are listening to piano solos or classic instrumental sounds, you can hear very minor static in the background, but not enough to ruin your listening experience.

Quality:  Since my last set of Sony's broke within a week, I can already say the quality is better.  However, they are made of a nicer metal so they appear that they will last longer.  Also, the ear parts are very comfortable and appear well made.

Miscellaneous:  I have BIG ears.  My ears tend to actually fit inside of the ear pieces.  This helps with noise cancellation part.

Recommendations:  Overall I am very satisfied with this product.  The quality seems great, the sound is crisp, and the price was perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

There were, however, a few things I disliked about the product. The part that goes against your ear seemed too small (if it was big enough to surround my ear instead of smashing it, it would have been better.) The volume I always have to adjust on the computer. Instead of button, perhaps a turning dial would be better for adjusting volume. It's still a great pair of headphones. I recommend it definitely. The product would be better if the adjustments I listed above are applied to future ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Likes: They came in a tiny, tiny box all folded up neatly, so I can tell they're quite portable. They fit my head well, and are pretty comfortable. The end of the wire is protected by metal, to stop from bending or fraying. They're low profile. They sound great, especially for the price.

The sound and volume were also great for the price. However, cheap prices come with cheap components, and in this case it was the 3.5mm jack quality. Within just a few weeks of use, the jack started to show excessive wear, the plastic part of it (it's not a solid metal jack like you'd find on a better quality headset"" started having signs of color change indicating the plastic was being stressed. within a month it had broken where I had to ""wiggle"" the jack connection to get it in the perfect spot to have stereo from my iPad. Finally this weekend, it broke. While being disconnected. Leaving half the jack inside the iPad, out of reach. So now my iPad is fully broken. I can't extract the part that broke off as it's too deep in the jack, and and the iPad won't play audio through the speakers because it thinks a headphone is plugged in. I'm going to have to spend $100 to have a iPad repair joint take the iPad apart to manually extract the broken part. So glad I saved $5 on this headset so that after maybe two months of use my $600 iPad is unusable for anything requiring Audio.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Here's hoping this pair will be above the grade curve.

The barcode sticker on the box said this was ""without microphone"", while the box itself said it came with the microphone. There's a little plastic thing on the cable with a hole on it and a button I can't figure out what it does. Maybe the hole is the microphone? There wasn't any documentation to speak of, which is probably for the best since it was manufactured in China for no good reason. No idea what would control the volume either. It's a shame, but not a necessary feature for my needs, so I like what I got.

I think if I would change something about this pair of headphones at the time of this writing, I would give it a somewhat longer cable. Otherwise, it seems to be a very nice pair of headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

For my offspring that is a truly amazing thing, especially with a headset that has moving parts.  I will definitely be purchasing these again.

OP: I bought these to cover an emergency loss of prior headphones for a 15y/o. They were shipped right away and the boy was impressed with them. We both like the metal connector and the spring at the connection that will help prevent breakage at that point, a place that many of my son's headphone fail. He has used them for several days and hasn't had a single complaint (could be the end of days). More importantly, this affordably priced product is still working after four days despite the fact that my teen uses them 18 hours a day. There are a great many brands that can't make that boast. I am certain that there are higher quality (and more expensive) headphones out there, with all kinds of bells and whistles probably, but given how hard the boy can be on his hardware, I will be satisfied to come back to this brand again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Or if you are a child with a small head I suppose that would be okay too. But I am and adult and my head is average sized and the pressure on my ears is PAINFUL. I am constantly having to adjust the headphones to let blood circulate, I constantly am bending the frame to relieve the pressure, but it is plastic so it doesn't help. The foam is cheap so it doesn't provide much cushion... What it needs is some sort of horizontal frame adjustment instead of relying on the pressure.

I have used these to listen to Netflix and music. The balance of the sound is very middle of the line, which is perfectly fine for these types of headphones; they aren't specially designed for anything specific. At max volume on my computer, they don't seem to distort the sound too noticeably, which is good to have!  The noise cancellation with the sound off is decent, they aren't specifically built for it, but the foam does a good job of quieting sounds around you; and then with music, they keep your music contained.

They are comfortable and don't feel like they are putting too much pressure on my head or ears. They are definitely built for larger/ adult heads I would say. The chord also seems rigid enough to avoid kinks and tangles. The spring at the jack end is a nice addition!

Overall, I am happy with the rather inexpensive purchase, hopefully they last!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They arrived in very good condition in a small compact box. I love how the headphones fold up to be very compact and easily portable. It's compact size will easily fit into your purse, backpack, briefcase or luggage so you can enjoy it's use wherever you go. I was pleased with the sound quality on the headphones, it was clear and the bass sounded powerful. The ear pads were very soft and comfortable, which is a big plus. The headphones are adjustable to fit most size heads and I was able to use the microphone on the headphones to converse which was a nice feature. The buttons on the microphone allowed me to play and pause the music and also allowed me to skip to the next song or the previous one. However, I wish the microphone features were also compatible with a PC and laptop instead of just a phone and tablet.

It is probably too large for most toddlers but they will likely grow out of any kids' size headphones after a short amount of time. Our 6 year old could wear these headphones just fine; granted he does have a large head but the kids' size ones were way too tight. Another issue we came across with the kids' size options was that the sound was very limited, since manufacturers want to limit the decibels. I understand this but they are not a good option on a noisy plane. As very intentional parents, we first checked the volume on this headset and then offered it to our kids; this way they could hear perfectly over the noisy in-flight noises and still be safe, hearing-wise. These are excellent in sound quality; they are a night and day difference between the standard kids' sized options out there on Amazon.

As far as sound quality goes, these are competitive with other headphones way above their price range. They aren't going to out-perform $300 Sennheisers or anything, but they are easily on par with something you would find for $50. If that's what you are looking for, give these a shot first - you might just save yourself $40.

A few notes...
- The sound quality is surprisingly good for their price point, and I was shocked by the amount of bass they are actually able to output. It's not head-rattling, but they definitely have more capacity than I expected.
- They're not the most comfortable headphones I've ever tried (that award goes to the Phillips SHP9500s and would be hard to beat), but they're not the most uncomfortable pair either. As far as on-ear headphones go, these are pretty good in this area - I can wear them for several hours before they start to bother me. There are certainly worse options out there.
- I have not tried using the mic, so I can't comment on that one way or the other.
- I really like the metal strain relief they used on the plug. I have never seen any other headphones with that feature and it works well, so this helps elevate these above the rest.
- These don't have much in the way of noise cancellation, but they weren't advertised as such and I didn't expect them to, so no real problem there - just more of an FYI for anyone who might be curious. They do block a little bit of outside noise, but don't expect complete silence. Basically, if someone 5 feet away from me is talking at a normal conversational level, with music playing I can still tell that they are talking but I can't hear them well enough to tell what they are saying (I've received more than several irritated responses from my wife when asking her ""what did you say?"").

These have become my go-to headphones for general everyday listening. I'll reach for one of my more expensive sets if I really want to relax and sink into some good tunes, but these are more than adequate for just about everything else. I have a pair of the (discontinued) Amazon Basics headphones that I use every day at work, and honestly I think these sound better. If those ever break, I will absolutely be buying another set of these to replace them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I love how they are flexible and you can turn the ear pads out and adjust them to your ear or lift one forward and the other one on your ear if you need to. Sound so far has been great, at the very beginning there was some feedback issue with the built in microphone when I used it on my computer but since then it's been working just fine. There isn't a volume control on the headset itself, but I don't mind that and have found that other products that have this can be finicky and not work as well or cause problems. One change I'd make to improve it would be to make this product but with a flat cord so it would be even more portable and easy to store/carry around. Other than that, it's been awesome.

Very compact and easy to store and carry around.  The speakers have an ample range of movement.
The sound is crisp and has a pretty good bass.
They are very comfortable even for a person that wears eye glasses but after several hours it starts to hurt (glasses) which is no fault of the headset.  I usually have to take a break with other headsets (even more expensive ones) after 1 hour.
It is compatible with the XBox One adapter and controllers with the 3.5mm jack as well as the PS4.  The sound when playing is perfect and it is a very good alternative to expensive brands.
The connector has a metallic shell that protects the wire from pulls and bends which is a definitive plus.
The padding is good but does not go over your ear unless you have tiny ears.

Cons:

The microphone is in the wire and it normally doesn't fall in the direction of your mouth, sometimes people might not hear you loudly but so far, it has worked without issues when I play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

1. The cord is too long. Personally I would have it be 8inches shorter. Listening to music with my phone in my pocket, the cord would catch on things very easy. Kinda annoying having to babysit the cord.
2. After 30mins the headphone make my ears feel sore. Not sure if this could be fixed in headphones. Personally wouldn’t buy again. I’d just get the Sony headphones.

The cord has a fray protection on the jack portion, which is extremely nice for kid use, the sound quality was better than many more expensive that I've tried, and I felt as if the balance of sound for music was surprisingly good. The rotating ear muffs make putting them in a drawer easy, and the adjustable head band is perfect for a variety of ages. The noise cancelation for this type of headset was about average - some noise leaks out at higher level, and I could definitely still hear my four year old on the floor next to me - but perhaps my four year old is just extra noisy. ;-) In addition, I wasn't looking for a superb job of noise cancelation, so I wasn't too concerned about that. Overall, I have to say, I was quite impressed and would definitely purchase them again, whether for music or audio books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Two broke as they were cheaply made, two had poor sound, and the fifth are expensive Bluetooth headphones which have decent sound but I use them strictly for TV viewing.

These headphones were cheaply priced at $14.99 and had great reviews so I thought I would try them out. As it turns out these are the best sounding headphones I have ever used! I don't say that lightly. I am very picky when it comes to sound. The tones are rich and the bass is amazing. I have to keep the volume low because of the amount of power they produce. Rock music sounds incredible with these!  I can actually feel the bass which hasn't happened with any of the headphones I've used. They also do a great job with filtering outside noise. Currently I live near very noisy neighbors and usually with headphones on I can still hear them which drives me nuts. I like to listen to music to escape and just clear mind so noisy neighbor ruin that. These headphones totally blocks them out. You can truly get lost in your music or videos without outside distractions.

There is only one negative but it's minor for me. They are a little loose compared to other headphones I've used but they stay on my head so it's fine.  It's possible if I was to move around a lot with on they could slide back. They are comfortable so it doesn't bother me and sometimes tighter headphones could cause a headache anyway. So really not a big deal unless you have a tiny head.

Overall I love these headphones and all the positive reviews are right. I am stunned that such a good pair of headphones are this affordable.  I may get another pair just in case I accidentally break these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Not too bad for the price and how they looked.
Here's the pros and cons, in my opinion:
Pros:
- Good Sound Quality
-  Able to hear/make calls on phone.
Cons:
- Didn't had a case (Minor)
- Doesn't have an portable aux like wire to pull in/out and carry. (Minor)

I couldn't describe about the noise cancellation because I'm divided on where its at. But I can give an explaination: if you're in a place that's loud, turn up the volume, or if it is quiet, make it sound at a right spot, but have some care with the eardrums as well.

Bottom line: I'm digging these headphones, they are the best with what you only expect but I myself love them. High recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

My only complaint is that personally the actual ear cushions are a bit small for me, so they press on the tips of my ears in a way that makes them a bit sore. It's a very minor setback, though.

On the issue as the volume control is a little hard for little kids to figure out on their own, my kid ends up pausing his stuff more than turning it down, but don't let that stop you from buying it you just need to show them how to do it don't expect them to know how to do it on their own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was hesitant about the price, but saw that these mostly had 4-5 star ratings. So far, these have lived up to those user reviews on Amazon.

For the very generous price (and small packaging), this is a great set if you need something inexpensive but adequate for your basic listening needs. If you are not demanding a $50-100 quality headphones, this will get the job done as a backup. The fold-able design makes these really easy to store in something like a backpack or laptop carrying case. The metal case around the 3mm jack looks sturdy enough so that piece won't be torn as easy a year or two later like earbud pairs. The sound quality impressed me the most for some thing this cheap. As advertised, the bass is actually good. My daughter immediately tested them out while playing Minecraft, and she was able to hear her friends, the game, and was able to talk clearly to them through voice-chat.

One last thing: This set would be perfect if you are needing multiple pairs for computer stations at a school room or library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These worked fine for me.  I was able to listen to what I wanted and couldn't really hear all the craziness of the airport.
The only reason for the -1 star is because with wearing glasses, it did put a little pressure on my head in that area and they would begin to hurt after a while.  I'd have to adjust about every 10 - 20 minutes to stop it from hurting.

The ear cups are soft, so they don't hurt my ears from pressing my ear into my glasses (like my Skullcandys used to do) and it fit my head very well, which I was concerned about from other reviews.

They're not noise-cancelling, which is huge for me. Noise-cancelling headphones make me anxious. I can hear my audio clear as a bell, but if something happened in the house or my fiance needed me and was calling me, I could hear him.

The cord and plug are very high quality materials, the cord won't tangle and the plug will last a long time, but isn't uncomfortable because there's a spring that supports the cord (I thought that might be more rigid, but it's not and I'm glad)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The cord also has a wire spring to keep from bending, which is nice and not something you always find in headphones at this pricepoint.

The piece that connects to your device, as well as the inch of wire leading from that piece are reinforced with a metal housing and flexible metal piece (on the wire).  The headphones fold flat to save space and avoid breaking them (which is what happened to my last ones--different brand--when the ear piece got caught on my tote bag).  These do not completely cancel all noise, which I like, because I want to be able to hear what's going on around me, especially when I'm out for my daily walk.  The sound quality is good, markedly better than the headphones these are replacing.  The only down side is that they're a little big for me.  They don't fall off, but they don't fit my head snugly.

I decided to make a switch from using earbuds to this because they kept getting messed up. These headphones are of a very high quality. They cancel out annoying background noise and amplify your music. I also find that it has great volume control that allows for you to find the most comfortable volume for your individual needs. The sound quality is amazing. The best I have ever experienced music wise. Lastly, they are very sturdy. The wire is thick and strong and I love the coiled metal piece at the end.

It would have been just as easy to make the smallest setting smaller to accommodate everyone, since you can always adjust it to be bigger.

I use these at work to toss around, watch Youtube, etc., not for anything like serious music listening, so my requirements are pretty limited.

The headband band is fully padded. The cushions have decent faux leather, not the papery stuff. They fold up easily but feel sturdy while worn. They are fairly large (Amazon Basics brand is small by comparison, the headphone band snapped in a few months of moderate use). They even look decent.

The sound quality is honestly pretty bad, they are very bassy, muddy, and unbalanced. I really can't imagine how people are saying the audio quality of these is good compared to anything else. If you're listening to music, I would try upping your budget to something decent. If you just need a serviceable pair of cheap, decently comfortable on-ear headphones for Youtube or voice chat or something, they're serviceable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

With the volume on a reasonable level they drown out my husband talking in the background, which he does a lot. They fit comfortably and don't put pressure on my ears. Overall, I'd buy these again.

I've become accustomed  to a 5.1 system with a sub woofer, center unit, and 4 satellites with a total of 11 speakers between them. I tried using my phones earbuds but quickly gave it up as a bad job and went shopping for something better. I was planning on spending $70 to $100 for a ""professional quality"" headset but the low price and high rating of the Vogek's caught my attention. After reading all the glowing reviews I decided what the heck? It's only $12.95, no more than a decent set of earbuds. I can always use them with my laptop. When I tried them for the first time I was astounded! The headphones far exceeded my modest expectations.

PROS: High quality construction, very comfortable, Outstanding sound quality, microphone works well with VOIP applications, sound isolation is good considering they are on ear not full covering headphones.
CONS: (1) No operating instructions are provided. If it weren't for the product pictures  on Amazon I would never have figured out the mic. and playback controls (Pictures are available at vogek.com as well). (2) No volume control (not a big deal, just use the volume control on the device you're connected to.

The last pair I used and enjoyed was probably 15 years ago. I have preferred earbuds ever since. But after reading about the lack of sanitation that comes with earbuds used regularly, I decided to find some cheap headphones. And then I stumbled upon this product. Boy, am I happy I decided on this. When I get tech, I try to stay out of the sub-$20 region because there's usually a reason as to why it is so cheap.
These headphones, though, I don't know why. The cord, the softness of the padding, the incredible noise-cancellation, these could easily be $40-50 and it would be reasonable. The bass in songs and videos (such as ASMR videos) is great. The metal tip and covering on the jack connector, that seems like that could take a beating and still have no wiring issues. I had to do some classwork in a public space recently due to a power outage at home, and with my music going at a low volume, I heard absolutely nothing from the folks nearby and the cafe music overhead. Zilch. Nada. Not a single sign of life noticed outside of my laptop and personal space.
I will admit, I have not tried the microphone aspect of it, but even for having an extra like that, it's not in the way. It's there, it's noticeable when I'm unwinding the cord, but it's virtually unnoticed when I'm using the headphones like normal.
When I'm done using these for a while, they fold up with no issues whatsoever. They don't feel cheaply made, so I'm not worried about folding them up and having them break mid-process.
And best of all, nothing goes in the ear itself so there's no sanitary concerns like earbuds get. Seriously, these are an absolute steal for the quality and price. Vogek, you designed a winning product right here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These headphones rock.","October 24, 2019","I've only had these headphones for about a week, there are already superior to everything else I have.
The sound quality is great, the noise reduction is awesome, and they fold into a number of configurations to easily store in a messenger bag, laptop bag, or luggage for traveling. For the price and quality these headphones pretty much cannot be beaten.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Edwards","Great headphones for the price","September 15, 2019","My 12-year old daughter, whom I bought these for says these headphones are great!  We had gone through a three similar noise-cancellation headphones, all of the same model, by a famous brand-name company (I won't say which one), and those headphones were about $30 each, but for each one, the jack broke off in her iPad after a couple weeks.  I got fed up and decided to give these ones a try.  So far, so good!  My kiddo likes them and she says the sound quality is good, so there you have it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Along with few cheap ones from Amazon to go work out. I bought these for work because I want to let people know I have headphones on and they dont need to talk to me. I previously bought a pair of Marshall from Nordstrom but the connection was sensitive and sound was cutting in and out so I returned it and got these. These are so much better","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Lightweight-Portable-Fold-Flat-Microphone-Black/product-reviews/B07MCCJ6VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
