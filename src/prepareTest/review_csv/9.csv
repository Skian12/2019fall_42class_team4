They're comfortable to wear and although it's only been a few days I haven't gotten tired of wearing them yet. The sound is pretty good (I don't know much about headphones though, tbh) and I would definitely buy them again if I had too. I like the color of them and how the cord doesn't tangle either. Easy to store as well.

Is there anything wrong with them?  No, I am just prone to losing earbuds or misplacing them so I've bought several pairs over the last few months.  These are definitely the best bang for the buck for earbuds.  I've bought ""bargain headphones"" from name brands at the drug store and they sound lifeless.  These earbuds produce a nice full sound, not too much bass and an even spectrum across all frequencies which is good for music and podcasts.  It's a great all around earbud.  The flat cable is also nice to prevent tangles as I store them in my pocket and they never knot up.  I wouldn't expect audiophile quality but you definitely get what you pay for and then some.  My only suggestion would be to make the L and R on the earbuds more visible b/c at first I had them reversed and I could barely make them out.  Overall, I'm very pleased and will probably be purchasing again once I leave another pair on the train.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Tangle-Free-Ergonomic-Headphones-Compatible-More-Black/product-reviews/B07S82CYLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But headphones can be a bit on the bulky side, especially if you want music while going out for a walk/jog. These little earbuds produced a surprising amount of sound, and were quite clear. There was no problem with them staying in my ears as the earbuds themselves are angled a bit. The padding that was on the earbuds by default fit my ears just fine, but the box does include a couple of different sizes to accommodate different people. Overall, I was happily impressed with the sound quality of these earbuds. Plenty of cord is given so I never felt as though I was pulling them out of my ears. And I must say, the red and black color scheme of the earbuds is a rather sharp touch. Will probably pick up another pair at some point!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Tangle-Free-Ergonomic-Headphones-Compatible-More-Black/product-reviews/B07S82CYLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Like the sound quality for the price, tangle-free which is the first thing my hubby noticed, there is no volume control as they are just earbuds, so technically there should be a n/a for that section, hence the 3 stars. We did not want noise cancellation, but when in the ear, it's enough to suit our needs. We like the flat cord as it keeps it tangle-free, the earpieces are definitely designated left or right ear with a symbol on the earbud. I however did not see it till months later, I just recognized by feel which bud goes in which ear. Later I switched the silicone pieces to slightly smaller for my ear canal, replacing the right one with a white ear tip=""right, white"" and the left one is black= ""bLack, Left"".

During the hot days when I would have my Air conditioner turned on the headphones  silenced most of the sound. It comes with additional buds which is always a plus. The only problem Ive had with the headphones so far is that it does get a little tangled. I do not own an earbud case so I would wrap it around and put it in the box after using it.

Like others have said, the sound quality is fantastic for how cheap it is--bass in particular comes through much clearer than even more expensive models I've tried. Noise cancellation is also unusually good if that's what you're looking for. The earbuds are comfortable and durable, and come with four (!!) extras in case you lose them. The one thing I wish was better was the cord, which is rather thick: every time I jostle it by accident, the vibrations are amplified quite a bit through the earbuds, and makes things like running/exercising in these less ideal. Still definitely recommend for studying, relaxing, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Tangle-Free-Ergonomic-Headphones-Compatible-More-Black/product-reviews/B07S82CYLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Valdez","Vogek Earbuds:  Incredible Quality and Value","September 19, 2019","I was looking for a simple and inexpensive set of earbuds for my child (with no microphone nor phone control) that she could use with her tablet in the car.  I found a nice set of “Amazon’s Choice” Vogek Earbuds for eight dollars, which led me to these through the “Compare with similar items” panel.  This version of the Vogek Earbuds seemed to have all of the same features as the other set, but were on sale for six dollars.  It arrived the next day and we immediately tried them out.

The 9 mm neodymium driver units do give these earbuds better bass than most earbuds you’d find at the store.  They have great quality sound – maybe not quite as good as my $50 earbuds, but as good as or better than any $20-$30 earbud I’ve bought in the past.  These also feature a “Slim & extended 3.5mm connector” that allows the connector to go through the case cutout of your phone or tablet without getting blocked from fully seating.  I use Bluetooth enabled earbuds, so this is a feature I didn’t even consider in the past and think it is worth mentioning.

These were love at first sight with my daughter and I highly recommend these Vogek earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

One thing I will particularly note in its difference from other earbuds is the shape. I always get ergonomic, and these ones are more bent than normal. At first I was wary, simply because of the change from normality, but it really is just as, if not more comfortable than that traditional curved shape that many ergonomic earbuds are made in.

Concerning sound, it is actually a lot better than I thought it would be for the price. I tested them with a couple dozen songs from Spotify, including heavy bassed songs. One thing I noticed is the nice quality in general, not just the bass. I think part of that is due to the shape and outside sound-blockage. I bought two of them hoping they would be good, and they are even better than expected!

One last note: for me, earbuds don't generally last too long, more than 6-8 months at best. That is why ten bucks is awesome, because I don't want to spend 50 on earbuds that are not incredibly different in quality, if they are going to break (which happens every time for me) so soon. It's only ten bucks. Try it out. Why not?","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I saw the reviews and knew they were most likely going to be relatively good for the price, but actually experiencing the product made me so happy I made the choice to buy these.
  The sound quality on this pair of earbuds is very clear and consistent and even has very nice bass control, allowing me to turn it up to high volumes without hearing any deterioration sound. Not only so they sound great for the price, but they also look pretty neat! They may not have the volume/call control buttons on one of the wires, but that doesn't really bother me because they are only $6 and I don't need the buttons anyways. Lastly, no matter how hard I try these earbuds either won't tangle, or untangle whatever small tangled section easily, relieving any worry and annoyance that these earbuds will get tangled while having them in my pockets. These are amazing for the price, beating out even some $20 earbuds I've purchased in the past!

The sound quality on the Walmart buds was awful, even to my very-novice ears. But the reviews on these were good, so I figured it was worth a shot.
The bad (which is not awful): I don't love the color. And the buds themselves are at an unusual angle, and that's going to take some getting used to. But that's it, as far as I can tell, for the bad.
The sound quality is certainly acceptable (again, I don't have a discerning ear, but I was able to tell the cheap Walmart buds were bad). The fit is fine, and it comes with two spare sets of ""pads"" in different sizes (I have not tried those).
I have no hesitation in recommending these to someone looking for an inexpensive pair of earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

They stay in my ear very snugly but are still completely comfortable, which is great because usually most earbuds don't like to stay in my ear with the way it is shaped, I guess. But yeah even with the jolting impacts fo running they stay in nicely, even better than my old ones. They don't cancel noise out as much as my old ones (I used to use them for sleeping in when my environment was too loud to fall asleep in), but if you have music playing it shouldn't be a problem. I listened to music with them as well and they have great volume. I can't speak for the quality from the standpoint of an experienced audiophile or anything, but it sounds nice to me :)

The only thing left to see will be how long they last. They seem pretty well built, with the flat cords and that they don't hurt your ear to wear. If they break faster than usual I will make sure to update this review, but it looks like they should last quite a while.

Today is Oct/14/19 and five months later, these headphones are still holding up... I love the design of allowing the earpods (buds) to lay flat in your ear, giving them a more comfy fit without always popping out of your ears.

I read some of the reviews stating that it's hard to add the little rubber ear protection pieces on the earpods (buds)..

I can help you/I'll explain how..

Sense the earpods (buds) design is flat instead of round you'll need to pinch the rubber protection pieces to get them to fit the earpods (buds) correctly..

That's it, that simple, an they'll fit..

Recap:

Pinch rubber protection piece before placing them on earpods (buds).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Tangle-Free-Ergonomic-Headphones-Compatible-More-Black/product-reviews/B07S82CYLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was expecting tinny sound or tunnel-sound considering the price. I'm very happy that the headphones so far exhibit sound quality as good as that of headphones much more expensive. The tones seem accurate to me with respectable--but not cloying, exaggerated--bass. These headphones work terrific not only for listening to movies but also music where sound fidelity is critical.

I also really appreciate the flat cord. It really does retard tangling. And the dual red-black color adds some pizzas to what could be another boring black headphone set. I used the ear inserts already attached to the headphones and they're perfect for me. Very comfortable. I don't anticipate any problems wearing these for hours. And while I don't expect to wear them while exercising, I think they'd be stable anyway. For sitting around working and listening to music, the ear pieces stay in without any of the annoying drooping of heavier sets. And since there are no other gadgets on the headset--like active noise cancellation boxes or call-management systems--the whole set is very light.

I just turned the track I'm listening to on my Iphone up 3/4-to-max. No crackling, distorting. Great! And the sound is still crisp, the silences between tracks enveloping. Oh, and the set comes with a tiny (1.5 inches) velcro tie that's perfect for bundling the headset for travel--a very nice touch most other companies never include. Terrific price for a good set of basic headphones that perform surprisingly well. I may just purchase another to keep as a back-up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

My last pair broke and I didn’t have $16 to shell out for another pair that would probably break in 6 months. Saw the positive reviews on these and although skeptical because of the price being almost half that of Skullcandy’s, I decided to buy these Vogek ones. Started some music, IMMEDIATELY happy! I’ve never had ergonomic earbuds before so the feeling is a little weird but not bad. As for sound, I would say these are a force to be reckoned with, a strong competitor for Skullcandy. Love love love these! I can’t speak for the durability yet since I got them less than 10 minutes ago, but so far so good.

Update: Unfortunately, they have already stopped working in the left ear. The durability is next to none I suppose, since I never stepped on them or bent the wires weirdly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Just one thing to be aware of.","November 5, 2019","Even though I own many pair of headphones (wired, and bluetooth), I still buy them once in a while.
I especially like to buy headphones with cheap price to use as spare.  For instance, I would throw them in the pocket of the jacket or in a bag.  In case I need to wait for something while being outside, I can use the headphones.  And I don't have to worry in case I lose them.  On the other hand, I would be very concerned to lose expensive headphones.  (I own Sony one that costs $100)

Regardless, this pair sounds decent.  The cord length is long.  I can listen to music with my cellphone being inside my winter jacket.  The greatest feature is the shape of the ear tips.  They are in curve shape and they are comfortable to fit in your ears.  Once you try it out, you would know what I mean.

How about drawback?  One.  But I wouldn't blame it.  This pair is straightly headphones and it does not have microphone to be use for phone call.  If you looking for a headphone for phone call, you need to look elsewhere.  Still, for this price, I wouldn't expect that much.

So, this the one thing buyer needs to be aware of.  There is no microphone for phone call.

Bottom line, this pair go to pocket of my winter jacket.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Tangle-Free-Ergonomic-Headphones-Compatible-More-Black/product-reviews/B07S82CYLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

This time the price of these earbuds caught my attention. I went with the previous reviews and decided to buy two of them. I should say, I've no regrets. I'm no audiophile, but having gone through many of these earbuds, I had a certain expectation, even at this price range. The build quality seemed solid, and the audio quality is comparable to the ones that I've spent at least three times as much. Can't speak for noise cancellation as I didn't buy them for that purpose, and have used in such conditions.

I usually listen to music and podcasts during workouts/jogging and sweat a lot. I hope these buds will hold up to the rapid movent and sweat.

The do not support volume control, microphone.  You can use your device to control the volume but there is a microphone and I can talk on the phone with these earbuds and everything, and the call clarity is just as good, if not better than my $300 bluetooth.

Great sound for the value.","November 15, 2019","I usually expect the quality I pay for in a product. These earbuds were a pleasant surprise compared to the price. I experienced a sound quality that is usually attained in the upper range headsets. I own the Sony 1000XM3 and the Bose 700. I love them both but neither of them feels as comfortable in my ears while I sleep. The other good thing about these headphones is they will never die on you due to battery. That's the reason why I wanted a wired set.

The unique design allows you to quickly identify the left vs right side so you don't have to read the tiny font. The cable feel strong and sturdy. I dropped my phone and I caught it by the cord like I was fishing, right before it hit the floor.  If you are looking for a good set of wired earbuds for your kids or yourself, these are a must-have.

It comes in this cigarette sized cardboard box and in it are some ear tip changers (Different sizes). For $5.99, you get crazy value for the money, should definitely consider purchasing these.

Fleming","Work well","October 5, 2019","These have a nice shape to the ear pieces and come with a choice of small, medium, or large foam pieces. They plug into my Android phone and the machines at the gym just fine. They seem well made enough. The sound quality is fine -- a real audiophile would probably find it lacking, but they're probably paying a lot more for their earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Tangle-Free-Ergonomic-Headphones-Compatible-More-Black/product-reviews/B07S82CYLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Since the price was right, I ordered a set from Voget.
They arrived quickly, packed in a small cardboard box.  The package included the earbuds and three sets of earpads.
The earbuds are quite attractive, and the stress relief provided at the earpieces and connector ensures long life.  The cables are flat to minimize tangling.
These earpieces fit well and can be worn for long periods before they become uncomfortable.
Volume—controlled by my MP3 player—can be adjusted quite loudly without distortion.  Sound quality is surprisingly good for an item in this price range.  I would have no hesitation in purchasing another product from this company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""
