I purchased these in the Rose Gold color and appreciate that Bose offers a color apart from the usual black and silver.  I'm not up on all the features and intricacies of this technology, but what I can share is that there is a significant difference in what you're able to hear/not hear as soon as you put them on.  I put them on while the volume on my tv was in the 20-25 range and although the noise cancelling feature was on high, I was still able to clearly hear the speaking coming from the tv, just at a much lower volume--comparable to hearing a quiet conversation in the background and just enough to eliminate it as a distraction.  Once I started to play music, the sound from the tv was totally eliminated and I heard sounds, tones and acoustics I had never heard before--the clarity of the music and melody was much more apparent.  As I mentioned, transformational!  I can't wait to try them out on a long flight!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

You can say it is a minor cosmetic issue, but it is annoying on a brand new product.  Anyway, here is my brief review of this product.

1.  These headphones are very comfortable to wear, but when the noise callenation is turned on, I feel a weird pressure sensation and minor pain in my ears.
2.  The iOS app is minimalistic and there is no EQ adjustment option.
3.  The volume is way too low.  I have to crank it up to 85-90% to achieve what decent earphones put out at 60%.  (Btw, I have a very good hearing and never use excessive volume when listening to music.)
4.  The system voice has a horrendously funny accent.  Everytime it connects to my iPad, it makes me giggle.
5.  The biggest problem is the poor audio quality.  Everything just sounds very flat and unremarkable.  High and mid range sound very dull and muted and bass is just average.  Shockingly, the sound quality of these $300 headphones is comparable to the $10 Apple earphones that came with my iPhone.
6.  Multi pairing is very convenient when swapping between an iPhone and an iPad.  You don’t have to disconnect and reconnect the bluetooth connection, but sometimes it gets confused and wouldn’t play from the correct source device.
7.  Nice clicky physical buttons for controls.
8.  Bose should have killed the Micro USB.  Micro USB is DEAD.

Here is my score for Bose QC35 II and Sony 1000XM3.  I have owned both and this is my subjective opinion.
Bose QC35 II (9.5/9.5/10/5/8)

The headphones are an embarrassment at $300. I've used various $50 headphones that have 100 times the reliability of these Bose headphones when it comes to keeping a bluetooth connection. I initially bought both these and the Sony XM3s with the intention of comparing sound/fit/noise cancelling/etc. I haven't even tried out the XM3s yet (I'll update this after I do), but regardless, I will be returning the QC 35 II no matter what.

Here's how my hour of usage has gone. Opens box, connects headphones to phone in 30 seconds. Good start. Noise cancelling is great. Sound is good, but not too much better than some cheaper pairs of headphones I have. Then I proceed to walk 10 feet away from my phone and the connectivity starts to cut out. At 15 feet it disconnects completely. WTF is this? So I unpair headphones and restart everything. Maybe it was a fluke. Nope...the range on my pair of headphones is literally 10 feet. Pretty unbelievable.

I routinely use 3 other bluetooth devices with my phone and I've never experienced connectivity issues.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

At this particular campus the HVAC system is very loud, making it hard to concentrate on my work. After researching about Bose and their high reputation in noise cancellation, I knew that I had to try this product out.

Once I received this pair of headphones, I was immediately blown away at the noise cancellation performance, and reminded of how much my ears ring. 95% of the sound I was exposed to during my study sessions were now gone, making my sessions much more productive than before.

In terms of sound quality, I have heard from Sony users that their product is superior in sound quality compared to bose, with much deeper bass. If that is your main concern, I would consider researching that product to determine if that fits your needs. However, Bose has tremendous bass and the highs and lows hit just fine for my liking!

For gaming, I use these mainly to chat in discord with friends, but the ""in game"" sounds are very similar to a High-end pair of Astro headphones, if that means anything. Overall, I rate this product 5 stars, as I am still impressed with the performance in noise cancellation, audio quality, battery life, and durable build quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I’ve had them for a year and 8 months and they’re still working great. I got them to help concentrate in a loud, open floor plan office and they do cancel out a lot of noise. Now I wear them while walking my dog and I really don’t hear anything around me. They connect easily, I wish they didn’t connect to multiple devices at once because that only makes things more complicated- you can only really be connected to one at a time or another device might interfere. I’ve also had a few instances where the headphones have worked improperly and started picking up ambient noise from my surroundings, or the audio gets fuzzy, but that is not a common occurrence.

Fraley","Great noise cancelling, comfortable fit","August 13, 2019","I was thrilled at how comfortable and light-weight these headphones are!  I purchased them primarily for air travel, as the drone of the engines really irritates me.  I was expecting some neck stiffness due to wearing these for six hours, but they are so comfortable I've had no problems at all.

I also had the opportunity to wear these at night (in a dorm for a conference, and construction started outside before 6am!).  Again, I was amazed I could sleep with these on, and still get a good night's sleep, even laying on my side.

The sound reproduction is very good--nothing like studio headphones (Sennheiser HD 650s or the like), but certainly way better than any ear buds.  There are now more choices out there than when I bought mine (others have temporarily taken the noise cancelling crown, or sound a little better), but these are still worth serious consideration due to comfort (and the noise cancellation and sound aren't bad either!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Bought them for travel on airplanes.  Noise reduction freak'n excellent.  All the noise is cut out but yet I can hear the announcements.  Use them to watch TV also.  The only down side to these things is for Apple products, you can only have two devices enabled to be connected to them.  So if I want to use my iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV, one of these I have to disable and then when traveling switch to the devices I have with me; this (feature) is active no matter what device you are using to connect to the headphones.  So for the iPhone and the iPad, you need a Bose app to configure the headphones.  The app is the same for each device.  Each app will only allow you to connect to two devices and they are the same for each device if this makes sense.  This must be a limitation of the headphones and I can't figure out why there would be such a limitation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The moment you make a call, the noise canceling turns off and you (and whoever you're calling) will hear everything around you – amplified – while you're on the phone. It's so bad that I have to use my old QC25 wired headphones for calls (which work perfectly for this), and only use the QC35-S2's for wireless listening to music/podcasts/tv while doing other things. This is beyond ridiculous for headphones of this price.

As for their performance purely as listening devices, the noise canceling is slightly (but only slightly) better than the wired QC25's, but the tonal range is slightly worse in the base tones. Their ability to connect to multiple devices is great, but suffers from a tendency for them to want to connect to multiple devices AT ONCE (iphone + something else, for instance), which about half the time causes no audio to be played through them at all, even though the source is muted when they're selected. You then have to remove them from each device you've paired them to, and start over to get sound back.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Bose is all about comfort, as the name suggests it is built around the policy of supreme comfort, a factor that the MX1000x can't even come close too. Within 30 seconds of wearing the sonys in bestbuy, my ears began to burn and felt the nauseating sensation of a headache growing... and that was only after 30 seconds of listening. Bose on the other hand, even in those few seconds of testing at BestBuy - I could barely tell that I had a pair of headphones on my head.

So Bose wins comfort, and i think everyone can agree on this... but that's really about it. Sony has far better noise canceling, you should have seen my face when I pressed the calibration button in BestBuy (and as loud and busy at it was, and i didn't even have music playing) it was dead silent. And dead silent in a way, where even my own excited squeals of laughter were invisible. It was truly like being deaf, unable to hear a thing and nothing was even playing yet. Upon turning on the tunes though, aside form the neddle-like precision of notes, I felt something was missing from them. It was a strange feeling, and I think its the fact that the MX1000x are so good at separating sounds from one another, that music sounds sort of hollow when you really listen to something. It can turn a symphony into a bland practice session, because it's so good at separating notes.

QC35 on the other hand, left something to be desired on the noise canceling ability. The loud roar and chatter of bestbuy, became a dull to silent roar, with most sounds around me muffled out. With all music and sounds turned off I would rate the BOSE as more a ""Sound Dampening"" headphone, than a true noise cancelling headphone (at least when compared to the technology of Sony). Still when turning on the music the sound felt full. My face was shocked at the clarity of the notes produced by these headphones. music had feeling with these on, tension, emotion - something I felt the precision of the Sony's sort of took away. The music sounded more like a symphony, than a audiophile picking apart every single note and separating them so you could hear it individually (as the sony's did). This lead me to hear that the BOSE produced better sound to my ears with the test tracks provided. However using truely uncompressed audio, you will be able to hear much more notes and instruments with the MX1000x.

Reviewers constantly raved about how the Bass on the MX1000x was much better than the QC35, but to be completely honest I don't really hear that at all. I've ramped up my QC35 against a friends MX1000, and I prefer the Bass tones of my Bose over his, every time (even with uncompressed audio). Even the sound quality of the Bose I sort of prefer, even with the clarity that Sony produces.

In the end Bose wins in comfort hands down, there is absolutely no equal in this regard and really the QC35's shining quality. As far as bass and music quality go... its really a toss up on what you prefer. Sony hands down has the best noise cancelling possible, but are extremely uncomfortable and will give you a headache from how close they placed the speakers to your ears so they get squished!

If i were placed in the same position again of buying either, I don't think there's any change I would have changed my purchase. However if the MX1000x had been as comfortable, I would own a pair of sony's instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They all had their strong points.  I finally broke the logjam by selecting according to what I wanted in a set, versus cool but unnecessary features that I would probably seldom use or need.  And as you can probably guess, I ended up selecting the Bose QC35s.

I recieved my QC35s within 48 hours or ordering from Amazon.  Upon opening the package I was both pleased and underwhelmed with a few features.  Let's talk about something good first.  The semi-hard case really rocks.  -Well-built and padded to keep the QCs relatively safe.  However, the provided USB charging cable was ridiculously short. Without measuring, I guess-timate the cord to be a out 8 to 10 inches.  The included headphone cable was less short but still a bit underwhelming in length.  Bose is a premium company, and for the price of entry to purchase these headphones, there is no reason why they could not include cables that are at least a serviceable length. Without checking, but having owned many Sony and Sennheiser headphones over the course of my lifetime, I'm willing to bet they would not make such a remedial mistake.

Fortunately, the QC35s made up for the cable issue with outstanding sound characteristics and excellent noise-cancelling capabilities.  The sound stage of these headphones is expansive.  I can hear separation between instruments that sounded muddled and undefined in my previously award-winning Plantronics. In fact, I would say that you probably would be hard-pressed to make a pair of headphones that were siginificantly better using a Bluetooth connection.  And that's just because you get to a point in sound quality that is really only limited by the Bluetooth standard.
As for the claims that I've seen in other reviews that these don't have any bass response, I will tell you that anyone that thinks these headphones don't have bass needs to immediately get their hearing checked. And anyone who needs more bass than these are capable of producing are probably causing themselves some real hearing damage.
In terms of sound quality, will these compete with my wired Sennheiser HD 380 pros?  No way.  Not even close.  In fact, any Bluetooth headphones I've ever tried, no matter how much money you throw at them will get stomped by a decent set of wired headphones. And that's just the reality of Bluetooth, until a new technology takes its place.

BUT what you're getting here is an excellent portable set of headphones that sound pretty sweet and have excellent noise reduction.  I ride the Washington DC Metro (subway) to work every day, and once I set the ANC and turn on the music, I never hear another sound other than the music.  They're also reasonably comfortable and actually fit my big ears and head very well too. Bose claims 20 hours of use from a single full charge and I am inclined to believe that figure.  I can charge them on Monday, and by week's end, I have ridden the train a combined 15 hours, and have plenty of juice left. If you've owned a decent set of Bluetooth headphones before, these probably won't blow you away, but they certainly won't disappoint either. Bose gets it right here, and I'd wholeheartedly recommend these to anyone looking for premium set of headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I did a little research on them and they were a bit too much but I figured I would get them at the $299 price.  I also saw that the SONY ones that are much like these were also on sale at $299.  Anyway, i ordered them and I got them Monday afternoon as promised.  Everything was in tact and no damage to the box or the headphones.  I opened them up and charged them up while I got ready for work.  I took them with me along with my iTouch.  I took my phone and downloaded the Bose+ app to my phone and went through the process of setting up and pairing it to my Galaxy 7.  It did not take long and it also had to download some firmware which did take a few minutes for it to download and then install to the headphones.  Once completed I walked through the features and it added Google assistant so I can use one of the buttons to initiate and ask Goggle assistant questions or have it do something.  They are very comfortable on my head and on my ears.  They don't cause any discomfort or stress out my ears after wearing them for a long period of time.  Just have to get use to the location of the buttons.  The Noise canceling is pretty good and you can turn it off if you like and save on battery.  I have yet to see how long the charge lasts in prolonged use.  Overall on my first use and test of it I really like them and glad I ordered them.  Well worth the money in my opinion.

I won't leave the house with these headphones... too expensive.  Neighbor was getting upset that my music was too loud one night.  So I needed a solution.  These bose headphones was it.  So here I am typing this while wearing the bose headphones with noise cancellation on.  I can't hear my fingers type/click on my keyboard.  I feel like i'm in an airbubble with nothing but music.  It's futuristic af.  I wan't to say they could be a little louder, but being in bands all my life around music pretty much shot my hearing anyways, so they're just fine.  They're comfortable af.  Ears don't hurt. Just what I wanted, over the ear.  I swear to God i was just about to write a bad review about the alexa feature not working after spending days without itworking, come to find out there's a dang button on the left! LOL,  so go ahead and buy em.  As a bose fan, I give them a 5.  price wise, you get what you pay for.  bluetooth is simple.  i don't know what nfc is, but it has that.  i'm able to have my desktop computer pair with my phone at the same time, so that's rad.  I can go from youtube videos on my computer to telephone calls on my phone with a hit of a button. Smart!  I still can't get over this noise cancellation.  I really do feel like I'm sucked in a box with nothing but music playing.  Can't hear nothing from the outside.  I've only charged this once and on my 4th day at 80%. with volume pretty high and noise cancellation on.  App is easy to use.  At least buy em, and if you don't like em.  return em.  You got 30 days and Amazon is good for it.  i love amazon so much.  Merry Christmas, folks!

UPDATE: BEST HEADPHONES EVER!  BEST THING I'VE EVER BOUGHT ON AMAZON IN THE PAST 2 YEARS! USE THEM EVERY DAY WHEN I GET OFF WORK.  NEIGHBORS ARE HAPPY!  SO GOOD!

The sound is great as well. However, Bose does not deliver on all functionality. The multifunction button does not work to pause/play or skip track on current version of Android on Pixel 2 or Google Pixel Chromebook. Plus, don't bother using it to make a phone call. The call quality is poor and there is a constant echo of every word you speak on both Android and the iPhone.

Update: After restarting my Pixel 2, the multifunction button works for pause play for now but, using this this headset for for making phone calls on Android or the iPhone is unusable. Unless of course you are calling yourself. Everything you speak into the microphone is repeated back in the headphone about a 1/2 second later. That wouldn't be so bad if the echo was faint. The echo is louder than the voice of the person you are calling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

DO NOT PURCHASE THESE! It was unimaginably bad!!! I've had the QC 25's for several years and use them in my home office to block out my neighbor noises. These QC 35's are basically like having your loud neighbors shouting in your ears! No matter what I did the talking wouldn't stop. The moment I opened the box I was excited to use them and get some work done but unfortunately the voice kept telling me I HAD to download the app and would not stop repeating every 60 seconds until the app was installed. I called Bose support and their suggestion was to turn off the headphones then turn them back on....voice still there. Also what kind of a suggestion is that? I also brought up the fact that the Bose rep here on amazon said you didn't need the app to use it, so why would it not let me use the headphones without the app?  They say that is incorrect, you do NEED to install the app (clearly, unless you want the voice yelling at you to install it). Ok fine, i'll install another unnecessary app on my phone. After spending so long with bose support and installing the app, my battery was drained, so I  plugged my phone into charge, then sat down to get some work done. The talking started again! The voice said it could not register the connection to my phone. My phone was too far away. All I wanted was noise cancellation, I wasn't trying to play music or do literally anything, just sit there in silence with noise cancellation and type on my computer and it would not let me. After that I had enough, I reboxed the headphones and sent them right back. I was excited to go wireless but it's not worth it when the item is not easily usable. I don't want to have my phone on and next to me every time I want to use these headphones. I travel a lot. Am I expected to keep my phone on during a 15 hour flight?

IN SUM:  These headphones are ONLY usable with the app turned on and your phone nearby to pair with. You cannot just use noise cancellation with no active phone. Of course I would like to use my bluetooth on my phone occasionally, but not every time I use these. I'm joining the rest of the world and buying the new Sony headphones. Bose is no longer what they were.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I especially appreciate the ability to pair with multiple bluetooth devices and swap between them by simply bouncing the power switch. It announces each device that it connects to by name.

I got these headphone to replace my Beats Solo wireless model 2 headphones that are utter garbage for noise cancellation and are now my at-work headphones. I am able to use an old pair of wired Bose QC 2s to mow the lawn but the Beats were terrible at blocking ambient noise and could not be used for lawn mowing. I expect the QC 35s to perform like my wired QC 2s in that respect but won't know until summer.

These Bose headphones are also far more comfortable to wear than the Beats Solo wireless 2s. The last time that I flew I noticed that I could wear the Bose for the entire flight but had to take off the over-ear Beats after about an hour to give my ears a rest.

Sound quality is great, although I cannot offer any technical review.

That said, I enthusiastically recommend these headphones over Sony's -- hands down, no contest, no questions asked.  Let me count the reasons:
* Idle timer that switches the headphones off to preserve battery (as opposed to running until the battery dies if you pause and forget to switch them off)
* Low battery warning (as opposed to just kind of turning off when the battery is out)
* Multiple-device compatibility, with one-button switching (as opposed to manually-disconnect-from-first-device-then-manually-connect-to-the-second switching)

Noise cancellation is good enough for my needs.  Assuming that the headphones are playing sound (at which point their noise cancellation will function optimally), they will dampen -- but not fully cancel -- loud ambient sounds (e.g., a screeching subway, loud PAs, traffic).  On the other hand, they do an excellent job of muting distracting noises, including nearby conversations, which makes them excellent supplements to a day of rigorous study.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But the voice notifications and beeps are deafening!!!  There is no way to turn them down.  I purchased this for noise cancellation and soft music.  When notifications come through, my reaction is to pull the headphones away from my ears because it is so piercing.  I have followed threads of others with the same complaint and Bose has provided no fix.  You can only turn off notifications, not lower volume.

Bose QC35 best sound quality
Surface failed to work with iPhone X and iPad Pro
Soundlink isn’t noise cancelling
All three have microphones that amplify ALL VOICES IN THE ROOM – fail
Turns out the Jabra 370 really is the best for office communications, but not for taming noisy office.

Our company just moved to a new open office design. That means no walls, no offices, all open space with desks, work stations and huddle areas. I had an office until we moved and was going from speakerphone to headphones. We are a global company thus video conferencing and VOIP con calls are constant on Zoom, Skype, WebEx etc.

I already have a Bluetooth wireless headset Jabra 370, it is “on the ear” with a boom microphone, I thought an “around the ear” would help better with the new noisy office. The Jabra 370 uses a USB transmitter and is pretty much tied to desktops/laptops.

Now, about my special circumstances, I have a hearing disability and wear a hearing aid and Cochlear Implant. For this review what that means is that I hear from things that sit on my ear rather then inside my ear and because I already have the hearing aids cannot wear an ear bud arrangement. I am an IT professional.

This review is of all three subject headsets:
1) Noise Cancellation for Other Party – (FAIL) that is, when on a call what does the other side hear? And here all three failed, on calls the other parties could hear voices from all across the office because the microphone arrays would pick up every voice in the room. For the QC35 weirdly it was only when I was speaking – deathly silent when I wasn’t, but the moment I began to speak all the other voices in the room came through loud and clear, very distracting to the folks on other end of the call, at one point they could hear a conversation 35 feet away very clearly that I couldn't hear because of the headset

2) Noise Cancellation for Wearer– The Soundlink is not noise cancelling (I thought all Bose were) and therefore, it cannot work in a noisy open office environment, the Bose QC35 did the best job of noise cancellation, the Surface okay
But about noise cancellation – Bose is made for like a plane non-voice noisy environment, in an open office where the “noise” is other people talking on phones or in groups, the Bose actually makes the problem WORSE by amplifying surrounding voices

3) Call Quality – all three had good call quality on Win10 bluetooth, but the Surface had terrible quality for other party on the iPhone X and iPad, the other end and con calls could not hear me like I was in a tunnel

4) Pairing - All three headsets paired easily with my Win10 Lenovo corporate laptop, Win10 Surface Book 2 personal laptop, iPad Pro and iPhone X

5) No boom microphone – all three use a microphone array in the ear cup rather than boom microphone, my voice was clear on all three, but other side said QC35 was best sound
But note other voices are picked up as well

6) Surround the ear – all three styles are designed to fit around the ear entirely instead of on or in the ear, I was worried about discomfort based upon other reviews and the Surface has small ear cups, but all fit well over my (somewhat) oversized Obama type ears. The Bose were the most comfortable, in a warm office I can tell the Surface would have a sweat issue

7) Sound clarity – all three had very good voice sound clarity, but the Bose QC35 did so with less volume turned up, volume of 8 – 10 for others while volume of 5 on Bose QC35 to hear the same thing

8) Interoperability – all three operated fine on all manner of video, voip, UCaaS and web calls

9) Multi-device – in theory all three are supposed to connect to both phone and computer for dual inputs, I guess to hear music and then take a call or conversation, in reality that is horrible because my VOIP calls were constantly interrupted by the alerts and messages from my phone, the headset was constantly switching back and forth, and once, my iPhone randomly began playing music during a VOIP con call

10) Digital Aid/Cochlear – all three work fine with digital hearing and BTE hearing aids, and Advanced Bionics Cochlear implant

11) Sound Quality – my focus was on voice clarity not music, all three have excellent sound quality, The QC35 the best, then the Surface and then the Soundlink, the volume on the QC35 did not have to go as high to get the same results as the other two","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

A big improvement over the 15's.  The bluetooth is very nice over having to use them corded (I wish airlines would start enabling bluetooth on their IFE's so you didn't have to break out the cord.  It's nice having the rechargable battery, I love the auto shutoff feature and noise control level they added.  They fold up nicely to fit in the case.  Sound quality if good.  I lost the cord one time on my 15's and it was expensive to replace and this cord looks like it's a simple audio cord like you would use to connect an external MP3 player to a car so should be very cheap and easy to replace if it's loss.

A couple small things I don't like is there no plastic business card/ID holder to place a business card or contact info in case the headphones get lost and there is no airline adapter (fortunately my QC15 had one and I am just going to use that and sometimes airlines will give you one).  Most airlines have the regular plugs but a lot of airlines use the two prongs in business and first class when they furnish the headphones (probably to deter people from stealing theirs) so you will need the adapter in these cases (I prefer these over the crappy airline ones).

I'd recomend these for anyone that flies once a month and does a lot of redeyes.

Decided to put out the extra $ for the noise cancellation, around the ear headphones by Bose.
Very happy.
While I had not yet experienced noise cancellation, that Bose technology is simply outstanding.
Note, it does not cancel out all sound. It appears to focus on certain frequencies, such as road noise & air vents (the hi end freq). Pretty much anything that has a shhhhh or hissing sound....gone.
A jet flew over me on take-off (around 1,000 feet), and I could just barely hear it. Amazing.
As for me, the bass is deep, rich and smooth. Crisp and tight treble, with full rounded mids.
Wireless works flawlessly, and I can't say enough about the build and materials of the product. Well engineered!
Battery life is just as advertised. A coworker of mine uses these, not only for music, but also as a functional tool to eliminate undesired sound, such as jet engine noise while taking a flight, the road noise from public transportation, and to create near silence during sleep. This prompted me to Google ""noise cancellation"" to try an understand how it all works. Fascinating!

While it was at the top of my price point (actually well over it), I splurged on my personal audio enjoyment. The ear cups are super comfortable, almost like there is some sort of gel in them. I will agree with a few other reviews in regard to the inside of the ear cups getting a little warm with extended use. But not really a problem for me.
The battery does last longer if you connect the cord and drop the Bluetooth (for a direct connection) , plus it sounds a little better, although most people may not notice a difference. Conclusion: Full satisfaction from this user. The rich sound of this Bose is at stellar level. Enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

For example, over the last four months, when the gardener revs his lawn mower motor or the parents next door scream at their toddler-aged children, I've put these on and the noise is reduced by 80%.

The sound quality is 2x better than Apple EarPods. If you're looking for the absolute best sound on the planet, this is probably not it. That being said, it does produce a sound that can vaguely be described as robust with bass performing very well on a sound quality test and treble not far behind. So, unless you're a sound engineer or hardcore enthusiast, I think sound quality is as good as you would need.

The headset is comfortable to wear— even 4+ hours at a time. There is padding on the ear cup, which I find to be quite nice, and on the headset that rests on your head.

Got it today and it’s absolutely gorgeous both in the look and feel. The “silver” is preferred color for these masterpiece.
As far as the sound is concerned, Bose knows the science behind the Acoustic Noise Cancellation (heard they have the best engineering team behind this invention) it totally separates and unwanted noise from your surroundings and gives you a clear and crisp sound.
It comes with three different Noise Cancellation modes/settings: High, Low, Off
You can choose/select/switch between these modes at a press of an action button situated on the left ear cup.
Right ear cup has three built in buttons, two for volume and one to pause or receive an incoming call.
The QC 2nd series comes with inbuilt Alexa and Google Assistance. So if you owe iPhone: you can actually have 3 services at your disposal: Alexa, Google Assistance, and of course Siri! You can use action button to switch between the selections. (have to download Bose app)
You’ll not go wrong with this choice. The closest to this is Sony WH1000. One time purchase and will last for years to come as it has Bose’s warranty and technical support.

Doloboff","Wow, Wow and Wow - Bose Knows (how to make outstanding headphones)!!!","July 18, 2019","I had a pair of Bose wired, noise cancelling headphones for several years, and they were my cans of choice when flying or otherwise in an environment with unimportant background noise.  With these wireless headphones, Bose hits the mark once again.  The music plays as it was recorded and mastered.  Isn't that what we all want?

Apparently not, given the success of Beats headphones, a marketing machine created by Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.  Beats headphones enhance the bass, to the point where I feel that I am trapped in a car with a driver who has the treble level but the bass turned up to the max.  If you MUST have overly-compensated bass in everything that you listen to, then Beats are for you.

But if you want clear sound, together with a package that lets you easily choose the amount of exterior noise cancellation, then these Bose headphones are your best choice (at least with a price point less than a nice used car).  You also get simple volume controls and easily found buttons to skip forward or backward on your song list.

I have not yet tried Bose AR, so I cannot comment on that aspect of these outstanding headphones.  I expect great things from Bose.

So you won't be wearing the hot Beats headphones.  Even the NFL, which has a marketing deal with Bose, has trouble preventing the players from wearing Beats.  The Beats headphones are part of a well-planned marketing machine, and Bose just isn't as ""cool.""  But if you want to hear the music the way the musicians and engineers want you to hear it, forget about what the market views as ""cool.""  Go with Bose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Something up front I think I should say about noise cancelling as there does seem to be a bit of a debate over it, is it does not block out all sounds and it does not muffle sounds equally, but for practical purposes it does do a very good job at noise cancelling striking a good balance of things and being most effective where it is needed the most to make an enjoyable listening experience.  At least this is my experience using this on a daily basis in many different environments.  I have noticed on airplanes I need to fine tune how the headset rests on my head for best results, but once finding the proper adjustment it is almost like I am in an isolation room.  Fantastic.

Overall I am seeing this as well worth the money, a big step up over a much older generation of this product line I had been using, and definitely a huge step up over what came with my phone.  I bought this right after upgrading my phone, so in the past week have found some issues were not the head phone's fault, but instead default sound settings I have since adjusted.  Also been getting more adjusted to the noise cancellation, which is really a great feature of this headset.

For some things I really like about this headset:
1. I have a huge head and this fits nicely on it; even covers my large ears comfortably.  Almost no over the ear headphones do this and I have looked far and wide.  My head is just too big for pretty much all except this particular line of headphones / headsets.  In the ear headsets irritate my ears after a while, causing my ear canals to swell up.  So having something tolerable let alone comfortable to the point that I almost forget they are on is a huge plus.  They also fit on my wife's normal sized head just fine, so it covers a wide range of head sizes pretty well.

2. The sound quality and frequency range is great.  While I would like frequency sliders in their app, the hard coded balance across the range is pretty darn good.  Some reviews say there is a different headset that sounds better, but especially after this latest update, I am having trouble finding room for improvement; it sounds excellent across the range, even deep bass.  The main limit I hit is a streaming service I use defaulted back to low quality when I upgraded my phone, so deep bass was crushed a bit and overall was not sounding as good as my home computer which has been the same machine for a while now (where I got the quality options set right a while back), but resetting the values and clearing the cache has fixed this issue.  Really with noise cancelling mixed in I am hearing a lot more detail that would normally get washed out from background noise and my desire to keep volume levels down in order to preserve my hearing.  Have the best of both worlds now.

3. In call sound quality is reported to be good across a number of calls now, even from the datacenter floor.  Especially considering this does not have a boom mic, that is pretty good.  I remember in the past getting a call on the datacenter floor with a lesser headset and nobody could hear anybody.  Then again they have been moving servers to the cloud and the remaining servers are running cooler with the reduced heat load on the CRACs and thus their fans have slowed a bit, bit it is still really loud in there, so both parties hearing loud and clear is pretty amazing.

4. The battery really does go the distance and I would venture to say the 20 hour rating would be for harsh use cases where my main use case is mellow office building use.  I am thinking more like 25 hours in an office.  I just love how my newer devices can just go and go on batteries, at least initially where in the past battery life started off too short an then quickly became frustratingly way too short.  Starting off with plenty of time I have some room to do some battery life extension tricks like limiting the charge window manually.  Now if this was something built into the product like what you can do with a Tesla car, that would be really nice as changing out batteries every two years or so, especially with how devices are built these days is a bit of a PITA and too often goes badly.

5.  For sound cancellation, I have to say there is something to be said for pretty much all of the ambient noise just going away and it just being dead silent.  Seems to weird some people out, but I think it is great.  Can still hear people talk and other loud sounds, but I seems to be rather muffled.  Also it seems to be good at figuring out what is white noise and clearing that out completely where some other frequencies that are more useful get through better.  Also love being able to walk down a busy street and hear my music, especially without having to sacrifice my eardrums in the process, especially as a lot of really loud noise around freeways and such are really muffled down.  Found in a noisy data center that if I were to go to the barber, they would work better, but still work quite well with the hair I have, just little bit of bleed through sound from the excess hair around my ears.  Pressing the headphones down causes things to get a lot quieter.  Plenty good for easy on the ear drum music listening while in the data center.  Have used for other things like muffling noisy power tools and having my wife watch her TV next to me and not be distracted by anything at all.  Beginning to think this could be the beginnings of a great relationship... Oh wait a sec.

My complaints so far are:
1. My #1 complaint is removed as it seems to have been fixed with the latest firmware update as I thought would be possible.  Star added back.  Thanks Bose!

2. I have noticed doors around the office that automatically slam shut while this headset muffles the higher frequencies, the lowest frequencies seem amplified and so it is like my head is getting hit with a sound pressure wave.  Been thinking about this more and I have been moving in the direction of what this does muffle, it does so well that what it does not effectively muffle seems quite loud as the ears adjust to the greatly reduced sound levels hitting them overall.

3. The radio antenna seems to be on the right side only.  Being a lefty I like putting my phone on the left side, but that just does not go well.  Have to use the right side when going for a walk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The decision is going to come down to your priorities.  Sony's headphones overall sound better, especially with dance or bass-heavy music.  If you have FLAC or ALAC tracks, you'll notice the Sony sounding better since they support the LDAC Bluetooth codec, which is more advanced and uses higher bandwidth than Bose,

However, if you're heavily invested in the Android ecosystem and need the headphones to travel, the Bose are more comfortable and have better controls as the touch controls on the Sony are hit and miss.  The built-in Google Assistant is actually very helpful once you learn it's capabilities.

So overall I give 4/5 stars since the sound technology is not as advanced as the Sony's but overall the best choice if you need a good home/work/travel solution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I ended up returning the Sony headphones. Here is my comparison of the two:

- Both have very good active noise cancellation (ANC)
- Both have good sound, although the Sonys probably have more base, which I personally liked
- Both come with an app you can install on your phone to configure them to an extent. The Sonys are more configurable, with an EQ and more granular noise cancellation.
- The Sonys have an adaptive noise cancellation feature that will change the ANC level based on where you are and what you are doing (e.g., sitting vs traveling). I personally don't care about this feature or find it that useful.
- I found the Bose to be more comfortable and easier to fold up put away. The Sony earpads weren't as soft, and the headphones clamped down on my head with more pressure.
- I found the Sonys to have more intense ANC overall. My ears are sensitive to ANC, and I get the feeling of having pressure in my ears with ANC enabled. That feeling was much less intense on the Bose, even on high, despite the Bose having very good ANC, which gave me the impression that the Sony ANC was more brute force and less accurate.
- The Sonys have neat touch controls for volume, play/pause, prev/next, etc. While it's a cool feature, it wasn't something I cared that much about, and I was often worried I was going to accidentally change something when taking the headphones off and on. I don't think the buttons on the Bose headphones detract from their looks.
- The Bose can connect up to 2 devices at once, which is pretty nice. I can be connected to both my phone and my laptop and seamlessly switch between them.

Ultimately I returned the Sony headphones because I found the Bose to be more comfortable. My biggest gripe about both pairs of headphones is they do not save your last ANC setting! I cannot believe this feature was overlooked. I don't plan on using ANC all of the time. If I turn the ANC to low or completely off, when I turn the headphones off and on again, it will reset to high. The Sony app even allows you to configure the ANC at a granular level and allows you to configure the ANC for different usage patterns when the adaptive ANC is on; however, those settings also didn't persist, making them basically useless. I found the Sony Android app to be pretty buggy in general. I would strongly prefer an actual physical switch for the ANC setting instead of just having the setting be software controlled.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Cote","Had to go wireless with iPhone X","May 22, 2019","So I broke down and went for the high end Bose QuietComfort 35 at close to $350, and then went for a second pair of Bluetooth devices, the SoundCore Spirit X Sports Earphones by Anker for about $30.  For sound quality alone, the Bose wipe out the Ankers, no surprise.  Comfort also is much better with the Bose, although the multiple earpieces with the SoundCore really are helpful.  Noise cancellation - I can weedwhack while wearing the Bose and actually hear the music!  So no question, the Bose, is the first choice to be on my head.  That being said, the SoundCore take a close second place.  Why?  Working out they are much cooler on my head!  I do a lot of yard work, and it doesn’t take much in 70 degree plus weather for the full Bose ear muffs to get too hot.  Also, there are many circumstances when sound blocking is a very bad idea, such as being out walking or running along any trafficked road, etc.  And sometimes having something not so obvious on one’s head isn’t a bad idea.  Yes, for $30 you don’t get mind blowing sound, but the SoundCore’s are respectively fine for listening to podcasts, news, and music when needing to be aware of the external environment.

Bose is the best for NC.","August 18, 2018","I have every QC generation that has been out there, and this one is top two due to the wireless feature.

Here’s a brief summary after a few months of use:

Pros:

- Wireless: living without cables is great! You don’t have to battling with tangled cables, or cables getting stuck around your things while you’re on an airplane.
- Battery life: I went back and forth between the US-Europe with one charge, so the 20ish hours is true and most of the times enough.
- Noise cancelling: the NC on this pair is good enough, most of the times work great and work at the level of corded QCs. Sometimes is useful to have the two levels option on, as you might want to use them in areas where you need to hear your surroundings. It works so good, that speaking over the phone might sound weird with no background noise.
- Firmware updates: Bose keeps posting updates for the firmware, so the performance and quality of connection improves over time.

Cons:

- Noise cancelling distortion: when I’m close to a window and the panels vibrate too much (landing), the NC causes a lot of white noise. Firmware updates have improved this, but it is still noticeable. So, if you like window seats, keep this in mind. In my opinion, the QC25 NC is the best from Bose.
- Cable needed: eventually, you will need a cable. Let’s face it, the airlines are slow to adopt and the backseat screens can only work with a cord... so make sure you don’t loose it or leave it behind! Also, Bose stopped putting the double plug adapter in this version, so if you’re flying in an older airplane you might be stock with mono sound.
- Charging cord: The case comes with its charging cable, a standard USB-micro USB cord. So if you have apple devices, you will need to carry it too.

I don’t use google assistant, but it works well with Siri. It just needs different command options.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

We have struggled with the connection to her Microsoft Surface and Windows 10 since we got these headphones at Christmas last year.  Today I spent 7 hours working on this, as I determined I would get them to work on the Surface.  I talked to two folks from Microsoft Support, each for well over an hour, plus waiting for software updates and other stuff it was a legit 7 hours.  I gave over the control to my computer and watched the support folks try to figure this out, but in the end they couldn’t get it to work.  The last thing we tried was updating the Bose software on the headphones, but that didn’t fix it either.  To be fair, the Windows 10 searching through many different screens and settings was not convenient and was very confusing.  At the start of this process, I was not able to connect to an Amazon Echo, which we did get to work.  I was using the connection to a Yamaha Sound bar as the bogie, and that worked from the get go.  At this point I don’t know who is at fault, Microsoft or Bose.  All I know is we were not able to get them to work on the Surface.  As I said, they work great with an iPhone, and also with an iPadPro.  Maybe the Apple developers at Bose can swing over and help the Microsoft developer team???????

I took off the headphones and realized it was my white noise machine on my bedside table. I keep it pretty loud to drown out noises from outside the house. I turned the noise cancellation back on and the sound completely disappeared. How in the world can it do that? I mean, maybe white noise is something particularly easy for them to cancel out, but that is still incredible. Is someone playing a prank on me and just turning the noise machine off as soon as I hit the noise cancellation button?

Unfortunately, noise-cancelling is a bit of a stretch... they do a pretty good job of cancelling out mechanical sounds, like the washer, dryer, and air conditioner; however, they are not as adept at cancelling voices.  I still hear his reality shows. I have decided to keep the headphones, as they do provides pretty good sound and are better than any other earbuds than I've tried. They are comfortable and allow me to increase the volume higher than Bluetooth earbuds. I haven't used the Alexa/Google button much, other than some initial testing. I like the fact that I can switch from one to the other, depending on which virtual assistance I wish to use. The battery seems to have a pretty long life.

Overall, these are a keeper, and a decent purchase, given Amazon's flexible payment policy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:

i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very ""clean"" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as ""calming"". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.

ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don't expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.

iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.

iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.

v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn't play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can't connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.

Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.

vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.

I hope this helps...","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Works with PSVR too!","September 5, 2019","This review focuses on using them for gaming, specifically for the PS4. They work great for everything else too but I wanted to focus on the gaming aspect because I hadn’t seen it covered.

I also purchased as set of PlayStation Gold wireless headphones, unfortunately they suffered from Bluetooth drop outs in wireless mode and didn’t fit well. (Just FYI usb 3.0 in conjunction with external hard drives creates electronic noise in the 2.4ghz spectrum which effects the wireless connectivity, including your router)

Anyway back to the Bose, these fit extremely well and are very comfortable even for people with extra large heads like myself. The wireless does NOT work with the PS4, however I don’t know about you but if I’m playing the PS4 then I’ve got a controller in my hand or a VR headset on...both of which have a 3.5mm jack.
Speaking of PSVR, these fit perfectly over the headset and because the PSVR requires a wired headset the PS Gold’s have zero advantage compared to the Bose.
Sound wise they are awesome and deliver a very immersive experience. Are they 3 times as good as the PS Gold? No. But they are notably richer and more nuanced and the fit is significantly better for me personally.

Note: If you are trying to use these with a mic for gaming you will need to pick up the android wired cable with Mic for the QC25’s.
Also the 2.5mm input on the headphones themselves requires a FIRM push, if you see metal on the plug tip then it’s not full inserted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don't even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8"" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.

After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn't function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn't think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said ""We like to take care of our customers"".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Pros:
• Very good for work - I'm not distracted by colleagues' conversations any more.
• Noice cancellation is perfect - all outside sounds are removed, but if I someone would talk loudly near by, I could hear it quietly. That's perfect for not being distracted by random conversations around, but still be able to hear if someone would want to talk to me.
• Battery life is great
• App is very nice (only just few little complaints)
• Holds on my head very conveniently
• Has automatic sleep mode, so it's convenient if I forget it on my table turned on
• Supports two devices. Works better than expected (no other headphones worked that well for me before)

Cons:
• I can hear some ultrasound
• Strange feeling during 1st days of usage, but I think, I got used to it already.
• App does not remember what noice cancellation level I had set before (wanted to use it in a Low mode during 1st days, but now I got used to High mode).
• I'm not yet used to keep it on my neck - too big for me, restricts my head movements
• Some small issues with switching between two devices. Got confused couple of times which device is being connected to, but overall it supports two devices best as from my experience with other devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The headphones fit the ears nice and snug, and the noise cancelling works wonders--a lot better than those $79.99 on-ear models.

However, the electronics don't seem to work well.  I can't get this to work with my Samsung Galaxy S8 Phone (Android Oreo update).  I've tried pairing several times and downloading new firmware, but it still won't connect.  Worse, the on-off switch appears to not work--it doesn't stay shut off!  It will turn on at random times and the battery gets drained.  The instructions didn't come in a booklet, you have to download the app.  Using it in corded mode seems to confuse the software.

Cnet says they both have a ""9"" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.

Phone performance:
I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.

Sound quality
The Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you're playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn't do very much at all. It does let you ""find your headset"" similar to the ""find my phone"" app, and it will apply firmware. (I'm hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)

Noise cancellation
The Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.

Controls
The Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don't think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.

Comfort
The Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it's less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I'm familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.

Style
The Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.

Conclusion
Even though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

If you do not have honest neighbors, not recommended to have Amazon drop it off on your doorstep. Now, as far
as the headphone goes, it is wireless, plus has the mono cable for wired use, when you turn on the noise cancellation,
it greatly reduces the ambient noise, plus, it is so comfortable, the around the ear feel is natural, you can wear it all

These headphones are amazing!  I might have been perfectly satisfied with the first version of the QC35s, but I luckily stumbled on the second generation which includes the Google Assistant integration.  I initially thought it would be a small bonus, but I totally underestimated how powerful and convenient this could be.  It's more than just a trigger for voice commands.  It's a surprisingly flawless implementation that allows Google Assistant to turn you into much more productive multi-tasker.

GOOGLE ASSISTANT VOICE COMMANDS:
You start by connecting the headphones to your phone via the 'Bose Connect' app.  Now, all you have to do is press and hold the button on the left side and speak your voice command.  This is a lot easier and less tedious than having to precede every command with ""OK Google"", but this isn't even the best part of this integration.

GOOGLE ASSISTANT NOTIFICATIONS:
The best feature of the Google Assistant integration is the ability to receive voice notifications!  Whenever you receive a notification on your phone, it is automatically spoken to you on your headphones.  When text messages are received, not only can you have the message read to you with a single click of the left button, but you're also presented with an immediate opportunity to send a voice-to-text response by holding the left button while speaking.  This allows you to multitask like no other.  The Bose Connect app allows you to choose between temporarily pausing your audio during the notification (so you don't miss a second of that podcast you were listening to) or just reducing its volume while the notification is played.  You can double press the left button to shut Google Assistant up mid-notification if you ever wish to as well.  It's an excellent experience.

I tried smartwatches in the past, but they never seemed to deliver a convenience above and beyond what a phone could do on its own.  The hands-free and vision-free experience these headphones enable fills the void we all hoped smartwatches would.

CONNECTING TO TWO DEVICES:
Speaking of multitasking, these headphones can be connected to two devices at a time without the fumbling and confusion that comes along with other Bluetooth headphones offering similar functionality.  I’ve got mine connected to my Android phone and my Windows PC.  Start playing media from either device and it’s streamed right to your headphones.  To play from the opposite device, just pause the current media on the first device and then play the new media on the second device.  It’s that simple.  But to receive the notifications I mentioned, your current connection must be with your phone.

FIT, FORM, & FUNCTION:
Lastly, you might be wondering how these headphones perform as headphones.  The answer is great!  Check out all the reviews of the first generation for the details as I don’t think much has changed there.  They’re very comfortable, lightweight, and they don’t make your ears sweat or hurt over long periods of continual usage.  I explained the left button for interacting with Google Assistant in depth, but the media controls on the right are just as useful and intuitive.  Double-click the play/pause button to skip to the next track and triple-click it to go back a track.  The wireless range, the sound quality, and the battery life (20 hours) is all top notch for such a portable package.  I haven’t tested the mic quality during a call yet, but even if it’s not the greatest, this headset has already exceeded my expectations in so many ways - I couldn’t be happier with the design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

It blocks most white noise entirely (HVAC, high pitch noise from lighting, etc). It probably cuts voices down by 60%. Bluetooth and dual pairing with my laptop and phone work seamlessly. Unfortunately, the audio quality is lacking - both highs and lows (""must be Bose?"") are disappointing... but with music on at a low volume, these pretty much block out all voices entirely. The headphones themselves are lightweight and feel very sturdy and luxurious with the suede and leather; they certainly don't feel like cheap plastic.

Questionable Bluetooth.","October 31, 2019","Sound and noise cancellation is fantastic. I use my headphones primarily at the office and on planes.

Unfortunately the microphone is terrible unless you’re in a very quiet environment. Ambient noise is picked up and amplified to the point of extreme distraction for whoever is on the other line. I use these for business calls so have to be very careful where I am when I do. Others appear to have this issue but not everyone. It’s frustrating and not acceptable at this price point.

The other major issue is Bluetooth. I regularly have my phone and computer connected. They consistently disconnect and reconnect throughout the day. More rarely, my voice is garbled to people on the other line and I end up have to shut them off and finish the call with another headset. Again, not good at this price point.

Despite the flaws, I still use these everyday. The sound, noise cancellation, and lost calls in quieter environments are very good. But for the cost, the mic and Bluetooth issues really need to be fixed. So I can’t wholeheartedly recommend them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The cheaper headset actually surprised me in terms of sound quality and ear comfort. However you do begin to feel the pressure of the headband after a while which leads to headaches.
I’m on my pc a lot and wanted headphones that wouldn’t hurt my head during long sessions so after comparing the countless Bose and Sony reviews I decided to go with Bose since every review said they were more comfortable.
 I haven’t had it long but I can already tell it’s the best set I’ve had.  The comfort is at a level which I didn’t think was possible for headphones.  Really just enjoyable to have on.
The sound quality is something I also really like.  The reason I like it is that it doesn’t try to over exaggerate everything that’s played through it with bass or effects.
It has a very balanced clear sound when it needs to and it has great sounding bass when the song calls for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

For the price though I thought they would be better. The sound quality is great... the color is really nice. But I don’t understand why they are called noise cancellation. In fact some noises are amplified. For example, on the plane, the noise of the plane engine was slightly reduced while the noise of the kid next to me talking nonstop to her mom was enhanced. I was hoping I could turn on noise cancellation without any music so I could take a nap but to do that I still had to use foam ear plugs as well or I had to use my white noise app which kind of defeats the purpose.
That complaint aside, the sound is really nice for watching movies or zoning out while listening to music. The battery lasts forever. I went on a three week trip and only charged them once before hopping on the plane back home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I can listen to delicate harpsichord music while sitting in a jet airplane, and music is totally enjoyable.

The sound is very good.  Good bass.  Clean highs.  They sound a tad better than my Audio Technica ATH-M50s.  Bear in mind that I'm 72 years old, so I probably can't hear much above 10 or 12 KHz.  It can Bluetooth pair with with multiple device, an you can switch from one to another.  (Very very nice.)  You can have the noise cancellation high (normal), low, or off.  This is good if you are, say, using them at home where the isn't much noise, but need to hear the doorbell or phone.  There is a built-in rechargeable battery.  It last a long time.

There is one button that you press it once to stop/start the music twice for something else, 3 times to go back to the beginning of the track.  This is difficult:  there are too many things to remember, and worse yet, there is no nice little cheat sheet, and no manual; you have to install an app and then read through the FAQ and look for the question like ""How do I advance to the next track"".

There are constant small glitches when playing from a laptop. While it works fine when playing from a smartphone, the limitation is annoying. There is a thread with more than 26 pages in Bose's support community discussing the issue.
Removing from the laptop and reinstalling worked for a while. Now it doesn't. I updated the firmware and followed all recommendations, but the problem persists.
For the very high price it charges you, Bose should provide a better support.
I do not recommend the purchase, with so many other similar options in the market.

Update:
I could make the headphones to work without glitches by disabling a couple of Bluetooth Services, namely ARfcomm, AudioWear, AudioWear Voice and Handsfree Telephony. It still presents glitches, but now it is less frequent.
However, now I have another issue. The earpads began to wear off. It is way too early for this to happen (I bought about 10 months ago).

Of course, I'm apparently underestimating the lung and sound making capacity of my Mom also.

And then I bought the QC35 II.
And what an upgrade!
First the overall sound quality improved, especially when the noise reduction is on (strangely, music sounds better with NR on than without NR).
And then I made a side by side comparison, and wow, what an improvement in the noise reduction field!!
This week end, my neighbourg decided to throw a party with live music.  I started to feel in despair until I remembered I had the QC35, so I put them on, and boom, the noise disappearely nearly completely. I just played some relaxing music to a very low level, and I felt completely in peace.
This thing is magical!
I like that through the Bose application, I could reprogram the asssistant button to select the NR level (3 levels, High, medium, or off).  I guess I am old school, I do not like the assistants like Alexa, Google, and so on. I am not using these things.
I did not have the opportunity to use them for phone calls. But reviews are not so enthusiast about this feature, so I guess I will not use these headphones for calls. I still have ""regular"" wired earbuds with a good quality microphone to run with my Samsung S10 when I am on the move and need to attend some calls.
FInally, as far as design is concerned, clearly the Bose headphones are not the slickest headphones around.  They look pretty dull to me, but well, at least for me, I prefer having the best noice reduction around, with a decent sound quality, rather than the best looking headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I travel to Europe and Asia several times a year and take domestic, cross country flights regularly. I decided to purchase my Bose headphones before my latest trip in Week 37, 2018. I put on my new headphones, settled into my seat, hit play on my travel playlist, and everything else disappeared.  I didn't realize just how good the noise cancelling function worked until I took the headphones off for a minute. The noise of the plane seemed almost deafening.  I quickly put the headphones back on and enjoyed the rest of my 10 hour flight with everything around me silenced.  I've bought several pairs of headphones prior to purchasing the Bose headphones because I wasn't willing to pay the price.  I can tell you that they don't even come close to the noise cancelling abilities of the Bose headphones.  In addition to the noise cancelling feature, the look and feel (especially the feel) of the materials are of the highest quality. The way the headphones feel when I put them on is like nothing I've ever experienced.  Again, all the other headphones I've bought and tried don't even come close.  The sound quality is also exceptional. I would definitely recommend these to someone who wants their own little oasis, especially people who travel a lot. The other headphones I've tried aren't even worth considering. If I could do it all over I would have saved myself the $200 I spent on lower quality headphones and gone straight to the Bose headphones from the beginning. I will use these headphones for a long, long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I originally received the Bose QC 35II  and later Sony 1000XM3 through a vine program to test and review. I tested both headphones and have used many other types of headphones, over the ear and inner ear.

I purchased another Bose QuietComfort QC 35II Wireless Bluetooth Headphone a couple of years later (long story). I am not an Audiophiles by any means but I like Music.! Recently, I read a ""highly rated"" review of the Sony 1000XM3, therefore I felt compelled to write a review of the Bose QuietComfort QC 35II Wireless Bluetooth Headphones.

I LOVE the overall comfort of the Bose QC 35II, literally all day comfort. I have worn these when using an elliptical, watching a movie while connected to a laptop, and listening to all kinds of music. Comfort is where the Sony 1000XM3 fell off for me, as did other over the ear headphones. The Sony headphones do sound good, ANC is subjective!

The build quality on the Bose is excellent, they don't feel cheap! The bass is not overbearing and heavy, however it does sound clean! Listening to the song ""Purple Rain"", I became immersed in the music...I could hear everything as it was meant. That has not happened with any other headphone or IEM. Sony ear-cups do not feel as solid and I don't think overall quality is the same.

I have tried the Sony 1000XM3, Plantronics FIT, Grado Labs SR-80, JBL, Apple OEM inner ear, Klipsch IEM, and a few other generic brands. The Bose QC 35II  remain my favorite for sound! The Plantronics are good for working out. The IEMs, such as Klipsch get full of ear-wax.

I have the headphones connected to the Echo, so I can push the speech button the headphone and ask Alexa to play a song. That is sweet!! There is also a multi-function button for Siri, which Bose does not advertise. Pairing to phone and laptop was a piece of cake, the headphones tell you which device it is connected to. The Bose App is basic but provides information on the headphones, firmware updates, and connection to Echo.

Sound is a personal thing, everyone experiences this differently. Therefore, headphones that work for me, may not work for you. I have used the following types of headphones:

Sony Sports Wired (going back to the 80's)
Panasonic (going back to the 80's)
Grado Labs - SR-80 Wired
Klipsch IEM Wired
Apple OEM wired
Plantronics FIT Bluetooth
Sony 1000XM3 BT
Bose QC2 BT

Sony is a conglomerate, multiple business units making different products. We all know that Sony is a legendary company!I Sony products are hit or miss. I  have been a little obsessed with Bose, not only the products but as a company. The Bose QC 35II are something that the company's founder - Dr. Amar Bose would have been proud of.  Bose as a company is an amazing story and the products that they produce are incredible. I am now thinking about their portable speaker offerings.

The only drawback that I can is the lack of an EQ in the app. However, many other manufacturers do not offer this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I basically live on Delta. Throughout the year I have made some really stupid headphone purchases on a whim, being a complete newbie to the headphone game. Right before purchasing these I had purchased Beats Solo 3, again on a whim, during Amazon prime day.  After wearing them several times, painfully so, I realized that I had wasted $150 on headphones and I had to buckle down and do some research B) these are expensive… &*^%ing expensive.  This was a big decision.

All that said - holy crap these things are amazing!  I can literally wear them, and have worn them, all day with zero discomfort. To put that into perspective, after about 30 minutes - to an hour with my other headphones, my ears would start to hurt due to the pressure and poor product  ergonomics.  Not these - they are amazeballs.

The noise canceling is also by far superior to anything I’ve tried.  I recently took a last-minute flight and got stuck in the middle seat in between two men that were well over 6’2 and chatting each other throughout the flight.  FML.  BUT - I seriously could not hear a word coming from them.  One guy even had to tap my shoulder to get my attention when the flight attendant came around. These things seriously rock.

I still own, and use, my original pair of QC2s (now just for piano practice) as well as my QC15s (@ home office), and QC25s (@ work office).
I originally thought I'd try the QC35 (Series II) Wireless because my Pixel 2 phone is missing the all-important headphone jack (grrrr).

Glad I did!.

The QC35 is lighter, more comfortable, and has better noise cancelling than any of its older siblings. And, when paired with my smart TV, I can hear the faintest whisper of dialogue or really crank up the explosions without waking up the family - even when the Air Conditioner is blowing its hardest!

My QC25s go thru at least 1 AAA battery per week with daily use (6-10hrs per day) so I was very skeptical of the QC35s non-replaceable internal battery, but it really hasn't been a problem thus far. Even after multiple hours of catching up on all things MCU, I have yet to get it below 60% and it charges fairly quickly with a decent wall adapter.

So, why didn't I give it 5 stars???
1.  The new carrying case is way too small and no longer has the expandable outer pocket or shoulder strap that my QC2 case has (been an issue since the QC15s). That could be a plus for some people, but the QC2 case (which I still use!) has enough room for me to carry a couple of airline travel necessities (like a blow up pillow and eye mask).
2.  The included audio cable (for non blue tooth use) and USB charging cord are way too short.
3.  Bose non longer includes an audio extension cable (which would make point 2 irrelevant) or the funky little 2x1 ""airline adapter"" (who cares, right?).  You can still buy these accessories but, for $350 you shouldn't have to.

All that said... I still highly recommend these headphones!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The noise cancelling feature works so well it is disappointing to take them off.  I had not considered how nice it would be to use these to make phone calls until I just made a call.  Not only could I hear the other person on the line, they could also hear me very well.
* You should note that Alexa integration is available after you update the firmware on the headphones, so don't be surprised when, during the setup process, you are only presented with Google Assistant as your voice control choice.
* The headphones came with 60% battery and this lasted me a long time, about a week.
* I like the Bose-supplied case, I don't see what another third-party case would do for me.

The battery life is another huge plus when it comes to travelling. I have gone for 8 hours of flying plus a 2 hour layover while watching movies non stop and the battery only went to 60% after being fully charged. The sound quality is very clear and has some bass, no award winning bass here.

This review is for casual and audiophile users.

Sound:
Very good sound 4/5 stars. Extended tight bass (that can be dialled down via the app at will), good definition, good musicality. Voices and single instruments don't sound ""real"" but music comes out with great enjoyment and overall rhythm and warm pleasant tones. You can listen to music for hours in these. They never sound like ""you're really there at a live venue"" - like better and more expensive headphones do - but 99% of people don't care and won't notice. You buy these headphones because they do everything rather well, and have active noise cancelling. Tip: If you really want the best sounding headphones around this price and you MUST have noise cancelling check-out the Shure 535 in-ear headphones which have far superior sound in every way and better (alas passive) noise-cancelling. Bottom line: these headphones are best value, just before diminishing returns where more money buys you fine improvements, whereas less money buys you significantly worst headphones.

My experience: Music and Hi-Fi fanatic for 20 years. Own multiple DAC's all the way up to $2000 devices, multiple $500+ headphones which I used to compare these headphones against streaming both Spotify as well as lossless Tidal.

Comfort:
These truly are the most comfortable over-ear headphones you can buy. They are light, fit beautifully with materials that feel soft and welcome to your head. Hours of easy listening await you. If comfort and noise cancelling is a priority for you look no further.

Noise Cancelling:
Myth buster first: You don't need active noise-cancelling. Passive in-ear headphones have better passive noise cancelling. The reason why you buy active noise-cancelling is either because you prefer to have on-ear rather than in-ear headphones, OR because you like to turn the noise-cancelling off some times. If you don't mind smaller and more travel-friendly in-ear headphones and don't mind having passive noise-cancelling on at all times. Do try a pair of Shure 535's before committing to on-ear headphones. All that said, Noise-cancelling on the bose is Very good 8/10.

Other:
Battery, connectivity, features, functionality are all top notch. You will not find better.

Overall I give these 5/5 stars not because they are the best headphones in the world - they are not. But they are the best on-ear noise-cancelling headphones in the world, and if you don't care for ""astoundingly clear audiophile grade sound"" - these are best value for the price.

Should you buy them? Yes. You will not regret it. You either know what professional and audiophile headphones and DACs sound like, in which case you wouldn't be looking at these headphones OR you don't know that you need better headphones yet, so these are the best headphones you can currently appreciate, and a great way to step into the world of great sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I had resisted due to the lackluster physical appeal of Bose compared to other brands, but I can't express how much better the sound quality, comfort and noise cancellation were with Bose. These headphones are outstanding!

I actually couldn't believe how much more comfortable the earpads were than any other pair of headphones I've tried at this price point (e.g. Sennheiser HD1). Wearing the Bose for 2+ hours left me forgetting I was even wearing them and I completely tuned out my surroundings.

Accessorywise, the travel case is a good size for travel with interior pockets for cables - I was hoping an AC USB adapter would be included but I ended up using a spare one.

The physical UI on the exterior of the headphones makes pairing and powering on/off incredibly intuitive with a slider button and the voice instructions always let you know the battery life and to which device it's paired.

All in all, Bose really exceeded my expectations and lives up to all the hype.

It says it is built in... I thought that would mean that when I turn it on it would have Alexa on the headphones automatically. Alexa is not on the headphones.
  What I had to do...Download the Bose Connect App. on my phone. Then, Install the apps firmware. Sync my headphones to it. Then download the Alexa app onto my phone. Update it. Then sync my address book to Alexa app so I can make calls. It seems I need to have my phone with me and on every time I want to use Alexa....so it's not built in....You must download 2 separate apps on your phone in order to get this feature.
FYI- My first shipment of headphones I opened the Bose Connect App and all that appeared was the Google Assistant. So I called Amazon tech support who wanted to say it was defective. Well the second shipment arrived last night and so when I opened it up to find all the same issues I was greatly disappointed.
I also called Bose who gave me instructions that weren't quite right either. I believe, this issue is Amazon not Bose. There are no instructions on how to do all of this...we found a website- digitaltrends.com that gave a more complete set of instructions.
I want to be clear. My issue with the headphones is the Alexa feature. The noise cancellation is superb. I've used it today to listen to music and books- it is a wonderful listening experience. My 3 stars are more for the sound quality & lack of sound quality. And if Alexa was ""built in"" I'd give it 4 or maybe 5 stars.
  So Amazon you did not live up to my expectations for this purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

At home, I've had to learn to leave one earcup off the ear - otherwise a family member can walk into the room behind me and prepare an entire meal without my even noticing. That's how well the noise reduction works in a quiet-ish environment.

I used an upcoming plane trip as the excuse to buy this, though I really wanted it for my daily commute on the subway.  It did the job nicely on the plane - the noise of the engines was reduced to a fairly dull roar, and I was able to enjoy my audiobook.

It makes a HUGE difference on the subway - before, I couldn't listen to a book or music without having to crank the volume of my earbuds to dangerous levels, and even then I missed words in almost every sentence. The noise reduction is sufficient that I can hear my audiobooks quite well without deafening myself.  I've played with the noise reduction levels to see how much it cuts out and it is substantial. I never want to commute again without these.

Why is it only 4 stars then? Well, I had hopes of using it with my Windows 7 computer, but it refused to pair. Googling it suggests this is a nearly-universal problem. I never did succeed in getting the two to talk. I now have a Windows 10 machine and it  is working much better. I did have one day where I had to reset the headset to get it to talk to both the laptop and my phone - not sure what the issue was, but basically it kept behaving as if I'd powered it off and on, then connecting VERY briefly to the phone.... then a minute later, repeating the cycle. The total reset seemed to solve that.

The sound quality seems fine. I don't listen to much music, and the times I do, I haven't noticed any issues with, say, the bass quality, so I didn't rate it for that  The battery life seems decent. It's heaver than an old-style headset, of course, but it's quite comfortable to wear for hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The quality is magnificent and when paired with 1 device, seems to work well without any problems. The multi-pairing is still a huge issue and should never be advertised by Bose as a premium feature. I use these routinely for travel and for listening to music, but simply cannot recommend them for professional use.

I loved my Bose QC2's from way back when, and was really excited to order this pair since I have been saving up to go wireless for some time down.

I am disappointed. Not in the sound quality or noise cancellation at all, as of course Bose is the top of the line.

It is the bluetooth software. These things cannot stay connected to my devices (2016 13"" Macbook Pro and iPhone X). I bought these to use in a business setting as I work from home and have video conferences with my colleagues everyday. I have had nothing but issues so far. I want SO desperately to like these, as when they are paired to a single device and not being used for phone calls, they are magnificent. But that is not the function as advertised, and its not what I expect from the top of the line headphones that cost $350.

I have been in meetings with clients where my audio completely stops working and I need to exit the Google Meet window and completely restart Chrome. Not to mention, when connected to two devices, if one of the other devices makes a sound of any type (notification sounds, music playing) the audio lags and drops out, then comes back sped up and then drops out again, rinse repeat. There are even times when I have my phone in my hand, and the headphones will just randomly unpair with them. At this point, I have owned them for 2 weeks and I am bitterly disappointed.

If I got a lemon pair, I'd love to hear from Bose to explain the situation, but from what I can see from forums online, this is not an isolated incident. If I cannot figure out how to make these work more consistently, I will be returning them and looking for an alternate brand. For shame, Bose.

Bose needs to do something to reduce the bulk on their headphones. The headphone case is nice, but the old style was better -- this new version requires the ear pieces to be folded so they rub each other on the exterior plastic part (in no time I am sure these will have rub/scratch marks from storing them in their case).

Not wind-tight.","October 21, 2018","I intentionally ordered these, even though they were pricey, so that I would have Alexa built in. I have come to find out Amazon sent me an old version without Alexa preloaded and without the Alexa logo. I'm a big Alexa user so this was important to me. I selected these after watching the commercial for them lauding the Alexa connectivity and intentionally held off buying these until I was sure they were being issued with Alexa from Amazon.

I've struggled with Amazon for over a week with chat and emails trying to get them returned and new version issued without success. Very frustrating and disappointing.  When I tried to get the newer version from Amazon they said it wasn't possible and that I would just receive the exact same item. I'm not sure why I got a stuck with the older version and others got a new box for the same amount of money. Disappointed for sure.

I can tell from the answers of other users that they received the newer version because they talk about Alexa being pre-loaded and pressing the button being all it takes to get Alexa to work. For me it was much, much more difficult, frustrating and disappointing. It's been a pain in the backside trying to get them setup because there are no instructions in the box addressing the fact that these are the older version without Alexa pre-loaded. I finally found an article on Engadget that at least got me started in the right direction. It took me multiple attempts to get the firmware update applied because, 1. without instructions I didn't know to load the firmware update; and 2. they kept disconnecting from the source .... Ugh. After 3-4 attempts I finally got it loaded. But the frustrating experience tainted my satisfaction with this purchase.

Also, I wore them on a walk on a slightly windy day. I had to cover the headset with a hood to keep the wind noise from entering the ear covers and disrupting what I was listening to.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

This thing AMAZING!! For years I have been resisting the urge to buy noise cancelling headphones because I thought they were just a fad. The latest gizmo. Also, Bose was pretty much the only game in town, and the price was outrageously high.
  Because my wife and I do our fair share of traveling, I felt it was about time to seriously reconsider my thoughts about anc headphones. After watching countless YouTube videos and reading a few reviews online about the different models of anc headphones available today, I decided to take a chance and go with the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II.
  I bought 2 pairs. One black (mine), and one silver (wife's). I was instantly impressed with the sound quality and the effectiveness of the noise cancelling feature. Sounds are full and balanced; nothing really overwhelming (no over the top bass). And oh so comfortable. Just make sure you adjust the headband to fit your head properly. I've worn them for 8-10 hours continually for the past few days, and they never hurt my head or ears. My wife loves her Bose headphones too, and she's very picky about everything I give her. I can vacuum the house, use power tools, make as much noise as I want, and she's no longer bothered.
  The pressure other reviewers feel in their ears are true for me as well. But I just yawn or do any of the usual things a person does to relieve that airline cabin pressure in the ears. Eventually my ears become acclimated and I don't feel the pressure anymore. I set the smart button on the left ear cup to control the noise cancellation level because I can call up my Google Assistant by holding down the play/pause button on the right ear cup. So I don't need two buttons for that feature.
  All in all, we love our new anc headphones. We use them almost everyday to listen to music, watch TV, or just to block out any annoying ambient noises. We have an upcoming trip in a couple of weeks and I can hardly wait to try them on the flight. Glad I finally got these.
  Almost forgot to mention this. The shipping was super fast. Ordered it on a Tuesday, and it arrived on my doorstep the very next day. That's another reason for me to love these things. Thanks Amazon!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I honestly think it has damaged my hearing and I simply cannot use these headphones any longer. I have researched the issue thoroughly on Bose forums and the company provides no work arounds or desire to improve the issue. Some users have worked around the issue by manually turning off the notification sounds on each app so that they don't get their eardrums blown out. However, as these are $350.00 headphones, Bose should fix this issue via firmware, not by expecting their own customer's to provide other customer's with workarounds.

I always thought Bose was the cream of the crop when it comes to Headphones, but from here on out I will just by the Tao Tronics Chinese Knockoffs just because Bose is such a shitty company when it comes to supporting their customers who pay way too much for their products.

Although, since it is considered the best of all, I expected more. I set the noice canceling to high and I can still hear the music around. But I have to say, music is very loud (in the gym).
Another thing I notice is that when I am not playing music but noice canceling is on, i feel some discomfort in my ears, as if there was extra pressure. But noice is cancel effectively (almost)

The material used for this headphone is really great. Just all of it.

What I am not happy with is that it does not fit very well. I had another pair of headphones before (cheap ones) and they wont move during gym activities. But these move. I have to re-position them all the time.

Some thing else particularly annoying is that when i am walking or running I can hear my foot hitting the ground (very loud).

Well I finally bit the bullet and gave them a try and I have to say, Bose got it right.  Yes, not a lot of passive noise canceling but the electronic canceling is wonderful.  Even wearing a ball cap and sun glasses they cut out all of the offensive noises I expose them to.  I even tried them on my Cub Cadet Tank which is a noisy beast.  I normally use the best (passive) Peltor headsets and the Bose are better yet.
One word of caution, they are so good that you could easily forget that a piece of equipment is operating which could lead to injury.

They pair up with my phone and MP3 player immediately which is another good thing.  Sound quality is very good.

Both have keep disconnecting Bluetooth after 2 weeks' use","September 26, 2018","For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say ""Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.""  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.

Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there's no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you'll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.

I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.

Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don't think that's the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I work from home and I am on 4 hours of conference calls a day and dont want to be tethered to phone or pc for that long so I need a comfortable, reliable and long lasting blue tooth headset for work and play. So I purchased the Black QC35 II set first to replace my Samsung Level headphones that just snapped with normal use.  Within the first week I noticed the BT connection dropping intermittently for 3-4 seconds at a time, didnt matter if the phone was in my hand or several feet away sitting on my desk. So I went thru the normal troubleshooting steps of reinstalling and updating software and no luck. I went to Bose website and checked their support forum and found that's its a known issue with no apparent fix that i have found. A customer mentioned he purchased both the black and silver set for himself and his wife and the Silver ones worked fine with no issues.  So I wasted no time and sent back the black set for a refund and purchased the silver Q35 II.  I have found that to be accurate, no issues with the Silver headphones. Now that thats out of the way.  Easy pairing with my Galaxy S8 using the Bose app.  The battery life was significantly longer with Silver Heaphones than the Black Headphones which makes no sense since the were both new. For music, the sound is fantastic, my music tastes ranges from techno Daft Punk to Metalica and everything in between except country. The reliable Blue tooth distance at least my house is acceptable but thats not a big requirement for me.

I am happy that I tried both because there are some big differences. The touch pad on the Sony was really nice for skipping a song on a playlist. The cups over the ear on the Sony are SMALL and the band puts a pretty tight pinch on your head. After using them for an hour it was uncomfortable. I couldn't see using these all day. The sound was excellent, bright and scintillating. For certain types of music this might be preferable. The base was not impressive. If you crank it  up, the base falls apart.
The QuietComfort 35 (Series II) as soon and I put on... I knew the Sony had go back. The larger cup on the Bose don't cramp your ear and the pads were like putting a soft pillow on your head.. so comfortable. You could wear this ALL DAY or on a long flight... in blissful comfort.

When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it's important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.

For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer's fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I'm using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.

In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.

So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I've tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they're even on.

What's also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.

The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don't own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can't really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that ""cabin-like pressure"" and it doesn't bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it's important to test whether or not this might apply to you.

Pros:
Incredibly lightweight and comfortable
Completely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your ears
ANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises
20-hour battery life

Cons:
""Cabin-like pressure"" that may cause headaches for some users
Sound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)

TLDR:
If comfort is your top priority and you're not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I've used them on several flights already and am kicking myself for not having bought them long ago.

Noise Cancellation:
They do an excellent job of cancelling the most of drone of the engine noise and most loud conversations/babies.  Operative word is ""most"".

Comfort
Very light and comfortable.  I wear glasses and find that the temple of the glasses is uncomfortable with the headset on, so I simply remove my glasses when wearing the headphones.

Build Quality
I don't get the sense these are rugged by any means.  That said, it's a trade off between the weight.  Personally, I would have preferred an extra ounce or two and more solid feel.  That said,  if you take good care of your toys, I don't see any issue.  The hard case that they came in protects them well when not wearing them.

Battery life seems fine.  I don't foresee any concerns on long-haul flights.  I keep the charging cable and plug in my case with them.

Headphone Jack
They come with a cable so they can be plugged into typical airline jacks for entertainment.  They do work on the proprietary airline two prong jacks (typically in premium economy or business) by plugging them in the single larger jack.

Bluetooth Pairing
Work great with my iPhones and laptop.

They last for almost 2 weeks on a single charge and I use them at least 4-6 hours each day. I know they have a mic and could use them for conf calls, but I’ve never tried them as I worry that the mic would pic up all the background noise since it isn’t a direct mic in front of my mouth.

Howard","I bought these solely for noise cancellation","November 21, 2018","I bought these Bose headphones solely for the purpose of noise cancellation.  I work at a desk in a room that has a very large overhead fan that goes on and off all day.  The noise is so bad that I found myself getting stressed and literally putting my hands over my ears.  The headphones are absolutely awesome at canceling out that noise.  I wear them virtually all day at work, and I can barely tell when the fan is on versus when it's off.  They are very comfortable, and my ears don't get hot as some other people mentioned.  The part that goes over my ears is actually big enough that my earlobes don't get crushed, which was a problem with the last headphones I tried.  I also have a big head, and these aren't too tight.  Overall extremely comfortable.  My only complaint is that they require being connected to a cell phone in order to work.  So if I forget to bring my cell phone to work -- no headphones.  If my cell phones dies -- no headphones.  I can't understand whey they couldn't make these so that the noise cancellation would work regardless of whether I had my cell phone with me.  In fact you should be able to use the wire to connect them to the computer and listen to something there without a cell phone as well.  The only feature that should require a phone is talking on the phone.  It doesn't make sense that they are useless without one.

Bought the QC35 II December 2017 and have loved them - I've had some minor issues with glitchy sound every now and then but would usually be fixed by repairing. However, yesterday, turned on the headphones as normal - connected to my Macbook Pro - no sound. I thought - hmm thats weird - followed the troubleshooting guide, reset the headphones, repaired the bluetooth etc. Still no dice. I went through this process 3 times, tried another device and eventually gave up - I plugged them in to my computer. Worked fine though the cable was a touch sensitive. This morning - won't even produce sound with the cable connected. For a $350 product Bose is marketing a scam - and when you go to try and get support they have the audacity to try and sell you a 'discounted' new pair for $250. Shameful marketing practices and poor customer service. Very disappointed.

I've had other 'cheaper' ANC headphones, and while the ANC worked OK, I kept hearing how Bose ANC was the best of the best.  So I upgraded.  Or so I thought.  To be fair, the ANC is superior to my Cowin or Nakamichi headphones.

I installed the Bose app right away, as instructed by the Docs that came with the Bose QC 35 II headphones.  That was a mistake, apparently.  The app immediately installs version 4.5.2 firmware without user consent.  There are many complaints about this firmware on the Bose community forums, and elsewhere (Reddit) and Bose claims they cannot find any issues with the firmware (since June '19).  Most of the posts complain of ANC problems created by the update.  Since my headphones were updated right at the get go, I couldn't compare before and after effects.

I had 3 (+1) issues with the headphone (I don't know whether they were caused by the update or not):
1. There was a very annoying 'distorted clipping' when listening to certain meditation music.  I didn't do an exhaustive study of whether the noise was added to other music.  But it was very apparent, and easily discernible by my old ears, and did not exist in other headphones (I went back and forth). I'm not the only one complainting about this issue...
2. The sound was tinny compared to my Cowin E7 Pro headphones.  The Cowin's produce a much richer sound, especially at the low end.
3. The Bluetooth call operation didn't work well.  If I dialed a number while connected, the call didn't automatically attach to the headphones.  I'd have to mess with poking the speaker icon and the BT icon on the phone dialer to eventually get it to connect (Samsung Note 9).  Same with receiving calls.  My other BT headsets just work.  Every time.
4.  Build quality seemed cheap.  Though I don't know how well they would hold up over the long haul.

I will say that they were a bit smaller and lighter than my Cowin, which could be good as long as they hold up.  The control placement and operation were the best of any BT headphone I've owned.

So why pay $300 for headphones that added distortion, tinny sound, and problematic BT integration?  I didn't.  I sent them back and will continue searching for a company that gets the ANC right, along with the other important bits.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've had nothing but positive experiences with Bose products over the past ten years or so. Unfortunately although the QC35 II has great noise canceling and cool features, the one thing it needed to do, which is play uninterrupted music, it failed at. Could not get through one song without 2-3 split second ""cutouts"". I reset the device, firmware was up-to-date, reconnected the device and found again that music playback was cutting out for a split second again. Tried a colleague's pair of QC32 II wireless headphones with my iPhone and did not experience the same issue.

Sounds like Bose has a batch of lemons. Might want to do more research than I did to see if Bose has resolved the issue. Returned the item same day I got it.

While it might be a bit awkward putting these on if you've never used a pair of noise-cancelling cans before (it feels a little like your ears have to pop), you quickly get used to it. The sound quality is phenomenal; I use these mostly for playing video games in addition to music, and they're simply unmatched by any other set of headphones I have, including my pair of Audio Technica studio monitors, and a pair of Sennheiser ""beater"" phones that I use while traveling and such. Though this is to be expected considering the price of the Bose is far more than those other pairs. The bass rings low, highs are crisp, and midrange is full. Zero complaints, but I'm no audiophile, so if you're looking for an in-depth review you'll have to look elsewhere.

Being a gamer, I spend quite a few hours-long sessions with these on. My Audio Technicas had a nasty habit of really hurting my left ear, leaving soreness and a red mark if I tried to use them for more than just a couple of hours at a time. The Bose comfort, by comparison, is astronomically better. I've used these for a number of 8-9 hour sessions (don't judge me, I pay my taxes) and I've NEVER felt any discomfort -- Not once. They are supremely crafted for comfort.

I do have a few complaints, though. The added cost to ship this product with Google Assistant/Alexa functionality is completely lost on me because I don't use either service. In addition to this, having the headphones remain unusable while charging from the USB cable really hurts utility for me. They're usable with the power on and the auxiliary cable attached to your phone or PC and drawing power from there, but the battery still slowly drains in this mode. Having an nondetachable battery cell built into the body of the phones bodes unwell for future-proofing; this is basically the same shady built-in obsolescence that cell phone manufacturers are using to force people to upgrade sooner, and it stinks. At the moment, the battery lasts for quite a while (I can go for nearly 2 full days before requiring recharge), but if this battery loses its robustness over the next couple of years, then I'll never buy another because it's just not worth it at a $300-350 price range for the headphones to die every couple of years due to a battery that isn't built with the same longevity as the headphones themselves are. My cabled Audio Technicas come close to this sound quality, cost $200 cheaper, and have been kicking for 10 years. So if the Bose doesn't give me as long of a lifespan I'll happily go back to a set of cabled cans, sore left ear and all.

Jan 16 2019 Edit: In the previous few months of use I've experienced significant Bluetooth connectivity issues that have caused me to knock a star off my prior rating. I haven't been all that happy with the Bose Connect software which, while a stylish app to look at, feels like it sacrifices easy functionality in order to appear more stylish.

The headphones regularly have issues connecting to my work laptop, which is only a couple of years old, and also to my brand new phone, to which they regularly lose connection for no apparent reason (pictured). Another problem is that sometimes, in the middle of use, they will revert to an odd mode in which I can hear myself, as if I were recording from the microphone, with all other sound distorted. The only fix for this is a complete restart, after which they will no longer receive sound from my laptop without my restarting Windows. Since the headphones lack USB connectivity, and aux cable connection has noticeably poorer sound quality than Bluetooth connection does, this has become a significant issue, as you can imagine.

I can't help but feeling Bose pushed Bluetooth first and foremost, to the neglect of everything else. Maintaining the same sound quality of USB connection, or aux connection, should have been trivial, however the headphones lack it. And I warrant that a severe enough issue to knock a star off my initial rating.

At the risk of sounding like an old man yelling at a cloud: If you're going to force me to use Bluetooth connectivity to get the best sound quality, you better make Bluetooth damned reliable (and it hasn't been). Otherwise just give me a wired connection any day of the week. Bluetooth wireless is just a nice utility; I want good sound quality and comfort first and foremost. If you're similar to me in this aspect, then maybe these headphones are not for you.

Feb 6 2019 Edit: After several weeks of experiencing severe headaches, I finally narrowed it down to Bose's Active Noise Cancellation as the cause after some extensive googling and realizing that many others experience the same headaches as I do when using the ANC included in these headphones. I have no idea why it gives me such a terrible headache, but I was getting it almost every day until I began turning off noise cancellation each time I used the headphones. Normally I wouldn't hold such a subjective complaint against the product, but a significant problem is that these headphones don't save your setting when you turn them off. This means that each and every single time I turn on the headphones to use them, I have to log in to the app, wait for it to load and connect, then navigate the menu to turn off Active Noise Cancellation. This may not seem like a major issue, but trust me, when you're doing it several times every day, it becomes an annoyance extremely quickly. It's something that should be so simple to fix, too.

In addition to this, whenever you use the headphones with the cable, all of the buttons become non-functional. Since the headphones start up with noise cancellation active every single time and the buttons don't respond in cabled mode, you can never turn off noise cancellation. This basically means that I will never be able to use cabled mode without getting a severe headache. Thanks, Bose.

I have added photos, too, so you can see these headphones have held up very well with daily use. Build quality is indeed impressive.

3-Months Conclusion: These are still great headphones with supreme build and sound quality, but there are significant issues involved that I would not have expected when paying $350 for a pair of headphones. I would expect a higher level of polish when spending so much money. Buying these did in fact turn out to be a mistake, despite their positive aspects, and I do regret my purchase after a few months of use.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After having these headphones for an entire year I'm just feel like I was completely ripped off.
The headphones have great audio quality and all the fantastic features that is mentioned above. However, these headphones have serious issues when it comes to the audio skipping when using the bluetooth wireless mode. It's not a fluke issue with my headphones, this is a consistent issue with these headphones. If you google ""Bose QC35 skipping"" you will see a multitude of message boards of people spanning for the past 4 years with these same issues. There is a rabbit hole of forums dedicated to shoddy bluetooth quality of these headphones. I was unaware of this before purchasing these headphones. These headphones are VERY expensive and for the price they should at the very least play CONSISTENT AUDIO! They worked fine for a 8 months. Then a I noticed many major audio issues. Sometimes the audio wouldn't sync with the video I was watching on youtube, phone call would have in and out connection, music would begin to skip. I was so busy at the time unfortunately I did not have time to remedy the issue. Now there is nothing I can do about it as my warranty is up. I really wanted to like these headphones. Please take this a warning, if you buy these headphones they may work great for the first 6 months- 1 year, maybe slightly longer. However, they take a huge turn for the worst after the warranty is up. If I had the money I would buy the Sony WH1000XM3. Many customers on the Bose message board got fed up with the customer service representatives giving them the run-around and bought the WH1000XM3, and came back months and years later saying how they still work just as great as the day they bought them. I just wish I would have known that prior to purchasing these headphones.

Very good connectivity and keep multiple connections with different devices. The app allows you to do change the sensitivity of the noise cancelling as well. Perfect pair of headphones for any type of travel. My only gripe about these are that the cushions, although very comfortable do wear quite quickly. You can purchase a replacement set for $30 which can be user installed. Overall, I would highly recommend this product.

Update: After exactly 1 yr 2 months and 1 week, this happened to the cushions. Be conscious that if you are buying this for heavy use, multiple hours a day everyday, be aware its cushions tend to tear up.

They are relatively comfortable, and the sound quality is very clear.

That said, my main issue is with the port for the audio cable. It is EXTREMELY particular, and I have to wiggle it around to actually get it to get both ears to work. This is rather disappointing for a brand new pair of $350 headphones. My PC does not have Bluetooth, so I am sort of stuck using the cable. My ultimate concern is that the jack will wear out fast.

It comes down to these or the Sony WH-1000xM3 (watch videos to compare the two)

Here is my analysis

Bose QC 35 II:

Pro's:

Good Sound quality
Good Noise canceling
Good aesthetical appeal
Decent Battery life
Comfortable****
Multi Point Bluetooth Pairing**

Cons:

-Sound Quality while amazing doesn't beat Sony's WH x1000M3
-Noise Cancellation is much better in Sony - first time ever but Sony did it
-Aesthetics better on Sony
-Battery life better on Sony
-Newer Bluetooth on Sony
-USB C Rapid charging technology for Sony
-Sony also gives you a much better carrying case with pockets for all the wires (this is a small thing but when you're paying close to $300 small things matter too)

With this review some may say why not buy the Sony's but the Sony's have their own set of issues: 1) You can not multi point connect with bluetooth. This is not the same thing as pairing. The Sony's can be paired with 8 devices and it will remember them so you do not have to configure it every time. However, if you're using your headphones with your laptop and you have a phone call coming in, you can't simply answer the phone call and expect to hear them and talk to them on your headphones. You will have to disconnect the bluetooth from the laptop and then activate the bluetooth on the phone - this may sound like a trivial thing but when you're working and you use your headphones all day this gets a bit annoying. 2) The Sony's get uncomfortable around your ears after a couple of hours and your ears feel sweaty and that doesn't happen with the Bose. 3) The Sony's have a touchpad on the right ear cup instead of buttons but when it's cold outside, the condensation creates a ""phantom touch"" therefore skipping your songs at time - so if you use your headphones outside and it gets cold in your area this is something to consider. 4) The voice quality via microphone (if you do a lot of phone calls) isn't the best for the Sony's.

Both are great but you need to evaluate your needs and wants and see what works for you - the price is similar for both. The Sony WH x1000M4 were supposed to come out at IFA this year in September but they did not and the new Bose Headphones do not really live up to their $400 cost or its predecessor the Bose QC 35 II.

you will love them.  it works flawlessly

I searched the internet and have seen various prices My only disappointment with the 35ii is that the audio jack is not the standard 3.5 mm (1/8 inch) style that we have known and loved for about 50 years. Instead, the phones have a 2.5 mm jack. I did not see this noted in any of the many reviews that I read---they all mention a standard audio connection. The phones come with a cable that plugs into the 2.5 mm jack and provides a standard 3.5 mm plug on the other end. But for the life of me I cannot even guess why a 3.5 mm wasn't used on the phones themselves so that any standard cable could be used. So if wired connection is important to you be advised that you may wantto buy an additional (more robust and longer) adapter cable, and I do see some on Amazon. Apparently the smaller jack is used on other headphones as well. But why? Makes no sense to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have had many pairs of headphones and ear buds from Bose and these are simply not up to par. The best way I can describe it is they sound “hollow.”  The sound is what I would expect from a pair I pick up from the drug store for $19.99, in a pinch.

The reviews from practically every trusted site said they are very close to the Sony competitors for sound quality whilst being more comfortable. I can’t say for sure because I haven’t heard the Sony WH1000m3 cans but I hope they sound far better than these or else wireless cans are still just garbage. I find that the Bose SoundSport earbuds have far superior sound to these at a much lower price.

Comfort was excellent and noise canceling was very good. Bluetooth worked flawlessly as well. However, I cannot countenance paying $350 for headphones, the sound from which makes me frown.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I fly once a month, so it’s sooo nice to have that freedom when walking through the airport.  I really enjoy the fact that these headphones are rechargeable, I didn’t have a problem with the battery on my previous, but seeing that I can just plug in at the end of the night makes it very convenient.  The sound quality is obviously phenomenal, that’s why we pay the $$ for Bose products.  Noise cancellation I’d say is not as great as my previous corded ones, but still better than anything else i’ve tried.  When I found out there was an app, I was like WTF? But the app is pretty useful.  Being able to connect to two devices at once is really cool. I can connect to my phone and my computer while I work so I don’t miss any notifications.

Cons:
With all that good, there are a few things that would make these headphones perfect.  1. It would be nice to have play/pause, skip, and restart capabilities directly on the headphone.  2. When I take a call, I lose the noise cancellation capability and I can hear what’s going on in the background which gets a little distracting.  Even with this said, I’d highly recommend these for anyone looking.

REALLY, BOSE???","March 6, 2019","The Bose QC35 II is by far the best pair of headphones I’ve owned...and I have used quite a few...

I haven’t owned this long enough to give feedback on battery and interaction w/my Echo Show (Alexa) but I’m hoping those will be good experience.

I’m here mostly for those who are considering investing in these great headphones for the purpose of singing in Smule (the Sing app).

First of all, I think it’s pretty ridiculous that Bose would include an audio cable/wire without including a MIC audio wire!  But since it’s not a big deal and no big investment, this is resolved by purchasing a 3.5mm wire w/mic, right? WRONG!
To make matters a bit more frustrating for consumers such as myself, not only Bose made the female input jack in these headphones smaller than 3.5mm but they also make no mention of it in the owner’s manual.  To say such thing is super lame on Bose’s part is gross understatement!

So...if you are indeed thinking of buying these to use with Smule app, you’ll need to invest in good audio wire with microphone (I invested in Beats mic wire...can be found at Walmart for $20) and had to purchase a 3.5mm female converter with a 2.5mm male plug in order to connect the Beats mic wire to my new QC35 II.  Now, what was BOSE thinking?  After all, they know about Smule and how the worldwide popular singing app has and is creating plenty market for the audio equipment industry...and Bose didn’t impress me when it comes to making it rather inconvenient to use these Bluetooth headphones work w/wired mics.

And no, I haven’t found any headphones with wired mics that supersede the sound quality that my Bose QC35 II headphones render.  So it’s something for Bose to improve...and their marketing folks ought to know better than omit important info from consumers.  While Bluetooth option is an awesome thing, there remains certain online activities that require wired mics...Smule being one...and trust me, I’ve tried using “state of the art” expensive audio equipment to sing in Smule and even the most advanced of audio equipments (such hand held microphones; stand mics (Yeti), mic filters, digital headphones, etc, etc) render poor audio result compared to using wired mics with a good set of headphones.  As far as Smule sing app goes, even cheap earbuds do far better (because it has wired mics!) than expensive audio equipment without wired mic!

So either Bose “forgot” that some of us need wired mics w/a 3.5mm male plug, and by the way, that’s SUPER USEFUL for when battery time is shorter than the consumer intends to use these headphones for, or Bose purposely made these nice headphones w/a 2.5mm female input to make us go out and spend more money just to plug into their nice Bluetooth headphones??

Whatever the reason, I expected a LOT BETTER from BOSE, especially while paying almost $400 (that price includes extra service protection warranty) for A PAIR OF HEADPHONES that don’t even come with a wired mic and HAVE NO input to connect a 3.5mm audio cable to the headphones! I feel that there’s always some type of sound quality loss when we have to use adaptor connectors so I truly don’t understand why Bose chose to make the QC35 II with a 2.5mm female input in the headset while providing a cable that has no mic in it!  Yes, some use these just to listen to music, videos, news, etc.  But what if I’m listening to something in my device while wearing these and using the audio wire and my mother or a friend calls me via FaceTime or Facebook messenger or whatever else?  I can easily accept the video call but must unplug the headphones, which usually causes an audio problem in the video conference app, because it doesn’t transfer audio, once the audio device first used is disconnected. Something Bose seems to have completely disregarded.  Obviously, the focus in these is the Bluetooth capabilities.  But I ask Bose this question: why would I buy a wired pair of Bose headphones that cost not a lot less than these while getting less quality sound?  So if these work with audio cable, which it does, why not include an audio cable with a mic???  Charge the extra $20 or so dollars for goodness sake but it’s pretty sad to make such great quality headphones without sending it with a wired mic while knowing that the microphones in our devices don’t handle all recordings and are not designed to work well with singing apps!  Headphones aren’t just for listening!  What do professional singers wear when recording their songs inside a studio?? HEADPHONES!  Is it important for them to hear their own voices through the headphones they wear? You bet!  This is why those headphones are well connected with whatever microphones professional singers and studios use.  The same is true for ordinary, amateur singers such as myself.  But unlike pro singers, all we ordinary singers need is a wired mic that connects directly to the fancy expensive Bose headphones we invest on!

It’s a BOSE so yes, they are awesome headphones.  But needless to say I’m rather disappointed.  I can’t use these until the extra pieces arrive and worse than that, I had to find out the hard way!  Nothing in the specs here or even in the Bose website or in the owner’s manual shows that these headphones have a 2.5mm female input to the audio cable.  I feel a wired mic w/the appropriate size plug should be something to expect in a pair of headphones that cost $350!!!! Most of all, I feel that any type of electronic should come with pictures of it indicating the physical parts inside and outside of it.

Bose mentions that they include the 3.5mm audio cable.  Unfortunately, they make NO mention that the end of the audio cable which plugs into the headphones is actually size 2.5mm!

REALLY, BOSE??  A $20 mic wire with the correct size male plug to fit into the headset unconventional female input size would’ve saved a lot of frustration here...not to count given you a perfect “5 stars” score...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

By the time the Sony head phones arrive I had used the Bose a few times but didn't use them heavily just in case I needed to return them.  So after reading reviews  about the Bose and Sony and Beats I decided to purchase the Sony head phones.  As I said by the time the Sony head phones arrive I was coming close to the 30 day return policy  for returning the Bose.  But I wanted to compare the two for myself.  Here are my findings.  The Bose by reputation know how produce a device the reproduces clear natural sound.  Sony, for the longest time has been making.... no, inventing products for us that in some cases are second to none.  So after using them for a week I have to say for myself the Sony Head phones came in #1.  Like the Bose I heard the clear sound,  but with the Sony's  I got a bit more bass.  I'm not concerned yet with all the buttons, whistles, and bells that the two give.  Rather the best sound possible using some not so good compressed music sources (Mp3).  I can only imagine up grading to uncompressed  recorded music will sound using the Sony's.
My only problem is I'm stuck with both units because due to a stay in the hospital I went over the 30 day return limit to sent back the BOSE Head phones.  PS. Look for review on the Sony head phones","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The major, and really only, complaint I have about them is that the ear cushions deteriorate after a while. It does take a bit... for me it was about a week ago from when I bought them... which was probably around a year ago. You can buy replacement cushions which are not nearly as expensive as the headphones in their entirety, but it is an unfortunate ""maintenance"" cost you'll have to look forward to with most Bose Headphones.

A my rating suggests, I would recommend these to someone looking for good noise-cancelling headphones, but I think it's important that people know that theirs a 35-45 dollar ear cushion renewal fee for their long-term use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I thought that by now the wireless version would be excellent too.  I was wrong.  I installed the apps for my laptop and my iPhone 6 and paired the headphones to both.  I think I'll be returning them.
Good:
 • Comfortable
 • Light weight
 • Announces battery strength and paired devices when you turn them on
 • Microphone works very well for calls in both my home office and a very busy client site.
 • Extremely easy to pair to a device
Bad:
 • Garbled music!  Music from Laptop is very often garbled and the overall sound quality is bad.
 • They seem cheaper.  Not that they are, they are very well built, but I think in their striving for light weight they made them feel a bit cheaper.
 • While on a call on the laptop (Skype usually) other desktop alerts or any iPhone activity interrupts the call for at least 10 seconds or more.  I've had to ask people to repeat the couple minutes of a discussion because of this.  It should just mute the call by 20% and overlay the alert message so I don't miss anything.
 • Continuously announces that the iPhone is paired when it has a message like a text  that you have not dismissed yet.

It picks up the smallest details...which I wasn't used to, which is how I almost snapped my own neck. I was listening to music and a subtle noise that directionally sounded like it came from behind me, scared the bejesus out of me to the point I snapped my head around so fast I nearly incapacitated myself.

The battery life is great on these, even when you don't use them for awhile they still retain their charge. They charge relatively fast too. You can use them with the aux cable without turning them on also which uses extremely minimal amounts of the battery.

They are very comfortable, coming from a guy that wears glasses and has big ears, I have worn these for hours without discomfort.

I don't have a lot of experience with noise cancellation but it seems to work good to me, I've actually put the headphones on and used the noise cancellation to take a nap.

I watch a lot of TV and movies with them and have them hooked to my amazon fire stick, the only down side is if you want to use them with bluetooth on another device while near the fire stick you either have to go onto the fire stick and disconnect the headphones or unplug it.

My only MILD gripe is having to install a Bose app on my phone to update the firmware and change what the left side button does (I use mine to adjust the noise cancellation but it can be used for Alexa or Google assistant too)

I can't 100% say it is or isn't worth the money because I have never had an equally expensive headset but I would recommend these to anyone as I have been very happy with the sound and build quality. They even come with a high quality case to store them in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Unfortunately I thought that the ANC would work with pretty much everything, but that's my own fault for not making proper research. The ANC does block out lower pitched noises very well, but it won't block voices/music from outside since it can't really convert the waves so fast and cancel them. Still, when there's music on, I can't hear anything at all. I was hoping I could use this for pure silence, without music, but I guess that's still impossible! Nonetheless, amazing fit, it's super comfortable. All earphones/headphones I had prior to this would start hurting my ear about 1 hour in. This one I could spend hours and hours wearing and it would still be comfortable. Very light as well. I'm hoping it keeps this way.

First the backstory:  bought them, set them up, and enabled the Alexa helper.  All worked fine.  Charged them overnight.  Disabled Bluetooth on the phone,  then re-enabled.

And then:

- Alexa stopped working.
- Alexa app wouldn’t pair
- So after an hour of reading and trying everything online, still no Alexa.
- So I try to clear the Bluetooth list as Bose suggests.
- Headphones pair again, but still no Alexa.
- Clear Bluetooth devices again, and restart everything (phone etc).
- Alexa still won’t work.
- Clear everything again, delete Bose Connect, restart everything, reinstall Bose Connect, and re-pair.  Still no Alexa.
- Reoeat all previous steps but add in another device restart.
- Now the headphones won’t re-pair at all; all pairing attempts fail.

Total time wasted on something that should be dead simple: multiple hours.  Outcome: headphones won’t pair at all and are totally useless.

So where to begin?

- First, the Bluetooth pairing is terrible and unreliable.  It is utterly baffling how a user simply toggling Bluetooth on or off, nor doing ANYTHING with software settings, could break some core functionality of the device.  That’s just terrible engineering.  Bose needs to do better.

- No hardware reset.  So, if things go seriously sideways as they did here, there is no way to totally clear settings and set up from scratch.  Honestly, who does that?  Who builds a hardware device that can be set up only one time and can NEVER be reset to factory settings again?  That’s just crazy.  What if something goes wrong?  What if the settings get jacked up somehow and and nothing works to fix them?  Just replace the hardware?  Just seriously deficient.

None of this stuff should have happened.  It should not be possible for settings to get this munged.  So the fact that they can is a serious mark against these headphones.  A product this bad shouldn’t be sold.  I bought these for my son, but I have a pair of Sony MX1000/M3.  They are leaps and bounds better in every respect, starting with the fact that they just work without requiring a person to be a software engineer to figure them out or fix them when their software and firmware setting get jacked up,

Bose: if your product is this fragile, for crying out loud at least include a factory reset.  I’ve not been this disappointed in a product in a long, long time.

TL; DR: Do not buy these unless you are a masochist who enjoys pain.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They always felt like a luxury item...but little did I know they would become the most important productivity tool in my work bag.

The Bluetooth connectivity is great—better than any Bluetooth headphones I’ve ever owned (which ranged from cheapies to B&O). Sound quality is crystal clear, the microphone is great. People tell me they’ve never heard me so clearly.  And on top of all that, they’re incredibly comfortable.

I spend a lot of my time on conference calls, on planes, or writing in noisy environments. These have been life changing in all three circumstances. The only negatives: the Bose app can be a little wonky, and for some reason, the Google Assistant app seems to add a second instance of the headphones to my phone, which interferes with answering the phone, using Siri, etc., but that doesn’t happen often.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I compared them to several other headphones, including an 8 year old pair of cord-only bose triports, and the Plantronics backbeat 2 wireless noise cancelling headset, and these are the worst sounding headphones I own.  Almost no bass and they simply cannot handle some types of music.  But, the comfort and noise cancelling feature almost make up for the lack of sound quality.

Pros:
1. Comfort!  These are ultra-comfortable, pillow soft, around-the-ear bliss
2. Noise cancelling - best in the business.  2 levels of NC... much better than my Plantronics backbeat 2.
3. Phone voice call quality - these are excellent to use as a phone headset, even better than my Plantronics.

CONS:
1.  The bluetooth 4.1  distance is only 100 feet, 3x less distance than the Plantronics backbeat 2 which is 4.2
2.  Cannot control volume while cord is connected.  With the Plantronics backbeat 2, you can.
3.  2.5mm cord port vs standard 3.5 port... now I need to busy a special adapter to connect to long 3.5mm cord

I own Grados, Sennheisers, other Bose, Sonys, and Beats. I just tried and returned the Sony WH1000XM3 due to their dismal call audio quality. These Bose, while not perfect, are pretty darned close.

Audio Quality: I've tried about everything I can throw at them; NPR streaming, Pandora HD, FLAC from Vox, MP3, Amazon Unlimited, Apple Music. They all sound really good. I think the app could use an EQ like Sony has to tweak them for personal preferences. Soundstage feels broad and realistic. I'm not an audiophile, but like music to sound like I'm there. Spatial information, shuffles by performers, resonant buzzes, string squeaks, little breathy inhales, those all add to the experience for me and I can hear them with these cans.

Comfort: They are light and the cups are big enough to clear the ears. The clamping force might be just a bit too tight, but I wore them for 8 hours yesterday without listening fatigue.

Connectivity: They paired with my iPhone and my work Dell laptop with no issues. They switch back and forth seamlessly. The only thing I've found amiss is that sometimes incoming calls don't default to the headphones and I have to switch the audio manually.

Call Quality: This is where they excel against the Sonys. Audio quality on both ands is crisp, clear and natural sounding. My client who complained about the Sonys didn't even know I was using headphones with the Bose. Total win here.

ANC: Really excellent. Maybe doesn't give the shocking ""whoomp"" of no noise like the Sonys, but my chatty office environment just disappears when I have these on. All I hear is my audio.

Personal Assistant: I have it set for Siri and she is no smarter unfortunately. Response is good though. Too bad she's such a dingbat.

Other little things: great packaging, really nice case, robust feel, good volume, long battery life.

I work from home and these are also great for canceling out construction work going on outside.

I have successfully paired both my work phone and my personal phone at the same time to these headphones and it works perfectly. I can listen to music on my personal phone but still be connected for calls on my work phone.

I’m no audiophile, but the sound quality is wonderful.  Bass is solid without being overwhelming too.

Noise cancellation - I know these aren’t supposed to be used for canceling out a battery powered lawn mower hum, but they out preformed the i30 on that feat.  As for what they’re supposed to cancel out, ambient noise and people talking?  They’re far superior too, don’t expect them to mute the whole world though.

I'd never spend this kind of money on myself for headphones. I usually buy $10 ones and am pretty happy. Not any more. Once I used these for a few days, it's a pain going back to anything else. The kids didn't believe me when I said I couldn't hear what they were saying when I had the noise cancelling feature enabled. Heck, I didn't even know they were talking!

I bought another pair of noise canceling headphones for 1/7th the price during a Cyber Monday sale I found on slickdeals. But I returned that other pair after 2 days. What a piece of junk. My old $10 headphones are better than the wireless noise canceling headphones in the $50-$70 range. Now I want another pair of the Bose for home (I took them to work). Ugh, I guess I'll just have to shell out the cash or wait for my birthday. I'm tired of cords catching on things anyway, or forgetting I'm wearing headphones and stepping away from the desk with them on. With the wireless ones, that's not a problem.

Sound quality is excellent. Music and videos sound great. Even with nothing playing, you can use the noise canceling feature, combined with having something over your ears, to block out a good percentage of sound.

I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.

First device:
- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.
- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.

After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.

Second device:
- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.

I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Most of the time, like many others, I use the NC headphones inflight (“never board an air[liane without them”). Along with the other promising features, the QC35 SII promises 40 hours run time in wired mode. While I would not look forward to testing that claim on a marathon series of flights, that’s impressive. Bose technology is still the uncompromising best, unless you prefer distorted sound and superfluous controls.
The bells and whistles have been well covered by other reviewers and should prove useful over time for those who make the effort to master them.
After millions of miles of inflight use, I can vouch for the “comfort” aspect of the over the ear models. My only disappointment is that Bose no longer supports its very reasonable replacement program for QC ear cups on older or discontinued models. They do deteriorate over time and the otherwise functioning unit cannot be salvaged.
I also noticed that the permanently affixed line wires for the in-ear models are flimsy and eventually fail from wear, and cannot be replaced. When I took advantage of the “discount” Bose offered to upgrade to a new in-ear set, it shipped without case or accessories and appeared to be refurbished. Why not use a double-ended line plug as supplied with the new QC35, at least that can be replaced, and an extra set should be included on the site or offered as an accessory. They will get lost or worn over time. Let’s just hope that Boise policy and service will live up to the high standards of their technology and their past commitment to support.

They have held up well under my falling asleep with them in and ending up going Through who knows what. I annoy a little more weight for matirials that feel sturdy. But as far as them holding up they have done well for me","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I’ve got good ears but I’m not a hardcore audiophile. I got these to listen to music in the house and work out with. They fit comfortably and I thought, how bad could the audio be? They sell a lot of these right? Big mistake. If you want comfort + the audio experience of thin background music with no bass and muffled highs, look no further. But if you want to feel alive and experience a range of joy and feeling with your music and aren’t completely dead inside, run the hell away. I don’t know what BOSE stands for, but it may as well be Bass Obliterated Sound Eviscerated.

Even if you aren’t middle aged, these headphones are enough to give you a midlife crisis. If this was all I had to listen to, no amount of sex or fast cars could make up for the deadening, soul numbing mediocrity of these headphones. Bring me some Ativan and a Coldplay Spotify playlist and let me end it all now. This hollow, consensual hallucination I call a life has nothing left in it for me.

DeGhoul","Less-than-impressive noise cancelling and sound drops out.","December 3, 2018","Update: 12/8/18 - I had a conversation with Amazon and we determined the headset was likely defective, so they kindly and quickly replaced them.  The replacement pair is MUCH better about the sound-dropping issue, but it still has happened a couple of times.  Noise-cancelling is still, in reality, merely noise-muffling.  For the price, they’re disappointing.  It’s nice not having a wire but I’m afraid that’s the best thing I can say about them.  My much less expensive - but wired - Street headset works as well for sound quality, if not better.  I guess sound quality is the sacrifice you have to make if you want to lose the wire.

Original review:  After having just picked up a Bose Soundwear, and being impressed with it, I splurged on the QC 35 II.  That was a mistake.  They are in no way noise-cancelling.  Noise dampening, yes.  Cancelling?  Not even close.  From the commercials, they make you think you'll be insulated from the outside world.  Nope.  The other issue I have is the moment I stepped out of my house, the music I was playing started to cut out.  This did this on all settings, including when the 'noise cancelling' was turned off.  It became so bad that when I was returning home I literally shut them off, which made them absurdly expensive ear muffs.  I turned them back on before entering the house and, while in the house, they worked fine.  So, apparently I can only use them while in a building.  That's not going to work for me.  Heck, my much less expensive, corded Star Wars Street headset muffles nearly as much extraneous sound and they're not even noise cancelling!  And they don't constantly drop the sound when I'm walking outside (because, of course, they're corded.)  At lunchtime, I turned them and music on and stepped outside.  About 5' outside the door, sure enough, the music started glitching again.  I'm torn between wanting to see if a replacement will have the same issues or just getting my money back after reading all the problems people have been having with them.  For the amount of money they're getting for these, they should be flawless.  So far, I'm 50/50 on satisfaction with the Bose products I've purchased, with this particular purchase being firmly in the ""substandard"" category.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I tried them both for several days but in the end, the Bose QC 35 was my choice, which wasn't an easy one to make.  You can't go wrong with either pair as they are both very nice headphones.  The final decision for me was whether I wanted a little better quality (Sony) or better fit/comfort (Bose).  I chose comfort and the Bose 1000XM2.  Here are some other things I noticed...

SOUND QUALITY:
No question at all, the Sony 1000Xm2 are better sounding headphones.  Don't get me wrong, the Bose are still very good.  However, I really liked and preferred the bass response of the Sony over the Bose.  Bose are the brighter sounding headphones but the biggest difference was how they sound with bass, which Sony does better.

FIT / COMFORT:
The Bose gets the edge on fit/comfort.  They are VERY comfortable and light!  The Sony 1000xm2 are fine but they fit a bit more snug than Bose.  At first, I actually preferred the Sony fit.  However, after having them on for an hour or longer, that's where I noticed the biggest difference... ear fatigue.  Much less ear fatigue with the Bose.  That all being said, what is more comfortable to me might be less comfortable to you.  You just have to try them on, ideally for extended periods of time.  I bought these particularly when I fly where I plan to wear them for hours at a time.  Even though I prefer the sound quality of the Sony, I just couldn't get over the incredibly comfortable fit of the Bose.

BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY:
Both do a fine job here but the Bose were the more reliable in establishing a connection without having to fiddle around with settings.  When comparing the Sony and the Bose, I often went back and forth trying when trying out the headphones.  Every time that I went back to the Bose, it was fast and easy.  With the Sony pair, I had to go into my Bluetooth settings a few times in order to get a connection.  It really wasn't a big deal but the Bose gets the edge here because it is painless and works more reliably.

DURABILITY:
I won't give either pair the edge here because I only had them for a week BUT do keep in mind that the Sony 1000xm1 had issues with the headband cracking.  Because Sony hasn't clearly stated whether they resolved the issue with the xm2's, it's anyone's guess.  This alone probably wouldn't keep me from going with the XM2's but it is something to consider.

CONTROLS:
I like them both and consider this a toss up.  With the Sony pair, you just swipe the headphones to control the music and volume while the Bose has hard buttons.  At first, I definitely preferred the hard buttons that are on the Bose.  However, after getting used to swiping on the Sony's, I found it easy enough to do.  Which do I prefer?  Probably the hard buttons because they are a bit more reliable than the swiping.  This is very subjective though and I could see some preferring the swiping while others preferring the hard buttons.  It just depends on what you like.  For me, I found both to work fine.  The Sony does have a feature where you can put you hand over the right headphone and it will allow you to hear outside noise without having to take them off.  Cool feature?  Maybe for some but for me, I didn't see any use for it.  If someone approaches me while wearing big headphones like these, I'm going to take them off my head rather than keeping them on with my hand cupping the right headphone.  It just seems a bit rude not to do so.

FEATURES:
They both have their pluses and minuses here.  It really depends on what is most important to you.  I really like how the Sony 1000XM2 allows you to customize the sound (including equalizer).  It also has the ability to modify you settings depending on where you are listening to them by simply pressing a button.  I don't really no what impact that has though because I only tried this a couple of times.  The fact of the matter is that Sony provides a bit more customization which I like!  The Bose has google assistant which I found to be a cool feature.  I could live without this but it is a nice feature.  The feature that I found VERY useful on the Bose is the ability to play text messages through the headphones.  I was on a flight recently where we were waiting for our turn to take off.  While listening to my music, I was notified that I had a text message.  Instead of having to reach for my phone (Sony) the Bose pair allowed me to just push the action button to hear the text.  I found this awesome.  Sony does not have this feature.  What headphones gets the edge?  For me, it's another toss up.  I really like the customization of the Sony but the Bose are very cool with being able to read my text messages (and google assistant).

LOOKS:
They both look great!  I had the gold/beige Sony's and the silver Bose.  I might give a slight edge to Bose as I like the silver look and the Bose logo on each headphone.  However, this is very subjective.

SUMMARY:
This is one of those times where you just can't go wrong with either pair.  They both have their pros and cons but in the end, for me, I prefer the Bose QC 35 by a very small margin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Totally usable but the detail and presence just aren't present (heh).

Everything else is great, though. The noise canceling works very well, and even when it's turned off there is a fair amount of passive isolation. They are *very* comfortable and quite light. Build quality seems quite good; there's a thoughtful use of different materials throughout and there's no creaky plastic. Battery life also seems very good, and they charge relatively quickly.

The software side also seems to be in decent shape. I've had occasional weird connection issues but overall things work better than I generally expect.

I""m only dinging one star for the audio quality because it's fine and I'm sure the other constraints on closed-back wireless noise-canceling headphones with great battery life make it difficult to achieve sound like other headphones at the same price point but with none of those constraints.

Strong and detailed bass, clear mids and crystalline highs. Great sound.

Active noise cancellation is very effective amazing for public transportation and school.

Very comfortable on the ears.

Long battery life, I've never had a problem with it running out before I get to a charger.

Bluetooth connects fast and stays paired reliably.

Cons:
Since, the clamping force is pretty light, there is a slightly annoying pressure on the top of your head. I wish the top headband was a little thicker.

ANC gave me a giant headache on the first two days, but it feels completely fine now that I'm used to it so I don't care.

The pros of these headphones dwarf the cons, so I'm giving them 5 stars.

noise cancelling is comparable to the XM2 but inferior to the XM3 whose noise cancelling is noticeably better.
comfort of wearing the headphones: i feel these are more comfortable than both the XM2,XM3.  the sonys are comfortable, just less so.
comfort of use: the bose have physical buttons, which i prefer over sony's touch interface.
another advantage the bose has over the sonys is that i managed to connect it simultaneously to two devices. i did not manage this with the sonys. you can pair them with more than one, but i could not connect them simultaneously. this basically means i use the bose when i am at home because i like being connected to my laptop and my phone. the switch between laptop and phone is automatic and usually good. some bugs, but overall, worth it.

to sum it up, i will use the bose when i wanna connect to two devices, and the XM3 when i want superior noise cancellation and bass for music, which usually means when i go to the gym, or on flights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I can't hear a single thing when I turn these on. I was looking for headphones that canceled out noise in the background even when I wasn't listening to music (I'm a med student and need constant quiet while studying), and these work really well. Here are some details about the features:

Features: On the right headphone, there are 3 buttons aligned vertically, the volume-up button, the pause button, and the volume-down button. This is also where the On button is. On the left headphone, there is a button for Google Assistant, which I highly recommend. Just get the Bose app for headphones and the Google Assistant app and it'll help you through the set-up. You can even use them on multiple devices at the same time. I use it on my Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Just turn on Bluetooth for all your devices and turn on the headphones and it should connect automatically. Google Assistant is like Siri. These also allow you to speak into them as it has a mic, so if someone calls you are able to talk through these without picking up your phone.

Noice-Canceling Feature Only (No music): If someone in the background is cooking or cleaning I can't hear a thing with these turned on. With just the noise cancelation and no music, I can't hear the dishwasher or even certain levels of music playing in the background. I can hear conversation but really low which doesn't bother all that much. The noise canceling is really good.

Noice-Canceling Feature WITH Music/Video/Sound On: I can't hear a thing! People have to scream if they need to talk to me. Not only does it cancel out all noice in the background, you don't need to turn the volume up all the way and kill your ears in order to hear the sound playing. It's like being in a movie theater. The sound is outstanding and clear!

Overall great headphones that do the job right!

ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.

Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn't go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose's website. These are getting returned.

If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain't broke don't fix it.

Notes:
-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times. No dice.
-This ANC issue happened on the original QC 35 too
-google assistant initiated update WITHOUT prompting ""yes or no"". This happened when opening the app.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.

1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.

2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.

Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.

Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

NEGATIVES:
- The sound over the Bluetooth connection is simply awful. At best, it's like listening to AM radio, with a muffled high end, muddy mids and dead bass. At worst, it drops out, distorts, skips, makes bizarre low-frequency digital beeps and loses most of the frequency band. This is what I would expect from a $9.95 pair of cans, not one that costs over 30x more than that.

- The Bluetooth connection has an effective, reliable range of only 3-6 feet (and even then, the sound quality is as described above!) At just 10 feet, it often starts dropping out and skipping. Going around a corner inside a house, even if it's only 10 feet away, normally kills the connection. Going 15 causes it to disconnect. This was the same on two different laptops and a mobile phone, so it's definitely a headphone issue.

- You cannot use the headphones while charging. Seriously?

- The included audio and USB cables are a joke -- the former is maybe 2 ft long and so thin it seems bound to wear out in weeks; the latter is maybe 3 inches long.

- The built-in volume controls only work over Bluetooth, which is unlistenable.

- The synthesized voice that tells you about various headphone statuses cuts out to the point of unintelligibility.

I would gladly pay $29.95 for these headphones knowing that the Bluetooth is essentially unusable. At the price they're sold at, however, these headphones are a massive disappointment.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I live in New York City and work from home near a busy road.  There is noise all around me - heating, refrigerator fan, light fixtures, traffic, incessant honking and sirens, neighbors playing music loudly.  After the first time I tried them and turned them off, I thought, wow why is my room so loud all of a sudden, what is that?  It turns out it was just the everyday noise I've been surrounded by.  That's how incredibly silent my world becomes when I put these on.

Granted, like other reviewers have mentioned, the world won't actually become completely silent, but it'll get as close as you can to it.  For me, as someone who has a case of misophonia, these do such a great job that I can focus on my work so much better.  They make a world of difference.  Sometimes I just leave them on without music.

Bonus points for the Bluetooth connectivity and the mic.  I now take all my work phone calls on this.  I have connections to my work laptop, my work cell phone, and my personal cell phone.  I can stream music to it, pause, take a call, and resume my music.  I've been told the receiving end hears me very clearly.

Yes, $350 is a lot of money.  I originally had no intention to get these; i wasn't considering them at all.  I was looking at the QC 25s (wired).  But after spending time reading reviews and making the decision that this was something necessary because the noise was impacting my concentration on work, I pulled the trigger.  Going wireless is sooo much better than being chained down to my phone or computer.

Definitely a worthy investment if you experience similar conditions as me or simply enjoy silence!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I bought it because I often forget taking ...","September 22, 2018","So far so good.I bought it because I often forget taking earbuds on flights and have to buy them on flights which I quickly loose before my return trip! So I thought maybe carrying a sizeable wireless headphone will solve the problem considering the significant size.Additionally, it helps to watch and listen to TV program at home when others are doing their own thing without me distracting them.

Pros:
1.Sound quality is good.I like that the equalizer self adjusts to the sound continuously and you do not have to make any manual adjustment. The sound it delivers is undiluted. It is as rich as the sound coming out from our old Phillips surround speakers connected to an OPPO audio/video system.
2.The cancellation effect is excellent.At a high level, it effectively cancels out all external ""noises"".  For safety reason, I use it on the low level so I can still be aware of my surrounding.
3.It is very comfortable on my ears.I do not just place the ear piece over my ears .I deliberately make sure I place it over my ears coming from a back approach.That way the ear lobe sits into the recess and no pressure is applied on my ears.Then I push the piece up but not pull it down as one would normally do.Compared to prior headphones I had worn many years back for listening to music, my ears do not get uncomfortably warm after a prolong use, by prolong use, I mean wearing it for 20 minutes or more.I have worn this headphones for 5 hours continuously without feeling any discomfort of warmth or pressure to my ears.
4.Have not tested the limit  of the battery life.But as noted above, it has  served me for 5 hours of continuous use.Also,I make sure I charge it after each use. I believe that the battery life will even be longer than it is today.
5.The unit is not heavy to carry but I think that as the technology improves that lighter materials will be used to make it lighter. I have not tried using it to make hand free calls with my phone.Other reviewers say that, that feature works well.
6.Reconnecting to any bluetooth devise automatically has always been smooth and seamless. Has excellent memory. Have not tried other brands to compare with, I doubt I can afford to do that.I am happy with this wireless headphone and will recommend it.

Cons:
1. Expensive.
2.The manual that came with it was not very helpful.

My wishes:
1.That the system automatically shut itself off after 20 seconds of being taken off from the ears, if it does not detect any pressure from the ear pieces.This will save the battery life.
2.That it has a storage compartment in it you can store the wired cable.
3.That it comes with an ""instructive"" instruction manual. I had to go online to download a manual that made more sense.
4.That I do not have to take it off my ears to listen to someone talking to me. Planatronics unit I have read has a feature to overcome this little incovenience. By placing your palm over the right ear piece makes you hear external sound and temporarily pauses the internal sound.Removing your palm, resumes the internal sound and cancels out the unwanted external source of sound.Boss could learn a thing from Planatronics here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Action button is a disaster","February 28, 2019","Absolutely horrible. Bose are good when they're not Bluetooth. I literally have had 3 pairs (I know... burn me once...) and they've all been really horrible. I currently own 2 pair. I just couldn't believe they could be this bad and kept giving them a second and third chance. I assumed I was having bad luck. Not true. Same results on all of them. In fact, one has an extra special annoying problem, unique to itself, which I'll get to in a minute. For one, the ""Action"" button is a total catastrophe and the Bose app sucks hard. Regardless of whether I set this button to Google Assistant, Alexa or nose cancellation intensity... the headphones continuously ask me to connect to the Bose app. This isn't only from time to time, but amazingly and annoyingly extremely often. It's not just an initial set-up thing. No. That would make too much sense. This is constant. Also, I with my 2  pairs (so I always have one around the house, etc.... again...I admit I'm a moron for doing this and not returning them) they both have the dreaded, sporadic Bluetooth signal cut out. I would think for this price, that wouldn't happen. The $20 MPOW Bluetooth headphones I bought for the gym don't ever cut out using the same phone I use with Bose. Lastly, Bose gave me an extra special treat with 1 of the 2 headphones. This beauty won't just simply play as a commoner would expect. I have to first press play, second, press the amazing Action button (sarcasm), third, hear ""you have no new messages"", then finally press play on my phone in order for it to play. This headset also won't play if I use Google Assistant. It just sits there. My advice is to buy any other brand. I'm never buying Bose again. There are other brands now which have caught up with the noise cancelling feature. Bose is stuck in the 90's. The owners clearly are lazy and don't want to make improvements.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

[1] Bose QuietComfort 35 (Series II) Wireless Headphones, Noise Cancelling ($349.00)

[2] Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless Bluetooth ($348.00)

[3] Beats Studio3 Wireless Headphones ($298.99)

I put on the Beats and the heaviness and fit gave me the sense of an impending headache the instant I put them on. That, and the sound was empty and flat compared with either Sony or Bose. What was most surprising to me was they didn't have strong bass, which I had thought they were known for.

I put on the Sony and they were bigger but somewhat better fitting, not a lot lighter, but with more of a clear and full range from high to low.

I put on the Bose and it was surprisingly and significantly lighter and better fitting than either of the others and the sound was basically perfect. Good bass, full range of highs and lows.  I have to admit that I had to switch back and forth between the Sony and the Bose about 10 times to determine if I *really* preferred the Bose to the Sony, and they were actually pretty darn close. The final element that tilted the scales in favor of Bose was they were so much lighter and better fitting, which was paramount for me since I'd be using them for exercise, so I took a 1/10th of a point of the Sony. If I was the type of person who uses headphones for sitting around enjoying music, the weight and fit would be less important and the music quality would be almost everything, and then I'd probably have to switch between the Bose and Sony another 10-20 times to figure out what the difference is and what I prefer. It's subtle; equal but different. It may come down to a matter of individual preference and the type of music you listen to.

In addition to all of the above, as I've continued to use the Bose for 'everything' - I was most surprised when on a whim I decided to see if I could place a call with them; and my two initial callers both exclaimed that this was the BEST and clearest sound talking to me they had yet experienced (For years I've tried their patience through testing calls with 10-15 different best rated wired and wireless headpieces, ear buds et al).  The rave reviews of the recipients of my calls carried from inside to outside walking the streets of NYC with all the usual sirens and traffic noise.

But most important of all, I can listen to my music in full head-filling gorgeous energizing glory when I'm exercising.

Bose 5 stars
Sony 4.9 stars

I ordered at least 4 or 5 other brands. Either didn't fit my-I guess short female head. Or they quit working within a week. Came not working, or the sound was pitiful.
The ear pads feel great. Soft & just perfect around my ear.
Controls are very intuitive compared to the other brands. I love the on/off/pair on the upper side of the right ear piece. I have short arms & older fingers. Searching & searching for the up/down or on/off ""under"" the ear piece was awful for me. the volume is under the right ear piece but it''s all your fingers are looking for there. Once I set the sound on a movie for example I rarely need to change the volume with these headphones.
I like the the noise canceling button on the left is all you need to deal with too.
The noise canceling with Bose AR is the best I could have asked for. Battery lasts a long ""binging"" time.
Bluetooth is easy to set up & reconnects almost immediately. If needed to turn off push right side button to right & you are in business again.
Worth the money in every respect. I wasted time & money trying not to spend this much money. Retired-limited funds. Oh my Gosh how happy I am I just pushed order on these headphones & ignored the $299 this time.
I hate to have even one negative because it is only really my problem. That is the mute ability.
For me I can't do it. I really miss muting quickly. The option is there the directions say. I accomplished it one time. But maybe due to my awkward old fingers & position of the muting button in between the off & on volume I have just given up trying to mute all together. I just take the head phones off my head to not hear some things because I love all else about these headphones so much. I pray next model will have a completely separate, easy to do, mute button added away from the volume buttons. Something Quick. Such as right ""under"" the right on/off/pair button. Not beside to confuse my fingers. Or better on the left outside ear piece in same place the on/off/pair button is on the right earpiece. Away from NC button.
My son is particular with his headphones. Has several for different purposes & work. He liked these so much he decided one of his were not working right, ha, ha. He bought the next up $399 model immediately. He could not be happier. Both sound extremely clear. Oh my gosh!  I like the less bass & more inclined to treble of mine. Helps me hear better.
I can only connect to two devices at a time. We noticed he can connect to 3 or 4. (sorry not sure but at least 3).

Sure they're pricey but I can say wholeheartedly you get what you pay for. I live in a city where trains and or buses can get pretty loud and sometimes regular headphones don't block the noise out completely. These do just that and more. When you turn them on you already can tell the difference in background noise and once your music starts playing that's all you hear. You don't hear people's conversations or whatever is going on around you. The headphones adjust accordingly to many sized heads and they're very comfortable. I have Google assistant with my headphones so the button that controlled noise cancelling now can control my notifications. For instance if i get an incoming text message i can press the button to have message read to me then I can hold to reply and press one more time to send. My only small gripe with these headphones is the microphone is a little sensitive and from my own experience when I talk to someone on the phone they can hear the background noise very loudly even if it's really not that loud.

Rhoades","Bose vs. Sony: use case matters","April 8, 2019","Don’t write reviews often but I recently struggled with the decision between these headphones and the Sony wh1000mx3. I ended up purchasing both to test and landed on the Bose. First and foremost, these are both phenomenal noise cancelling headphones and most people would be happy with either. Just to name a few things I liked about each product and why I seemingly went against the grain and chose the Bose over the Sony’s:

Fit: both were extremely comfortable. I give a slight edge to the Bose as I received a little less clamping force. Mind you I have a larger sized head so most people likely wouldn’t perceive the difference.

Controls: I preferred the Sony’s controls only because I feel like everything is touch now and it felt natural. I know there is a cold weather issue but I’m mostly using these indoors in an office setting and occasional air travel.  I also preferred Sony’s inclusion of usb c.

Sound(music): simply put my ears preferred the Sony sound. The Bose sound very good (neutral) but I preferred the sound of the Sony’s.

Phone: and here is why I chose the Bose. And this is where for me, my use case meant the Sony’s were not an option. The Sony’s were unusable on work conference calls. Even in a quiet environment other participants couldn’t hear me. The Bose were exceptional in this regard. Also, the ability of the Bose to connect to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously is invaluable (for my use case).

In summation, both are great headphones and you should really determine your use case before deciding.  For me, the Bose voice quality and the seamless Bluetooth connectivity between multiple devices out weighed the Sony’s exceptional noise cancelling, controls, and audio sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The best feature about them is comfort. They fit over my ears so they were not pressing on my ears at all. I also wear glasses and they were not pressing into the sides of my glasses. I was able to wear them for hours without any discomfort. I synced them with my tablet to watch shows and movies on the flight. The sound quality was really good and the bluetooth worked great. There is also a cord to plug in to devices if you don't want to use the bluetooth. I think the noise cancellation feature works good, but not great. It blocked out some of the loud plane engine noises and some surrounding noises, but not everything completely. There were crying children on the flight which I heard through the headphones. I guess I expected them to block out all surrounding noise completely instead of just muffling the sounds.

One of the best on the market and it should be for the relative price.
Warning about Bose service/support policies.
Just 2 months after the 12 mo warrantee ran out I had the right side of the headset come apart from the headpiece.  The culprit was a small screw which could have easily been shipped to replace the lost one.  I called Bose and the only option they offered was to replace the Unit for about $300. They clearly stated their policy was to replace at a very small and unreasonable trade in. Absolutely ridiculous in this case for a small screw.
Bottom line: Bose repair policy is way out of reasonable and so ridged one cannot imagine.  If I could rate Bose customer support in this case it would be a whopping zero.

I made the mistake of trying these on at some point in the past, being amazed, then attempting to duplicate the experience with a much cheaper substitute. The quality of the the noise cancellation, the quality of the sound, the comfort, and the physical construction are all far, far superior on the Bose device. If you are looking for the best noise cancelling experience around, you'll need to pay for it, and you will likely not be disappointed here.

Just a word about expectations: these cancel ambient, background noise: airplanes, airports, air conditioners, white noise, etc. They do not silence (or really even quiet) conversation, screaming babies, fireworks, shotgun blasts, pneumatic tools, bowling alleys, breaking glass, car alarms, fire alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, falling cookware, crash symbols, and the like.

Cheaper headphones also produce poor sound quality that seems to be affected by their own noise cancellation. With Bose, you're getting top quality noise cancellation without sacrificing in sound quality - and that's sound that's coming from Bose speakers! If you fancy yourself ANY flavor of audiophile, some headphones of this quality will be your baseline. Cheaper imitations warrant no discussion.

The battery life is excellent, and they charge quickly. These are not the cheapest headphones in town, but in this reviewer's opinion, they are the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I decided to pick up some ANC headphones after getting tired of the in ear buds I had been using for years. I desired a better range but also needed something with supreme comfort as I listen for hours on end while studying. A lot of people have been comparing these to a couple other sets so I will leave my thoughts around those as well.

QCII: Best comfort. Well-rounded sound. Great build quality (glass fiber reinforced nylon, or so I have read). User replaceable ear pads. One thing to note is the good but uninspiring sound. It is far from poor but it has sort of a muted feel. I suppose this allows them to have good marks across a wide range of genres. Can't blame them for that. I'm satisfied with the sound as they are definitely an improvement from the hf5 buds I had been using. Google assistant is cool but I don't care about it. I have that button set to adjust ANC (high, low or off). Where is the airplane adapter? Stupid to leave it out. Also to consider - there are massive issues with Bluetooth pairing in Windows 7. It can be argued that this is not their responsibility but it's still frustrating. For those having issues search up Toshiba Bluetooth drivers for Bose - this workaround solved the issue for me. Also note that this issue is not specific to Bose. The Win7 Bluetooth stack is just garbage so you may have issues pairing with any modern wireless device.

Sony WH-1000XM2: Definitely wins in the features category. Superior battery life, more lively sound, great equalizer customization in the app, touch controls and LDAC support. I kept finding myself wanting to listen to these more than the QCII. However, I could not overlook the build quality issues with reports of headband cracking. Unacceptable and not worth the risk for me. Also, I have larger ears and they were less comfortable with noticeable heating. The QCII have more space within the ear cups. The pads also got quite thin at the base of the ear during wear. This didn't compromise the seal but after removal it stayed flat and did not readily go back to a plush conformation. This may seem like a very particular critique but longevity is a concern for me and I could not help but think how long the cushioning would last. Add on top the fact that you cannot replace the ear pads and I had to rule them out.

B&W PX: Amazing sound and superb sound stage. Unfortunately, too many negatives. They are heavy and caused a hot spot at the top of my head after less than an hour of use. The build quality was amazing and they looked fantastic but it was just too much weight. Sound quality takes a big hit with ANC enabled. You also cannot use them passively without battery power. They also do not collapse for easy storage. It's a shame since they sounded so good but I could not live with these downsides. Maybe the next version will fix some of these issues. I've read the P7 is a good option for those not requiring ANC.

Ultimately it depends what you value. The combination of comfort and build quality with above average sound is what sold me. I hate to compromise but that's what you need to do at this price point. An ideal product would incorporate the Bose comfort, B&W sound and Sony features.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I received the Sony first and used them for a couple of days off and on with one session being 2 hrs. The features of these are awesome! So easy to setup and use. The app was also easy and lots of features to adjust the headphones. The touch pad though sensitive, i got used to keeping my hand away from it except when needed and i really like the Pause feature and Vol. The noise cancellation is top notch and the best of the two. I could not hear anything outside the headphone and a muffle sound when my wife was talking to me. Sound is amazing though i thought it was a little bass heavy.  My initial feeling was it was definitely a keeper! But that changed after that 2 hr session. The headphone started to feel heavy and though i am not to sensitive to the use of head gear as i ride a motorcycle and spent many many years on a US Navy Flight Deck, the headphone were getting a bit warm and uncomfortable around the ears.
I received the Bose and was just as easy to set up. The app is not as feature rich as the Sony but has the basics required. Used the Bose for a 2 hr session also and though it was a bit warm also not as much as the Sony. It was not as heavy as the Sony. The sound on the Bose was not as detailed as the Sony but pretty close on all the genres of music i listen to.  I also noticed that the distance between the Bluetooth source and the headphones on the Bose is not as far as the Sony but plenty of distance. The Noise Cancellation is not as good as the Sony but it did muffle most sounds around though i was able to hear the floor fan and i could talk to my wife without taking the headphones off. The controls on the Bose seem primitive compared to the Sony but it works well and easy to use.
In the end, i ended up keeping the Bose as they were more comfortable to wear for extended times. If i was just looking for a headphone for short periods of use, I would definitely go with the Sony but I needed these headphones for use of extended times. The sound is solid and enjoyable and the Noise Cancellation feature is tolerable.
Once i get more use and utilize more of its features, i will update.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Loud and annoying crackling noise when airplane takes-off or lands.","February 1, 2019","First time I used my new headset on a flight this week.  I settled in my seat and set the headset's noise cancelling level to high, connected to my phone and began listing to music.  Everything was good.  However I about jumped out of my seat once the jet engines revved up for takeoff. There was a loud, pronounced, and annoying crackling noise in both sides of the headset that lasted until we were airborne.  The same thing happened after touchdown when the jet engine's reverse thrusters kicked-in.  It seems the noise cancelling capabilities were overwhelmed and couldn't handle level of noise produced by the jet engines during take-off and landing.  I never experienced this problem with my old Bose Quiet Comfort 25 headset.  Also, they performed very poorly cancelling out voice conversations around me, a baby crying behind me, and the flight attendant's intercom announcement.  My old Bose QuietComfort 25 were excellent at cancelling out all these sounds.  After the flight, I searched on Bose's web site and found that mine was not an isolated experience.  Others shared similar experiences with their headsets and were equally disappointed. Bose tech support posted replies to the complaints stating that is was normal.  Needless to say I'm very disappointment with the performance of the QuietComfort 35 (Series II) and will be returning them for a refund.

I'll keep it short. I read the reviews of the Sony WH1000XM2 and the Bose QuietComfort 35 II and could not decide which to choose, so I bought both. I returned the Sony and kept the Bose. Here are the pros and cons:

Sony:
+ Crisper highs and deeper bass (I can't see how anyone says the Bose model sounds better)
+ Better song navigation with the figure gestures on side of right headpiece
- When making phone calls, those on the other end hear more of your background noise than on the Bose (I tested by calling from a land line to a family member who used my Sonys)
- Heavy on the head and hurts to wear for long periods (this was a deal breaker for me)
- Finger navigation feature is too sensitive sometimes - easy to skip/rewind songs by accident.

Bose
+ Great noise cancellation, especially with no music (better than Sony's)
+ Light weight and definitely more comfortable for long periods
+ Best for phone calls (those on other end don't hear much background noise)
- Sound is missing crispness at high and low ends; overall sounds are a bit muffled (it would be great to get Sony's sound on these speakers). If music quality is your deal breaker, buy the Sonys for sure.

In the end, I couldn't get over the uncomfortable aspect of the Sonys. I really preferred the Sony sound, but didn't see myself wearing the Sonys for long periods of time. My primary reason for buying these was muffling office and plane engine noise for long periods of time, therefore comfort was a deal breaker. It also helps that I can take conference calls on the Bose headsets and not worry about those on the other end hearing lots of background noise.

Both lose one star due to their respective shortcomings, but for my use the Bose was the winner. After owning them for about 5 months, I'm very happy I chose them.

I didn't realize the kinds of ambient noise I had around me until after I used this for a while. I bought other fancy headphones in the past, which usually had cables and ended up broken when I tripped across it. These are wireless, with a volume control built in. (You can still plug them in if you like, but I never do that.)

When I got them in the mail, they worked perfectly. Then, after an update, for a while, the software was a bit glitchy and would randomly beep. But at some point they must've fixed that in another update, after a year or so. Because they work perfectly again.

One downside is that the microphone isn't really worth having on it. In order to use the microphone, you have to put the headphones into ""headset"" ""communications device"" mode, which doesn't properly do sound cancelling. Worse, it sounds like someone is playing back the audio from outside the headphones. I never use that mode, because I can't stand it.

I also wish that I could stream (mix) two wireless sources at once. While speaking on the microphone. I often want to listen to a show on one device, and a video game on another, while possibly talking into a microphone. There isn't a solution for this. For my purpose, I connect to a small bluetooth adapter, and plug that into the line-in jack on my PC. Then I check the ""listen to this"" button for that line-in, so that I can hear the second audio source.

But despite any and all drawbacks, I am very happy with my headphones and would buy them again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I would have liked more if the white portion was also rose gold. i try not to wear them when i'm wearing face make up or i was my face/hair before wearing them because i don't want to get those white portions dirty. very simple to use. nice rounded sound, could use more bass unfortunately. noise cancellation is great, i use it when sleeping at my gf's house because her family is very loud.
unfortunately, you can't pair this to anything, even if you download the bose connect+ app. it only pairs to my iphone via bluetooth. if i want to listen to music using this headphone on my laptop or old android phone, i need to use the wire. i'm going to see if it connects via bluetooth to modern samsung phones soon. really wish it could at least pair to my laptop.
it's a bit heavy on your head at first, but you get used to it. i'm still too scared to wear it in public because it's so pretty i feel like someone will just run by and steal it off my head if i'm not paying attention.
i really don't use the google assistant/alexa button ever. if you use siri or whatever a lot, it would be useful to you.
calls are crystal and people say i sound clear. people have said if i have the volume about halfway, they can hear what i'm listening to, which i don't like.
overall, these headphones are a gem. definitely very expensive, but i plan on using these for a very long time. battery life is good. i'm not a heavy headphone user. i've charged it once since getting it (couple months ago) and have just reached 60%.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Issue #1 - noice cancelling crackles during airplane takeoff. Given Bose sells aviation headsets, this is something they should have figured out how to do but for reason the roar of the airplane engines is too high for the headphones noise cancellation system to handle.

Issue #2 - audio will cut out out of the blue when connected to multiple devices. For example, if you are connected to your computer's bluetooth for a very important Zoom or Webex meeting and you forgot to turn off your phone's bluetooth, you will lose your computer audio at some point during the call, quite unexpectedly. You will then be left to fumble your phone to try and disconnect the phone bluetooth connection and get your computer audio working again, all while the other people on the line are wondering why you're no longer responding.

Issue #3 - After about 6 months of using these headphones, the right side no longer plays any sound while connected to computer audio. Thankfully, this is something Bose support offered to fix at no charge, however they seem to be unable to send me the return shipping label so I do not know if this will get resolved or not.

To recap, these headphones emit high quality Bose-like sound but I cannot recommend them because of various usability issues which appear to have been overlooked when designing these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

K.","Works great for focusing on audio/video at places with loud ambient noises","June 19, 2019","I'm using these to do some transcription and video coding work, and I was surprised at how well they blocked out noises at cafes (the cafe music and espresso machine, any echoes from people's conversations), and construction work next door to my house (which will be going on for ALL summer). Before, I never would have considered doing this kind of work (where I have to pay attention to audio very carefully) at a cafe, but these headphones enable me to do so! If you're not listening to any audio while using the noise-canceling feature, you can still hear people's conversations, but a lot of the ambient noise is cancelled out.

They are very comfortable over the ears and don't squeeze my head (or earrings) like many other headphones do. The only uncomfortable bit I've found is the top of the headphone band that rests on my head, but because the headphones are fairly light, it's not so bad.

The headphones come with a cord to directly connect to a device (I use this when I don't need to use the noise-canceling feature and want to save on battery), and the case is nice and sturdy, so I'm not worried about my expensive headphones getting crushed or damaged when jammed into my bag full of books and other junk.

I also like that the buttons are easy to find while wearing the headphones, so I can pause and play video/audio without having to click out of any note-taking windows I have up on my computer.

I was lucky to have some research funds to buy this item. Otherwise, I'm not sure if I'd be willing to shell out $300+ for this. If cost is an issue, I'd probably recommend that you rely on cheaper headphones and find quieter places to work if that is an option for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Bought these for my wife so she can be free of wires and not have to constantly change out batteries.  Sound quality and noise cancellation is way beyond satisfactory.  Although, while making a call, it seems that you are using a web based platform, like Skype or Discord.  You can hear an echo if you have a tv in the background, or you can hear someone typing as if their phone was right at the keyboard.  Was told by a Bose agent via chat  ""Karla at 14:18, Sep 18: The QC 35 has a side-tone feature. And it is perfectly normal for it to have an echo.""  Wow.  Whatever this ""side tone feature"" is, its crap.

Another thing is that the bluetooth would cut out and disconnect at random times.  Just got these not too long ago and it worked fine until a few days ago.  The headset would say ""disconnected from XXX"" and then reconnect a few seconds later.. or having to reconnect manually.  Did an update to the Bose Connect app as well, which didn't fix the connection issue.  You can connect with the aux cord they provide, but what is the point of having it being hands free?

There are many detailed reviews from self-proclaimed audiophiles on here, so I won't waste time trying to write my own. I'll just make note that while these headphones are amazing, they didn't blow me away. Prior to owning these, I owned the Cowin E7 bluetooth noise canceling headphones for almost year. Make no mistake, these Bose headphones are a lot better than the budget friendly Cowin E7s, which cost roughly $70. But for me the QC 35 just didn't offer a big enough bump in my listening experience to justify the price difference.

That being said, I am a casual music listener. When I listen to music, I am usually doing something else and I don't often focus on the music itself. I just want my headphones to produce clear music that sound reasonably close to the original recording. I can live with minor distortions and I don't need feel as like I'm in a live studio.

Other things to note:
- I don't find these headphones to be super comfortable. I know I'm in the minority here, but the cups squeeze a bit too tight for my liking.
- As others have noted, the ""noise canceling"" aspect is more like ""noise muffling"" of certain frequencies. Not a bad thing per se, but just be aware that you'll still be able to hear a conversation happening next to you.
- While the bluetooth works well most of the time, I occasionally have connectivity issues. I sometimes have to disconnect/reconnect a few times to get things going.

Bottom line:
These headphones are amazing and are probably the best on the market. However, I think most people would be just as happy with cheaper alternatives. If you're a casual listener, who mostly plays music in the background, I would recommend saving your money and getting something cheaper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

People said they could hear people in my office about 15 feet away better than they could hear me.  I really expected more out of a $350 set of headphones.  I have owned free earbuds that came with my phone that did a better job at canceling out background noise through the microphone.

Summers","Non-Bluetooth Was Better","November 8, 2019","I've used Bose headphones for 7 years now, and they're lifesavers for someone who's noise-sensitive like me.  Previous models were great against roommates, neighbors, etc. and great for traveling.  I finally opted to upgrade to bluetooth ""for convenience.""  Sigh.  The promise is so rarely as good as the reality.

BLUETOOTH PROBLEMS
The bluetooth will only support two devices at once.  ""No problem, who uses 3 devices at once?"" I thought.  Well, what they don't tell you is that it won't auto-switch between devices, so you are constantly opening the app to adjust devices if you need to switch between MORE THAN ONE.  Why one?  Because one of them always has to be your phone to use the bloody app!  So, it really only supports your phone plus one.

Bluetooth randomly disconnects.  And randomly tries to connect, beeping and beeping in your ear or just failing completely.  Pain in the @$$.

App constantly forgets the device, tries to connect with other people's devices, creates delays while it figures things out, etc.  Pain in the @$$.

NOISE CANCELLING
Noise cancelling isn't as good as previous models.  You can't just turn on the noise cancelling either like you could with the others.  It has to be audio on.

APP
App is a stupid, pathetic piece of garbage.  It's slow to connect, it's a pain to manage connections that CONSTANTLY need to be managed (HIDDEN IN A SECONDARY MENU - ARE YOU F'ING KIDDING ME!?).  And even with the stupid app I shouldn't have to use, I still can't adjust sound quality.

BASS
Bass is too strong and un-smooth.  And there's no way to adjust it.  I can't listen to some of my favorite songs through these headphones.

All I can say is that Bose better get their act together or I'm finally following my friends to other brands.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

A key aspect of my selection was the wired connection that I often need, as with in-flight entertainment systems. (I would have bought the Bose 30 earbud design but, amazingly, it lacks a wired connection). My only disappointment with the 35ii is that the audio jack is not the standard 3.5 mm (1/8 inch) style that we have known and loved for about 50 years. Instead, the phones have a 2.5 mm jack. I did not see this noted in any of the many reviews that I read---they all mention a standard audio connection. The phones come with a cable that plugs into the 2.5 mm jack and provides a standard 3.5 mm plug on the other end. But for the life of me I cannot even guess why a 3.5 mm wasn't used on the phones themselves so that any standard cable could be used. So if wired connection is important to you be advised that you may wantto buy an additional (more robust and longer) adapter cable, and I do see some on Amazon. Apparently the smaller jack is used on other headphones as well.  But why?

One of the best I've heard -- when you can get it to work.  Bluetooth setup can be a nightmare, and differs from device to device.  Bose gives several excuses on their website as to why this might be - none of them valid (one of their suggestions was to make sure the unit is turned on).  The headphones stutter when played on PC, but work great through a smartphone -- until a firmware update happens.  Then you've got to drop all of the connections, clear out Bluetooth and try again...and again....and again....  I love the sound, but hate the headphones. For the cost, I should love both. You failed on this one, Bose.

Update: I'm standing behind this being a bluetooth nightmare, but I figured out what the problem was (with no help from Bose). I've got a metal desk, and I'm guessing this is a problem because when I moved the bt dongle from the back of the PC to the front, the issue cleared up immediately.  Now, they sound great and maintain their connection.

Noise cancellation works decently but don't expect this to be of construction quality if you like listening to music while using jackhammers.  Material quality seems fragile, the item appears prone to easy breakage/tearing. The provided semi-hard case is protective but not crush-resistant.  In the online instruction book if you want to find how out how to watch movies on airplanes using the headphones, good luck finding the answer; you have to plough elsewhere through reviews and ‘questions asked’ for the answer.

In the review of the consumer magazine, it stated the claimed Bluetooth range to be 30 feet, which is the typical limit for such devices. Apparently they did not test them for this, which I find disappointing. Some of the reviews here reflect my own experience, as I can barely walk out of the room while using them. At a distance of 10 to 15 feet, the Bluetooth connection drops out when I move my head slightly from side to side. Bose claims high sound quality at all listening levels, and for the most part, I would agree. I would guess  it would involve provision for equal-loudness contour adjustment, so at low volume,  low and high frequencies would be boosted slightly.

I have been using Bose QC25 for 5 years, it was amazingly comfortable I actually slept with it on. But when the cellphone maker no longer put 3.5mm jack hole on their smart phones, I know it is the time to make a change. I waited for the Bose NC 700, but when I finally got it, it was a totally disaster. The new design makes it look cheap and hippie, the 10 level noise cancelling is not necessary at all, the new clamp design put extra pressure on head. I had to return that. Then I turned to Sony WH-1000XM3, because I have heard so many times from my friends that how much progress Sony has made to create this headphone that finally beat the Bose. But again it was another headphone with noise cancelling function. Although it has a good sound quality as any other Sony headphone, but it is not necessary for any situation when you need to turn the noise cancelling function. The other hand is that it is less flexible and wide compared to Bose25/35, so the top and side of your head will have pressure feeling after one hour. Finally I had to go back to someone I am familiar with - Bose QC35ii. When I put it on, the same comfortable feeling that I could wear to sleep for whole night, state of the art noise cancelling function, excellent sounds quality for music and movie and a phone call, last but not the least, bluetooth connection and no AAA batteries anymore. That is THE NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONE.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Fantastic headphones, so glad I saved for them and finally took the leap to buy. As soon as you put these things over your ears and power on, it's remarkable how much noise they cancel out .. and when the music starts, that's all you hear. In-between tracks you might hear some faint conversations around you, but once the music starts playing again you are back in your own world. Music sounds great thru them, and the bass (whatever level of volume you are listening to) is pitch perfect. The Google assistant (via my Android phone) works brilliantly, hands free, talk-back via the headphones is outstanding. The android app is ok, but a little annoying that it has to restart every time you go back to it even though the headphones remain active. The headphones are very comfortable, they fit like a glove ... I am extremely happy with them.

I bought them for work to cut down on extra noise and also to bring with me when I traveled for work.  The left side works perfectly, but there is something loose in the right side that I cannot seem to figure out and it rattles when the headphones vibrate, which is almost constant since sound is vibration.  Due to the close proximity to my ear, it hurts my ears too much to use and defeats the purpose of having noise cancelling headphones.  I'm probably going to send them back.

I couldn't be happier with them. They are the most comfortable over-ear headphones I've owned. They're light and cushy enough to rest over my ear and not crush the cartilage. I wore them for hours with no discomfort.

The battery life is excellent and they're easy to recharge. The noise canceling is pretty amazing. It provides 3 levels of cancellation and you don't realize how much it is doing until you switch it off. You'll still hear some minor background noise (like the sound of the jet engines), but it is very quiet and not noticeable when music is playing.

The sound quality is very good. The Bluetooth connects seamlessly to multiple devices, both my phone and laptop. I have also been using them for phone calls and the microphone works well. The noise canceling makes phone calls much clearer than my AirPods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I exchanged them for these and have been very pleased. The sound quality is way better, they are louder, and the app interface is dynamite. The noise-cancelling capability is so deep it borders on creepy. When you turn off the noise cancelling function, you get this wild rush of ambient noise that you completely forget exists when you are wired in. It is crazy how much sound these actually cut out. The interactive ear cups are also great as they give you the ability to work seamlessly almost forgetting your headphones are on. If you are making a choice between these and the comparable Bose product, go ahead and get these.

Clarity of music and Bluetooth phone capability is also exquisite. The microphone in the headset also works very well while using the Bluetooth feature to make phone calls. The speaker can be heard clearly on the other phone.
During a 737 flight, in a seat near the engine exhaust, as soon as I put on the headphones there was a glorious absence of any sound whatsoever.
While cooking and wearing the headphones, I was completely unaware that I had set off the smoke alarm until someone walked into the kitchen motioning me to remove the headphones, and low and behold that smoke alarm was screaming...
They are also very comfortable to wear for hours on end. They are not heavy which also adds to the comfort.
Battery life is also surprisingly good, even when utilizing the noise cancellation feature, and listening at a higher volume.
Would highly recommend.

Call quality, noise cancellation, and battery life is also great. I can not speak to the effectiveness to the personal assistance features of these because I don’t use them. These clamp just enough to hold on to your head but not so tight that they become uncomfortable. The headband and earmuffs are very soft and comfortable.

I owned the Bose On-Ear headphones and wanted something that would completely block out other sound, yet remain comfortable. They are fantastic and do both of those things, plus some.

When the sound canceling option is set to High, it does give me headaches and I can't listen to it that way for very long. When set on Mid, it doesn't affect me as much. I'm not sure why this is the case, but I usually find myself turning off the sound canceling option, completely defeating the purpose of the headphone's main feature. They also heat up very quickly when using the sound cancelling features. The cups are incredibly soft with a leather padding, making them quite comfortable to wear, but I believe this is the main reason they heat up so quickly. I have yet to try different ear cups, but I may do so in the near future. These two reasons are why I had to give them a 4-star rating.

These headphones produce amazing sound, don't get me wrong. I do find myself using my On-Ear headphones more than these, but they're still great. These headphones would be perfect for someone who travels and finds themselves on airplanes often. I know that's rather specific, but blocking out the sound of the plane is an amazing feature. If you're going to pick up these headphones, you MUST download the Bose app to your phone.

I really like that you're able to change the level of noise cancellation and as always it cancels alot of background noise. I also like that you can use these without having the noise cancelling turned on. Upgraded these from the QC15's which require you to have them turned on. Battery life seems to be alright. Maybe I use mine quite a bit but it seems like they'll need to be charged around once a week. These are super comfortable. I definitely forget I have them on sometimes.

Set up for these was very difficult, both with pairing with my phone and laptop. I had to download the Bose app to connect to my phone which I felt was unnecessary. I've never had this much trouble, even when buying much cheaper brands. I deleted the app after pairing since I've read reviews about the app updating and messing up the headphones. My Biggest disappointment is that you can barely turn your head in any direction without disruptions. For comparison, I bought a generic bluetooth adapter for my QC15 pair and these barely had an issue with disruptions. You basically have to keep your head straight or the music will go in and out.

I find they do drown out a lot of noise, but aren't totally sound cancelling. I can still hear the murmurs of people talking loudly around me, faintly hear a baby screaming, and definitely heard the chimes when the lav smoke alarm went off.
They were great when I was in a noisy hotel room and didn't want to use earplugs because afraid wouldn't hear the alarm, but used them and my white noise app drowned out the weird stuttering air conditioner, the traffic outside and still heard my alarm in the morning. I thought it would be uncomfortable, but slept soundly. Then noticed after 8 hours of night use, the battery was only at 70%.
Those minimal times I do listen to music loud, I find I don't disturb others around me with sound leakage, which is great too.

Seriously.","December 10, 2018","Never did I ever think I would spend so much money on headphones. I also always previously though people looked goofy and/or pretentious with their enormous headphones. My earbuds are so sleek and convenient. Let me tell you, I was wrong.

Bought this to go on a weekend trip that required me to share a room with a large friend who snores terribly (but swears she doesn’t). Even on the plane, I knew I had made a great purchase but they blocked out the snoring probably 95%. What came through was very faint, almost like a very, very distant white noise machine (of what sound or why you’d want it, who knows). I am very sensitive to noise and a light sleeper in general so these headphones were just a remarkable experience when first turning them on.

I am not on the autism spectrum but, man, I can definitely see why individuals with certain sensitivities and degrees on that spectrum could benefit from wearing noise cancelling headphones. I feel like I’m on my own world where hardly anyone or anything can bug me. I rarely want to take them off when I get to work in the morning!

I now wear these every day on my 2.5 mi walking commute to work across DC. I listen to podcasts and the low noise cancelling feature is great for traffic bc it cancels out most of the blaring sirens, jake breaks and car horns but still allows you to hear them enough to be aware of your surroundings. You can also hear voices enough to tell if someone is talking to you or asking for directions. I just press pause to listen and then play to continue.

My only (very small) complaint is that unless you sleep on your back, they are not very comfortable to sleep with. I have pretty noisy upstairs and next door neighbors. Just a poorly constructed, small condo building with thin walls and objectively *awful* squeaky floorboards. The headphones cancel all that out but due to their bulkiness, it is uncomfortable to have them pressing against your ear/head when on your side or stomach. This is the only way I can sleep so I feel like I’m trading one thing for another in order to sleep well. Still, I’ll take this over that!

In my mind it will depend on what people want.

If you have never used a noise-cancelling headset before, you will be amazed.  When I switch them on, the mower noise just drops into the background.
A thoughtful feature is the ability to select several levels of noise-cancellation, or none.  If you want to talk with someone, pressing a button on an earcup allows you to hear normally, eliminating the need to take the headphones off.  It's a small thing, but it's the sort of extra touch that Bose is known for, and which makes their products so usable.
If you use them infrequently, you may find yourself fumbling with which button does what, but that's just a learning-curve thing.  I haven't tried the phone-answering feature yet.
As always, you get the top-quality materials and excellent build quality that will keep these headphones working and a pleasure to use for many years.  I expect that I would wear out 2-3 pairs of cheaper noise-cancelling headphones over the useful life of one Bose QC 35 II, so while Bose's purchase price is off-putting, I expect to more than recoup my investment long-term.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I tried earplugs from the pharmacy, they work great but aren't very comfortable. These headphones, while admittedly about 1,000 times more expensive are welllll worth it. With the noise cancelling setting on low I can still hear whats going on around me, people talking in the next room, or when someone is talking to me. But I don't hear the boys in the garage blasting their radios at all!

The ear plugs from the pharmacy blocked EVERYTHING, I could only hear myself breathing, which was kinda creepy, lol

They're very comfortable. Yes, I get some funny looks when people come in my office, but then they hear the background noise and understand!

I haven't tried any of the other features yet as far as taking calls, or the google assistant.

I only have to charge it about once a week. The AirPods are the most portable and convenient to use headphones I’ve ever seen. When you wear them they are practically weightless. And I don’t have to worry about them falling out. Your mileage may very on the fit. Plus being able to hear the outside world is about a plus when you are jogging or skiing. For home, office, airplane, and the like these Bose headphones will not disappoint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

It excelled in noise cancellation, but other than that.  I would say average at its very best . Sound quality might be for classical music or for audiobooks , it’s too bright ! If ur looking for listening to hip hop , rock , metal etc... search for other brands ! Bass is really mediocre ...
if you’re looking to use these at the gym , make sure they won’t hold like u expect ! They are very slippery ...
another thing I need to mention is the built in quality : for this amount of $$$ i would’ve expected stronger and better quality ...
overall , it’s an ok product . I didn’t find anything interesting other than great noise cancellation and battery life ... maybe for audiobook lovers intellects it will do the job ... but for me it’s a no no !!!

There are a couple problems though. With a lack of documentation, It was difficult to figure out how to pair with a device other than my phone (hold switch for 2 seconds), but once I figured that out, it was pretty simple. The sound produced by the headphones is definitely superior to that of my previous, $10 headphones, which should be expected, although I don't know that it's $290 more superior. There are some drawbacks, which make me give it three stars. First, the noise reduction algorithm causes a delay. If you are watching TV or a movie through them, the sound will be about a second delayed. Using the ""less noise"" reduction algorithm gets things pretty much back on track, and still works pretty darn good for noise reduction. The biggest issue I had with these headphones was how uncomfortable they are. Ears hot. Area around ears, where the pads hit, hurt. It's just not tolerable for me. I'm going to send these back (hack, Amazon now charges for shipping things back!) and try the in-ear variety. Sadly, I know noise reduction won't be as good with those.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I also have (for prior 2 years) the Samsung  Level (SL) (model EO-BN920) Bluetooth neck bracelet style ear buds.  Here are the differences.

1) Samsung Level (SL)  have a greater Bluetooth range
2) The SL is easier to answer the phone.  There are three buttons easily tactally identified to answer, volume up-down and pause.  Also the SL magnetic earbud sensing answers and hangers up / pauses content.  The Bose is hard to identify buttons especially when you install backwards.
3)The Bose negotiates BT connectivity to my devices better than SL. I am constantly reconnecting the SL  after I go out of range especially the iPhone.
4) The SL is better or more handy to wear. You can park the SL earbuds (magnetically connected)  so when the phone rings place them in your ears and your talking. The Bose are so large you are apt to place them down and are not as readily deployable.
5) The SL battery life is at least 1/3 longer than the Bose even on my 2 year olds SLs.
6) The Bose noise cancelling comes in handy when mowing or running noisy equipment. This is probably the most useful feature.
7) The SL cost 10x less.

Summary:
If I could only have one headset device I would chose the SL because it fits the majority of need. Nothing wrong with the Bose just my experience.  Hope that’s helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I use them daily, I travel with them, I never leave home without them. I used to be afraid of Bluetooth headphones because of concerns over battery life or headaches I would sometimes get from Bluetooth (true story!). That being said, these QC35s are AMAZING and I am so happy I own them.  I used to think the Bose QC20s were the absolute best, but I have since gone cordless and I don't think I can go back.

The battery life is solid - I can use these pretty almost all week without recharging them. The sound quality is solid. I'm not an audiophile but it sounds great to me. The noise canceling is fantastic and I can't really imagine flying anymore without these.

There is only ONE problem with these and the rest of the Bluetooth Bose headphones: the ability to pair with two devices simultaneously is both awesome and super annoying. I tend to pair between either my MacBook Pro and my iPhone, or my iPhone and my iPad, depending on where I am. The headphones will pair with both, but sometimes the headphones will ""listen"" to one of the devices when I want to hear audio on another, which makes me end up doing some jumble of turning off Bluetooth on one device so I can force the QC35s to listen to the device I want. For example, when I fly now, I try to remember to turn off Bluetooth on my MacBook Pro if I'm not using it and leaving it up in overhead storage, because even when asleep the Bluetooth is still on and the QC35's will pair with them, when I only want to use my iPhone or iPad to watch movies or listen to music. So in these situations, I have to load the app on my iPhone and disconnect the Mac, or pull out my MBP and turn off Bluetooth. Super annoying. Suggestion to Bose: add an extra button that lets users toggle between which Bluetooth device we want to hear. Perhaps even allow a third connection. Then, I could sit there on the plane, paired to my iPhone, iPad and MBP, and I could click a button to toggle between which device I want to hear. Problem solved and I would be super happy. USB-C charging would be great too since this is inevitable for our devices.

I'm still giving these 5 stars because despite this Bluetooth issue, they are still my favorite headphones for daily use. So, in summary, I love these, but here are my three suggestions:

1) Add a button to toggle between paired devices.
2) Increase number of allowed simultaneously paired devices to 3.
3) Switch the port to USB-C for charging since this is the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

When I received this package today, I thought I was finally going to have the chance to get some sleep. I live in a room right next to a noisy person (and rude - phone calls right next to me at 2 a.m. kind of deal), and have neighbors with yappy dogs that they leave out for hours on end at times. I've tried various ear plugs, but those haven't been effective enough for blocking the noises, so I figured I'd try active noise-cancelling headphones. These do not work for that purpose. I have the noise cancelling function set on ""high,"" but I can still hear the TV downstairs, footsteps nearby and chatting a few rooms away. It blocks has blocked out a very limited range of background road noise (noises like revving engines are still heard), but simply isn't doing what it claims to be able to do: cancel noise.

I'm desperate here - does anyone happen to have suggestions for headphones that actually cancel noise? I've been playing brown noise in the background when I try to sleep, but the constant auditory input in my life is driving me crazy and I want to be able to simply block out the noise.

I cannot live without out my Bose QC 35 II's (even considering a second one to keep at work).  It is empowering to put these on and all the noise pollution just goes away.  I bought them for home and hadn't planned on taking them to my large open floor office.  I put them on and suddenly realized there was a very low and loud humm coming from the ceiling (air blowers I assume).  Now gone.  I sit there in my cubicle and feel sorry for everyone else because they don't have a pair of these.

I tried other brands, but they were simply not properly engineered.  Once you get the pairing ""dialed in"" it is seamless.  I have a Mac and iPhone but bought the new model (with Google voice button).  I use the button's alternate function of turning on/off noise cancellation -- just for fun to remind me how great this product works.

It is hard to pass up the benefits. The comfort is great although ears do feel warm after a time. The ambient noise is greatly reduced. The sound is OK for me, but I am no audiophile.  They are big and a little clunky and I can't wear them for more than an hour without airing out my ears for a few minutes. They seal quite well around the ears and there is no air flow, I suppose to make the sound cancelling work. Oh well, tradeoffs.
I find the battery lasts all day at the very least. I don't do any telephone conversations with these as a rule but a time or two and I did receive a call while using them and it went OK. I don't use the Google or the Alexa silliness but I suppose younger folks might like that. I do like that I can control the volume very easily with the control. Also, I have no problem with connecting via Bluetooth  with my iPad and my android phone. It just works. I wish I could pair more than two devices at a time, but I can't say it's really a problem. Things stay connected, too. I've had no communication failures. The radio link is really solid. I maybe should say that I am updated to the latest firmware and had no trauma. It simply worked. I've used these on airplanes and they really cut down the noise. Sometimes I'll just wear them and turn them on and I'm not listening to anything. I'm just using the noise cancellation. Certainly better than the constant noise of the plane, especially if you fly cattle class like I do. To me, Bose is very over priced and they drop products and move on to the next newer thing so in time you end up with an orphan device. Still, they have the market pretty much to themselves with these nifty QuietComfort headphones so props to them for that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

A week later, my wife surprised me with  a pair of Bose QC 35s (forgetting that I had already purchased the Sony's).  I opened the Bose QC in order to test them, figuring I would keep the better of the two and sell the others.

The reviews I had read were pretty much even between the two.  Nothing really gave me confidence that one was better for my uses or my preferences than the other.  Now after having both, I can say that I strongly prefer and recommend the Sony over the Bose.

First and foremost - the sound out of the Sony WH1000XM3 is not only better, but you can customize it using the app.
 Tweak everything about the sound in the app.  This is, to me the biggest point because the Bose QC 35's are surprisingly lacking in bass.  I own a pair of Bose SoundSports which are great for working out, with great bass right out of the box - which is why I was so surprised that the QC would pack less of a punch than their in-ear buds.  The Sony WH1000XM3 out of the box sounds good, but the ability to customize the sound through the equalizer in the app is a huge advantage over the Bose QC 35s.

The touch controls on the Sony are great as well.  Intuitive and responsive.  The controls on the Bose are straight forward and work fine, but I do like the ability to just reach up and swipe, tap, or put my hand over the ear cup to hear the ambient sounds as opposed to finding the right button (first world problem, I know, but it is a great feature).

The noise canceling is indistinguishable to me.  Both work great.  I could not tell a difference as I switched between the two of them while watching TV, or observing the kids while arguing.  I wore the Sony for a 2.5 hour flight with no fatigue or discomfort at all.  Not sure about the Bose, but I don't think they would cause any issues or discomfort - they feel pretty much the same on the head/ears.

A couple additional small wins for Sony:
The fact that the case comes with small sectioned off areas separated by cloth for your 3.5mm jack and USB.  Bose does not have this, which means you can use the pocket on the cover (one inside and one outside) but if you use the one inside the cords are pressed into the ear cups.
Sony uses USB-C.  No guessing which side is up when plugging into the headphones to charge.
Sony comes with an Airplane jack adapter.  Even though most airlines use the single prong input now, it's nice to have, just in case.

If Bose had an equalizer, the sound could most likely be made to be equal, if not better than the Sony.  But the equalizer feature on the Sony WH1000XM3 enables me to really dial in the sound, leaving the Bose sounding flat in comparison.  That alone puts them over the top for me.  The additional features alone would not be enough for me to accept inferior quality, but I don't have to.  All it together puts Sony way out ahead in my opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I really wanted to love these - as I had wanted to when I purchased a pair of original QC35s. I love Bose speakers, esp. bluetooth speakers, and have Bose stereo systems in several cars I currently / recently owned (currently two Mercedes and one Audi), all of which are excellent systems.

These are the most comfortable headphones I've tried - which includes, for reference, Sennheiser HD1, Bang & Olufsen H9 (my personal favorite of all headphones), Bowers & Wilkins P7s, Bluedio, AudioMX, etc. etc. These ARE comfortable.

I do think these have the best noise-canceling in the industry, including the Sony MDR-1000X (or current WH-1000XM2). Much of that has to do with the softness and plushness of the ear pads; you'll notice that about 2/3 of the noise canceling is accomplished simply by WEARING the headphones, even while off.

I like the addition of the multifunction button that toggles between noise canceling high / low / off. Very good.

These are attractive. The ear cups swivel 90 degrees so you can lay them flat on your chest while around your neck. They just look nice - look like quality. The two-tone covers are a great touch and executed with precision.

Audio performance is still in the bottom 25% of all bluetooth headphones I've ever tested. And that numbers somewhere near 50 over the last several years. Here, the Bang & Olufsen just trounces the Bose. Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2 is a runner-up. Bowers & Wilkins P7 is also superb. The Bose sound performance at all volume levels is a forgettable also-ran. Even with the ANC turned off, the bass is wimpy and the mids - vocals, strings - are flaccid, underwhelming. There's no warmth, no voice, no presence. No different than the original QC35, and wholly inferior to the B&O, Plantronics, and B&W named above - by an order of magnitude. This isn't the ""Bose sound"".

And now the cardinal sin: connection quality. I tried with two phones to confirm (although both work extremely well with all other offerings mentioned above, and many more). On a clear day, the Bose QC35 has about a 15 foot range with a clear line of sight before it starts cutting out. If you put your phone in your pocket and walk outside, the music skips constantly. Unusable. Even indoors, you have to have the phone in the pocket on the same side as the bluetooth receiver - which appears to be in the LEFT ear cup - or it will also skip while your phone is in your pocket. Outdoors it doesn't matter; it skips constantly. If I didn't have a list of 60 or 70 paired devices on my phone - speakers, headphones and cars - I would say, ""maybe it's my phone"". It isn't. It's the QC35ii. Unfortunately, this is exactly the behavior I observed on the original QC35, which was also unacceptable. And, like the original QC35, I will have to return these.

If you want attractive headphones that are very comfortable and very aesthetically pleasing, and don't particularly care about the quality of the sound they're producing, these are clear winners, best in the industry. They tick off those two boxes very well. But if you want Great ANC and Great comfort, but dominant sound performance, these are not contenders in any way. Regardless of price. Check out Bang & Olufsen H9, Bowers & Wilkins P7, and Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2 for excellent comfort, three very different aesthetic options, and vastly dominant sound quality. Out of the three, the B&O is the top dog, but both of the other two are simply excellent and can't disappoint.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have a loud work environment and between my old age/hearing loss and these headphones in noise cancelling mode (even without any sound playing) I can barely hear anything in my office.

I was a little surprised at how fragile they feel/appear. I guess I was expecting something sturdier feeling, but that would probably have been much heavier.

The biggest problem is that they have noticeable audio/video lag while in bluetooth mode. It's a shame that Bose sells a $350 set of bluetooth headphones without low latency bluetooth support. This makes these headphones pretty worthless for watching tv, or watching videos on your computer without a cord.

And that audio cord? It's proprietary, for no reason. It's just a tiny bit smaller than a standard 3.5mm audio cord. This means as soon as you lose that cord, you can't plugin these headphones to anything without buying a replacement. Oh, and Bose doesn't tell you what that special cable/connector is called. And you can see from Bose's Amazon store they don't sell those cables.

Pros: Comfortable
Noise Cancelling is great

Cons: Seemingly Fragile - time will tell
Audio/Video lag is noticeably bad
Special audio cord that is difficult to replace if lost

Overall I'm disappointed with this purchase. For $350 I thought I would end up with something that works well for watching videos on my computer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

My use case is everyday office wear, light music, and using them without music to dampen office sounds. Comfort - Nice fit, without feeling like suction cups. I've worn them everyday for a couple weeks at work with no problem.  My ears sometimes get a little sore after 3+ hours of consecutive use.
Sound - These sound very good, especially at low volumes. Bose just does good speakers.
Noise Cancelling - It took me a day or two to get used to not being able to hear people come in and out of the office! Naturally, the class of sounds that are most easily cancelled are droning noises, so distant conversations, the sounds of people walking down hallways, and air vents are all gone. Two types of sounds do still come through: The first, is that I use a mechanical keyboard, so the sharp click of my keys pierces through. The next, is that deeper voices have a little bit more difficultly being filtered.

Overall, this noise cancelling is great, and I often use the headphones for this without music. It was between this pair and the Sony WH1000XM2. I went with the Bose for a couple reasons: My love of the last pair their headphones I owned (they sounded so good) vs. the current Sony headphones I have of the same type, the reviews stating the Sony NC headphones are uncomfortable and a little hot sometimes, and that the Sony pair requires you to have something actively playing for noise cancelling to be on.

So far, I've been very satisfied with this purchase, and I believe its increased my productivity by isolating me a little bit from my environment. The one thing I would make a little better is comfort into hour 4. I highly recommend these headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

During the summer, I usually have an AC unit or a fan going in my office, so I wanted great noise cancellation, and these definitely deliver;; I can hardly hear any ambient noise when they're on.  They are very comfortable to wear too.  For the price, I wasn't real happy with the sound quality from the internal mic though.  It's not bad, but it's not great.  I'm not sure if it's a wired vs. Bluetooth connection thing (I've generally heard that wired connections produce better mic sound quality).  I bought these mainly to use for work, and I spend a couple hours on the phone everyday.  I did some audio tests between its internal mic and my wired Apple Earpods, and I honestly think the mic in my wired Earpods sounds a little better.  I researched headset-type boom mics and found good reviews for the V-Moda BoomPro mic.  The Quietcomfort 35 ii has a 2.5mm audio port (the user manual incorrectly says 3.5 mm), and the BoomPro mic has a 3.5mm jack.  I found a 2.5mm male by 3.5mm female adapter from SFCable, and it works great to connect the two.  I much prefer the sound quality from the BoomPro mic over the internal headset mic, but for most folks, I think you'll be OK with the internal mic. Overall, I am happy with these headphones, and I really like them paired with the V-Moda BoomPro mic for phone calls.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The other reason was that these headphones were not able to decode audio for Skype on Android.

Since my original review, Bose has added the option to switch between noise cancellation settings using the press of the action button.  If you don't mind replacing the virtual assistant function on the action button with the noise cancellation setting function then it only takes a couple clicks of the button to turn the active noise cancellation off when you turn the headset on and put it over your ears.  I would have preferred if this setting could be remembered by the device when it was turned on, but this is close enough not to be too inconveniencing.

To be clear, some users may not be bothered by the active noise cancelling.  My ears are pretty sensitive (I think?) and well-trained as I do some music production as a hobby - so to me it feels like I am 20ft underwater when the active noise cancelling is enabled.  A few other people I know who are not audiophiles have also noticed this.  Some reviewers have not.  Try them and find out for yourself!

As for decoding/encoding Skype audio on android - I am not sure if this issue still remains as I have simply been using an iPad when I need to use this headset for Skype calls.

So I will give this headset 4 stars, because of the other great features which do work as advertised:

1) The headset is extremely light and comfortable.  You will forget you are wearing it.
2) The sound quality is great considering that these are wireless.
3) Battery life is outstanding.  I've used these for 4-6 hours a day about five days in a row without having to recharge.
4) They have not fallen apart on me - the carrying case does a great job of protecting the headset during transport.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Noise cancelling is top notch. Period. The good stuff is this. But...it is waaaaaaayyy overpriced considering the sound quality, unless you like tons of bass and a kind of ""unreal sound"". There is not such a great definition in the sound. Then: build quality is good but again, it is all light plastic and fancy soft material that is wearing very fast even if, because of the price, you'll probably take good care of it. And again: the noise cancelling is especially useful during trips on trains and airplanes (and I bet most people will use it in this situations), where you have a lot of other noises coming from everywhere (because noise cancelling works, but non totally), so the sound quality does really matter? Probably not, and nobody can say the sound quality is good in this kind of environments...
And if you travel on a not brand new plane you'll probably have to deal with the odd dual-jack connector, and guess what? The adaptor IT IS NOT PROVIDED with this headset (well...you pay 350$...you cannot pretend to have a small piece of plastic in such a premium product... isn't it?); I got a great deal the day a travelled with my wife and I had to give her my 10¢ adaptor so she could enjoy the entertainment on our 12 hrs flight!!!
Last but not the least: you'll probably look very fashionable on a plane with this headphones, but you still have to carry them in a case that is quite big, cause over-ear headphones are big, even if foldable. So consider this.
Ah, the charge connector is a mini-usb, sooooo old style, not even a lighting nor USB-C...beware apple fans, you'll need another charging cable! And Bluetooth is not even v5, but the old crappy v4, so good luck with the connection stability and the delay.
Compared to my cheap wired Taotronics made in China (like the Bose) that I payed 40$ and they are small, feather light, in ear (the most comfortable I ever had in my life), with an airplane adaptor, a super good noise reduction and a astonishing good balanced sound for the price, this Bose are a totally nonsense.

I swear by noise canceling headphones but wanted wireless. These Bose headphones are amazingly comfortable to wear. Sound quality if excellent, just what I've come to expect from Bose.
It's so freeing not to be tied by a cable to the device playing your audio or video.

Setting them up was seamless, with one important caveat: you have to download a Bose Connect app on -each- device you want to connect to it. This means, you MUST set up each device -before- you get on the plane. (Learned this the hard way.)
Once set up and you turn them on, a quiet voice says, ""Connected with X's iPhone, connected with X's iPad."" Yes, it can connect to both devices at once; no need to switch back and forth. I'm very impressed by this.
Buttons on the headphones give you control of the volume and between high or low levels of noise cancellation, or none at all.
Another big benefit: these are rechargeable. I don't have to take extra batteries with me when I travel. The headphones and accompanying connector cords all fit in one nice carrying case.

They even include a cable so you could use the headphones with a cord to plug it into a device. (Valuable when I didn't get my iPad set up before getting on the plane.) However, they left one important detail undisclosed; the plugs on this cable are not identical at both ends and the difference is easy to overlook One is 3.5 mm: this one goes into your device. The other end is 2.5 mm: this one goes into the headphone. Be sure to plug the smaller end into the headphones very snugly. It doesn't go all the way in at first attempt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Apparently the clipping issue is a common one for these headphones-- seems like Bose's firmware caters more to Apple brands, so if you use iPhones and such clipping may not be an issue.

Constant bluetooth connectivity issues.","September 3, 2018","I was excited to get this pair of headphones but after a couple of months of use I am compelled to come back here and write some feedback. I am very disappointed for the reasons listed below.

- constant, and I a mean constant issues with bluetooth connectivity when switching devices. Once you connect you're generally OK, but switching devices often requires multiple retries. For comparison I never have this issue with my Sony HDR. The most frequent issue is the bluetooth connecting to a device after turning the headphones on, only to immediately disconnect.
- intermittent interruptions in music playback (very brief, in the millisecond range). They seem to happen every 30-40minutes to 1-2 hrs. Frankly these interruptions are a minor annoyance, but for headphones from Bose they are unacceptable.
- Stuttering, continuously interrupted sound play when connected to two devices at the same time. This does not occur all the time, it seems to happen when I am connected to a chromebook AND my iMac at the same time. The only way I have found to address this is by disconnecting one of the devices and reconnecting the headphones to the other (turning one of the devices off is not enough, once the stuttering kicks in, you have to restart the headphones and reconnect).

UPDATE: 01/04/19 - bose pushed a few updates to their firmware, but it has not helped at all with regards to the bluetooth connectivity issues. Basically if you have multiple devices (say your phone and then switching between a work and home computer) expect constant issues, with the headphones connecting and disconnecting to the computers all the time. In addition recently (last couple of months) a new issue has come up, where the headphones would be connected the laptop, but would NOT play any sound (even though the laptop sees them as connected and the headphones themselves say they are connected). The solution seems to be turn up the volume to the max, and to press play/stop/play on the laptop to get the headphones to start playing sound. I don't quite get what the deal is with trying to make it possible for the headphones to connect to multiple devices, but in any case BOSE completely screwed up the work flow there.

The stuttering has been fixed by one of the firmwares as I no longer get any stuttering.
END UPDATE.

All in all this is massive disappointment.

So long story short, while I love the look and design of the headphones (very comfortable) and while I love the sound and the noise cancellation (after you get the bluetooth working), they are way too glitchy and require way too much fiddling. I regret that I am no longer able to return this as I've had them for a couple of months already.

I am simply very very disappointed. It seems to be that this pair of headphones is unnecessarily complicated, and Bose never worked out all the details in the many features they tried to cram into it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

1. Ear hurts with noise cancellation.
Literally, noise cancellation annoyingly hurts ears - like you're in airplane. Not just feeling muffled, but pressure cause pain. This gets a bit alleviated when music plays, but eventually so much fatigue to your ear. No no no.

2. Ear pads / housing doesn't rotate 90 degrees.
Depends on which direction. When I want to remove the headphone from my ears and just put around my neck, I want the ear pads to turn 90 degrees so that they touch my chest 100%, because the ear pads are too bulky - feels like a huge muffler around your neck. But it just rotates about 80 degrees or so. It does rotate 90 degrees the other way, e.g. ear pad facing outwards from your chest. But then the caps gets scratched by zippers or other metal parts on my jacket.

3. Awful phone call quality
Noise cancellation on mic just cancels background noise, not the voice frequency components. Otherwise, my voice will be cancelled as well. But that eventually ends up other vocal noise from nearby ppl, etc. are well heard by the other party. This is terrible for conference calls or phone calls.

Don't buy this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

not sire if mine is defective. sometimes there will be sharp noise bursting out in the middle when signal isn’t stable and you have to turn it off and on to stop the noise . Not a huge problem comparing its good sound quality but still annoying when it happens.

Update after continuous using of a couple weeks.
Still love it. The quality is good. Battery charging speed improves if you use high speed cable and plug.

The headphone somehow getting loose.. if I lay down or look down by tilting my head, it will fall. It also tangled hair easily, esp if you have long hair, when taking off.

Noise canceling is amazing.
Very comfortable.
Useful App and micro adjustable sound volume.

The only complaint would be the battery... I've charged for two days and it's never full.. not sure if it's broken.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have been wearing them for about a week and am happy with the results.

When I am in the office, the noise cancellation at max level does a nice job of silencing almost everything. I can still hear voices but they are drastically muted. The building HVAC sounds completely disappear and I’ve been startled by a co-worker a few times because I didn’t hear them approach my desk when my back was turned.

I work from home twice a week and have been able to completely tune out my husband who plays video games and chats with his friends rather loudly (he plays in the basement under my office). He also snuck up on me when I was wearing them and scared the crap out of me 😆

The sound quality is good - I’ve had multiple conference calls and have experienced no issues. Most of the time, I wear them (without any audio) simply to block out background noise. Seems kind of silly to spend so much money for that sole reason but they really do an excellent job at noise cancellation.

I recommend purchasing the extended warranty - I had issues with Bose earbuds a few years ago so I don’t completely trust the lasting quality of their products.

The only minor thing I don’t care for is the light colored headband cushion and fabric material. I considered this before purchasing the rose gold color and obviously, it wasn't enough of a deterrent for me to choose the black model. It is a comfortable band but I can see it getting dirty quickly. Especially for people who dye their hair (I dye my hair black).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

There is no guessing when you use these headphones, voice whispers in your ear the charge level and which of your Bluetooth devices are connected.

The Series II has some neat extras that are not in the Series I, a Google button is the most useful. When you first turn them on you will be instructed to download the Bose+ app, you can move on without it but you really do want it. It allows you to give the headphones a name and other fun things that make your listening experience that much more enjoyable. I think I'm going to secretly swap his for my older (2 years) set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0756CYWWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
