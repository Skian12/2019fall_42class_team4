I have a long commute every day, and these are great for any phone calls I have to make.  The clarity is great, and everyone, including my hard of hearing dad, hears just fine.  I love these for working out.  I either listen to music or an audiobook and I just go.  I work at a place where I need to be aware of my environment such as phone calls and customers coming into the store, and these help my workday go by much faster but I'm still able to perform at a high level and finish the day strong because of my increased happiness from the music!  I also love the ability to access siri through these things.  When you hold down the main button the headphones say ""voice dial"", but in essence you've accessed Siri or whatever you have on your device.  You can then tell your phone to do whatever you need just like you regularly do.
Love this device, and I can't wait to see any new product releases in the future!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Considering that these have worked surprisingly well! If I had to discribe the sound quality it's subpar unless you are using ear plugs. With these being bone conduction they work a lot better and sound 100x better while wearing ear plugs.  There is a downside to that though since this causes added pressure which causes some irritation.

The size honestly for me seemed perfect but they also looked a little small to me so I was surprised with how well they fit.

Not sure why people are complaining about noise cancelation as there is no genuine way for these to do so unless you count the ear plugs they came with as noise cancelation.

 As an over all I thought these headphones were great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I run and strength train and enjoy listening to music w ear buds. There are times when i have taken out one bud to listen to  outdoor sounds and my breathing when running so i thought it would be nice to have headphones that gave me both. Upon receiving these I was not expecting much but, I did like the sound they produced considering their structure. Beware, if ur expecting the in ear, bud noise cancelling sound, u will be disappointed. These are what they say they are, the ability to hear some music and answer calls while also hearing noises around you.
For this they do deliver.
There are a pair of foam ear plugs included, you can plug your ears and this amplify the sound slightly by cancelling some of the outside noise.
You can push the multi-function button twice to play the next song, but you are not able to replay the previous song, which i found to be a Miss. I really enjoy replaying my favs, over and over and find the lack of this function to be a  deal breaker. Also, as another reviewer stated, the arms around the back of the neck are long and hang down, having adjustable arms would've been a nice feature.

UPDATE: The non-adjustable arms and a key feature,FOR ME, the inability to reply a previous song was enough to return this item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Yes, when I'm on a busy road I have a hard time hearing the music/podcast, but at least I feel safer. I usually have an issue with earbuds or headphones in that after I've worn them for a bit (30 min or more) I'll start to get uncomfortable.

I am an avid mountain biker so I needed something that had good sound, stayed in place and still allowed me to have situational awareness ( mountain lions, bears, and rattle snakes  oh my!!)  I'll give my review by addressing other peoples concerns.

Some people don't like that they move around on your head.  It is true that as you move your head, they do pivot at the speakers.  This took me a few days to get used to but I don't even notice anymore.  The speaker part stays in place in front of your ear while the back moves up and down as your head moves.  While mountain biking they pivot as needed but stay firmly on my head.

Some people have said the sound quality isn't great.  This is true if you are an audiophile with $20k worth of high end sound equipment at home.  For us normal people, the sound quality is very good.  I can clearly hear the music even when I am shooting down a steep rock garden, adrenaline pumping, praying I don't crash.

Other pro's:
- Battery life is good
- Very comfortable
- They fit well while I am wearing my bike helmet and safety glasses.

Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.  I understand that these types of headphones are not for everyone, but for me and my active lifestyle, they have been outstanding, and if you can accept a new normal when wearing headphones, I think you will love (or at least like) them too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

1. Earpieces don't stay in my ear so this obviously bypasses that problem
2. For ridding, the open ear nature of these headphones is great because I can still take input from the outside world for safety
3. For running, my ears can ""breath"" and it's a much more comfortable feeling

What they are not good at is:
1. Canceling noise, if your environment is noisy, in my experience I have difficulty hearing the music (includes air rushing by your ears when ridding)
2. Sound quality is mediocre
3. When the volume is turned up high, it vibrates against my bones which is uncomfortable.

That means that the functions of the 3 buttons change depending on what you're doing (i.e. listening to music, taking a call, etc.).  However, it's not very good at telling what's going on.

For example, the microphone mute is activated by pressing the + and - buttons at the same time.  But if your headphones decide that you are listening to music instead of in a call, it won't mute.

Also, the microphone un-mutes itself after about 30 seconds for no apparent reason.  I can't find out why that is from manuals or FAQ's.  One of the main reasons I picked this particular headset is that it seemed to have good in-call controls.  But it doesn't.

Wife can finally yell for me (and I can hear her) when I am working out.","June 12, 2019","For riding a bike outside, I agree the wind can cause sound issues. However, if you position the headset right, you can get good sound while riding. Not good with lawn equipment, period. The sound quality is good when you put them on a spot near your ear opening.

These headphones are great for normal wearing around the house, backyard, etc. My biggest peeve with other headphone & earbuds was the sweat pooling in my ear when I worked out. AfterShokz hasn't given me that issue.

The other reviews citing odd vibrations at high volumes are accurate. Don't turn them up that far & there is no problem.

I can still hear everything around me when the volume is lower. When it's at mid-level, it's nearly the same as having one earphone in and the other not.

*Fun Tidbit* - Stick the headphones on the rear sides of your head. That's a neat experience. You really can hear the music that far from your ears. I did that tonight, June 13, 2019, just playing around with them. Volume was mid-level when I did it.

Oh, the reflectors are a neat addition. Haven't put them on anything yet.

Two majorly annoying things: it pinches around the top of my ears no matter how I position it, and the band is far too large for my head. I don't have a particularly small head, either. Most hats I HAVE to get adjustable, and then it's adjusted almost the biggest it can get, and with this band, it's still too big. I can put my entire hand underneath the band and the back of my head. While I'm sure having it a little loose allows for movement (and hair), having it this loose on me, means if I look upwards, even a little bit, the band hits the top of my shoulders/base of my neck and gets pushed slightly out of position. If the band were shorter, it would be further up my neck and not have this problem. 😩 I'm afraid these may get inherited by my son and I go back to the drawing board for lightweight and space-saving headphones that I don't have to stick in my ear canal. (I have chronic eczema in my ears). You also cannot wear sunglasses or eyeglasses with these. They compete for space above your ear and quickly become uncomfortable. I have figured out the most comfortable way to wear these for me is to wear a very low, loose ponytail and let the band sit just above it, resting on my ponytail. That's they only way I can wear them without hurting my ears after a while.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Raum","Excellent product, fantastic support and service","September 17, 2019","I've owned three of these over the last ~four years. I use them in a lab where for safety reasons you can't use headphones. When you use earplugs in conjunction with the headphones you get the same noise isolation that you get with silicone ear buds and the quality of sound is comparable with typical ear buds. With out earplugs you loose some fidelity, but have the benefit of hearing your environment much better.

I've had to return headsets twice. Once because the speakers in the headset started to vibrate and distort sound; and the current set because my lab decided to irrationally cut down on all manner of anything involved with sound and your ears - regardless of the situational awareness maintenance that the bone conduction headphones allow. In both cases AfterShokz was extremely responsive and handled both the malfunctioning headset and return headset quickly and fairly.

The only reason I didn't give these headphones 5 stars is the lack of bass.  Not a deal breaker for me but would have been nice.

Now for the good stuff!  I was skeptical at first because I've never tried bone conduction headphones before but these are super-comfortable and sound quality is nice and crisp.  Great for audiobooks.  I bought these primarily to wear at the gym so when I put them to the test I was impressed...even during strenuous weight lifting and lot of sweating they stayed securely fitted.  Also my gym has horrible ""mainstream"" music (if you can even call it music) blasting across the whole place and I was afraid with these headphones being off-ear that might be a problem but thankfully I couldn't hear it hardly at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They rest behind The ears. I think they are applying too much downward pressure. I fix this problem by placing them over the arms of my safety glasses at work. That seems to give some relief for a couple of hours. The microphone is ok...it's good if you need to take a call hands-free and you aren't worried about the quality. I find I have to turn up the volume on my phone a bit to understand the person on the other end, then the headphones vibrate like crazy, distorting the caller's voice. It feels very weird to have my face vibrating! The microphone makes it sound like I'm in a tin can, but it works. I give an over-all rating of 4 stars because of the heaviness upon my ears. I love love love the ability to listen to my favorite music at work and still be able to interact with the world around me. That is too cool. The sound is nice.

The problem is that sometimes the music and sounds skips around a bit by bit. It’s not quite clear when using the microphone, been told couple of times that they couldn’t hear me through the microphone.

Too bad this product only useable for 6hrs. Would’ve been better if it was 10 to 12 hrs like the power beats.

UPDATE: I bought this product on January and the arm part snaps in November. Also the bluetooth lags a lot. The music skips a bit and sometimes it’s difficult to talk through the mic.

I'm really glad that I did. I've been on two runs so far, and I'm amazed how well these things work. The sound is more than good enough for jogging. I am able to clearly hear my music with the volume at less than maximum, and I can also hear what's going on in my surroundings well enough. I'm generally aware when cars are nearby, and can hear if someone speaks loudly to me. As others have said, these are not the right headphones if you are looking for perfect audio quality and deep bass. They are made for those who need good sound quality and environment awareness.

The fit is fantastic. They are comfortable and don't move or bounce at all while I am jogging. I have worn them while jogging with sunglasses and it wasn't a problem at all.

The controls work well and seem sturdy. They use a standard micro USB charging port, which is easy enough to use and seems securely attached.

I use mine with a Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music smart watch, which allows me to download music to my watch and play music on the Aftershokz. It's the perfect combination for running at a very reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sound quality is fine. It’s not great, but if you want great sound, you’re going to buy Bose or Beats or something along those lines.

These are great headphones for people who want open ears, ease of use, and lengthy battery life. I wear these things all day sometimes and only once have I ever even approached the battery limit. You can listen to music or podcasts on a run without the danger of isolating yourself from the world around you.

Drawbacks: they take some working to use while wearing hats of any kind. Probably going to be even harder to use in bitterly cold weather when I want to cover my whole head. Ditto for reclining in a chair and resting your head while listening to music. They just don’t fit on your head for that sort of thing.

I am able to hear outside noises and listen to music which is very important while road biking around traffic. When I first got them I decided to test out the battery life after full charge. They lasted for about 9 1/2 hours of just playing music, so that was a major plus. Good quality sound for everyday music play as well as using the phone.

I only have 2 issues with this headset. One would be the neck piece which is a bit long, wish they made it adjustable, or buy the mini version. With the neck piece being as long as it is, when you lay down, rest your head or look up, in my case cycling, it tends to move around the front of your ears, which in turn changes the sound of music but still not a deal breaker.  My next issues would be that after long periods of music listening, around about 5 to 6 hours, they tend to start aching the front of your ears, but I figure any headset, in ear or out, is gonna start aching after very long periods with no breaks.

Overall, good quality sound with a long battery life.  Great for doing activities in which you still need to hear what is going on outside. Would recommend these for sports enthusiast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've never been in a situation where I've run out of battery, though I charge it after most uses. For the most part I wear them while doing chores or working out so I like that I can still hear around me if someone is trying to speak to me. I also greatly enjoy that these can be completely noise cancelling when pared with ear plugs (perfect when flying to block out the noise of the plane and other passengers).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The portion that attaches the speaker to the rest of the device is a thin plastic which can snap off.  I was disappointed that mine broke, BUT since I like the device so much a purchased another.  They warranty it for 2 years, so it's well worth the money.  The only other down side is that you may need soft ear plugs to eliminate ambient noise, especially at the gym.

I liked that they did not block my hearing as I need to listen for the phone but work better with music playing.  My office is more open plan so I didn't want to disturb others with my music and this concept was perfect.  WRONG! They don't fit.  They are HUGE!  There is no way to adjust the band to you are stuck with this ""universal"" size the arbitrarily chose.  There is at least 2"" between the band and my neck.  You cannot wear these with glasses.  I know there are people excited about being able to wear them with glasses.  Yeah no, not happening.  The plastic par that sits near the ear is so thick that my glasses are pushed forward and now cause headaches.
This company either needs to come up with multiple sizes or a way to adjust the band.  I will be returning them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Do they have perfect sound fidelity and awesome bass and sweet treble? No. The sound quality is decent, but not audiophile. But you don’t want audiophile when you’re running outside. You want music and the ability to hear what’s coming behind you. At the same time. That’s what these get you.

For the rest of us these are excellent.
I use them with the Sleepo app.(A rain/white noise gen. Free btw.) to block out room noise so I can sleep. I get 10 Hrs of playing time and they have some charge left. They do shift some but not enough to matter. Add ear plugs and you are set.
  The sound is good enough that I will end up buying a second set to wear during the day. I like that you can turn them down and hear the sounds around you unlike regular ear buds.

During calls these pick up all the background noise and to the listener you will sound muffled and distant.  These were promoted at the Loves to truck drivers, ABSOLUTELY NOT, my wife couldn't hear me over the truck.

As far as sound, again, very disappointing.  The sound is muffled, and the bass throbs against your bone and feels awkward.  The titanium model also after 15 minutes of use starts to really push against your temple area and becomes very uncomfortable

I hate wires. I hate Bluetooth. I hate in the ear plugs that fall out, don't fit, get nasty, get sweaty. I don't want some pod thing that I'm going to lose when I put it down, or it falls out. This headset solved all my problems. I don't care about some fanciful explanation on how they work, I just appreciate that they do. They're rigid but flexible, so you can manuever them or fit them however you want and you're barely aware of their presence. You can run climb jump, do whatever you want and they don't fall off. It doesn't blast directly into your ear drum, but their still loud enough for me to enjoy when I cut the grass or take the motorcycle out. Battery life is great and they've had quiet a few recharges at this point. Haven't had them die on me yet, which would make me want to throw them in a river. Bluetooth has never been a problem, they connect instantly and STAY connected.

All in all, worth my time and trouble to put thoughts into the review. I appreciate a company that makes a well thought out product.

3. When they are at 30% they will disconnect from my phone. That's a 1/3 of the battery life remaining.

That's how poor the audio quality is. I did a lot of research on bone conduction headphones, and I decided that these ones would best suit my needs. I could not have been more mistaken, and I truly regret purchasing this product. I will be returning it as soon as possible

While the product looks impressive, and while your phone is in your hand the connection is fantastic, once you put it in a pocket, that's when the problems begin... That's when this product truly sucks. Imagine you're driving your car down a back country road 250 miles from the nearest radio station, that's the audio quality that you get with these headphones. Want to listen to a song? Good Luck! Cuz that song is going to come in choppy, and you'll be lucky if you hear more than 50% of it. I have $20 JVC headphones that I swapped out for these ones that work infinitely better, and every other Bluetooth headphones I have at home are clearly more connected than these ones are.

I am absolutely shocked at how crappy the quality is, for the amount of money you're being charged, you would expect near 100%, crystal-clear audio connection between your phone and the headphones. Not the case here. And before you think  ""well maybe you're running an old crappy phone?"" Rest assured that is not the case. If I was, maybe, just maybe that would explain it, but Samsung Galaxy S 9? No, there is no reason for the audio to drop out as much as it does. The phone is literally less than two feet from my headphones in a back pocket, you cannot tell me that there is any sort of interference that should be in the way there, none at all. It's just a poorly designed, poorly built product. I am really disappointed with how bad these headphones have performed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However, while the sound is pretty good when these are properly placed, I really struggle to wear them even walking and for sure running. They either hang down on my neck in a very uncomfortable way and then shift around as I run (either too close to my ear where they vibrate like crazy) or too far away where the sound isn't great OR they sit above my pony tail which displaces where they sit too much.

The fit is one-size fits most, so if you have a smaller head, it's going to be a bit wonky.  It tugs a bit on the resting place if I look up.  Otherwise, it's good to go.  A co-worker also has these, and has a smaller head, but wears them higher up on the crown of his head, not behind the ears.

I really like that I can hear ambient noise and still hear my music.

My only real issues with these are:
1.) They do put some pressure on the outer ear (to keep them on your head) so I have to limit use to around an hour.
2.) There is a very fine line between hearing your music and getting a buzzy sound on your skin. I never expected any kind of ""bass"" in these, but when I turn the audio up to hear a bit better, the drivers actually setup vibrations in my skin. I assume this is part of the bone conduction (and unavoidable), but it's good to know before purchasing.

Simpson","Better than expected, and just right for my job","November 12, 2018","I spent about a month researching headphones online. My job allows headphones, but realizing I am also getting older and a little more hard of hearing with every second, I needed something that allowed my ears not to be blocked - in case my coworkers needed my attention. The AfterShokz Trekz fit the bill nicely and have been a great addition to my daily work routine. They connected to my phone (iPhone 7) in about 3 seconds after following the directions, and have worked flawlessly my first day of using them. As they are not intended to block out everything except what I am listening to, but rather allowing me to monitor what is going on around me, they work perfectly for having background musing going. If you are looking for something to block out the noise, I would hesitate in recommending them as there are many more options for that kind of listening experience. I also ordered the recommended Hermitshell Hard Case - and I would highly recommend purchasing it as well. It carries the headphones, charging cord, and a USB wall charger very well.

As far as battery life, I have listened to music for over 7 hours today and have yet to use half the charge. Much longer than advertised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I used the sizing guide offered by the manufacturer that indicated I needed the ""normal"" size.  I was WELL into the normal range and ordered it rather than the mini-size.  I am still not certain I made the right decision as these as there is a half inch between the back of them and my head so they go down until they ""lock"" in (there is still a gap).  As I had ordered a case at the same time I have already ditched the packaging.  I also wear glasses which makes a difference in how they fit.  I'm not certain they fit right, I'm not certain they don't.  Its the not knowing that is probably annoying as I have run with them and they are comfortable enough I guess?

They work like they claim.... well the function as they claim.  I don't know about the science behind them but I can have music playing and hold a normal conversation without the music interfering but when there is no conversation hear the music well.  Which is what I wanted.

Some adjust-ability would be an asset.  I'm giving them four stars - room for improvement but they work better than expected.  Ok the more I think about this the more the fit issue is an annoyance.  If three star is ""this does what it says it does"" then this gets one knocked off from that point for the fit issue.  I have tried for several runs now and while they fit ( think) they annoy me in that they bounce downward until they are resting pretty low on my neck - might be an issue with glasses but I do put this on then slide my glasses over them (not exactly comfortable but how it is suggested)","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But what I didn't know, was that if you didn't plug your ears with earplugs or something along those lines, you'd have to turn the volume up so high that the speakers would be vibrating on your head, just hear them decently.

With earplugs in, the sound quality is just north of good. You won't get to hear all the details you may be used to with other earphones of the same price, but they do afford you better hearing health by not assaulting your eardrums for a length of time.

Unless you want to shut out the rest of the world while keeping your eardrums intact, these are the headphones you've been looking for. Otherwise, go with some earbuds that give you the high aural quality you know you deserve.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have a pair of Bluetooth in ear headphones that would loosen in my ear on longer runs due to sweat, even though they had the wings in the design.  If placed too far in my ear for a more snug fit, I would feel/hear the thump of my foot strike.  Also, when turning to look for traffic, the wire connecting the two buds would stick to my neck and pull on that side.  The Aftershokz design looked like it would solve all of these issues.  When I first connected them to my Apple Watch (which was a breeze) and wore them around the house, the sound was good but a bit thin on a couple songs.  I then rang with them the next day.  I had volume a little over half way, and it was on par with my in ear buds at a similar volume.  They were a tad bit uncomfortable at first on one side of my head.  However, after the first mile or two, my head adapted, and the discomfort faded.  I loved that they did not move on my temples at all.  The band around my head remained in place and didn’t touch my neck.  The sound was good and better on some songs than others.  I didn’t change the equalizer settings before the first run, which may help on the next run.  It was weird, as some others have noted, to hear the music AND the ambient sounds during the run.  I heard birds chirping and cars approaching, while Foo Fighters, Nirvana, STP, Gwen Stephani, and Big and Rich belted our tunes.  Very cool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But if you like to listen to music while at the gym and want ""A wall of sound"" wellllllllll....no.
Here is how it works...it turns your head into a resonator and bypasses your ear drums and injects music / sound into your inner ear. very cool tech.....BUT...that means your ear drums are still working....so that means two signals are hitting your brain at once...one from your ear drum and one via this machine. and that means which ever is louder wins! and if you are at the gym that means the gym wins. if you are at home / quiet office and it's quiet this device wins.
Pros:
1 it's really cool tech and well when it comes to ear hygiene it's the best because nothing goes into your ear!
2 everyone wants to try it out!
3 if you have any eardrum damage this will allow you to hear music better

cons
1 if you are in a room where the sound is higher than what this machine can produce the room wins!
2 the fit is so so
3 sound quality if so so

the future....
this little device could in theory give you augmented hearing / reality much like the google headset but for your ears so there is hope for the future .

-They're comfortable, even for extended periods of time.
-They're very light and don't bounce around on your head when you move, so they're great for running.
-They don't cover your ears, so you can still hear your surroundings while you listen (This might be a con for some people)
-They connect via bluetooth, so there are no annoying chords to deal with.

Cons
-I noticed a dissapointing lack of bass when compared to the $10 Panasonic earbuds I've been using.
-They aren't adjustable, so they may be uncomfortable to people with different head/ear sizes/shapes.

I can't speak to the durability of this product as I haven't had it for very long. However, I will return to this review if/when they wear out.

However, I can tell that the sound is much richer when I hold the headset closer to my head so that the bone conduction will work better. I almost returned these. Then I compared to another pair wireless buds and decided the fit and convenience are worth the slight degradation in sound quality. And those talking to me say that my voice is just fine.

Cohen","Pain in the neck...quite literally","January 4, 2019","I initially liked this headset, and in some way still do. But it's downsides are considerable.

First, the highest level of volume gets drowned out by regular street traffic unless I use my fingers to keep the ""earphones"" pressed to my head.

Second, at max volume, I can feel the device throbbing and vibrating against my jawbone - not good.

Third, the device stopped connecting to my phone a few days ago, after only using it for about 3 months.

Fourth, and hopefully last, since i started using the headset, I developed a crick in my neck and strange tingly and pulsing sensations in my left arm, above and below my elbow. Sometimes it would shoot down to my fingers. I actually didn't see the connection of the device and these physical sensations until the device stopped working and the tingling started to diminish. Two rounds of acupuncture resolved the neck pain, but I continue to get the tingling and shooting pain (which I initially thought was a precursor to a heart attack), but less and less now that I no longer use it.

In summary, the device is a nice idea, but still needs more research and development before it's a healthy and reliable device.

And I have a fifth, Amazon won't let me return it.  So I'm stuck with a $100 headset that no longer works and caused me physical pain.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Since your ears stay open it's like turning music on in the room that no one else can hear instead of isolating you in your head.
He likes that they work even when he puts in his earplugs - he works with loud equipment. In fact you can usually hear it better with ear plugs. They fit under his hard hat. With winter started he has noticed  they aren't ideal with all his winter gear on because as the gear shifts it shifts the earphones from their optimal position. Aside from that they don't budge with normal activities.
Planning on getting a set for my mom who cleans houses and needs to be able to hear clients of they want to speak to her andy father in-law likes them because he can hear them well - he's a bit hard of hearing.

My biggest negative to this product is that in order to give good audio it puts a lot of firm pressure on the temple area, giving me frequent headaches.

Update 09/2019:  After frequent use, the pressure has become non-existent or I've been used to the it that it doesn't affect me anymore.

You're NOT buying these for sound quality. Because they rely on bone conduction, they let you hear your music AND the traffic around you. They're also waterproof enough to survive 5yrs of S FL rains and don't let beach sand into the speaker outputs.

This is my 2nd pair in 5yrs. Still don't know what happened to the orig pair but first the antenna started failing and then the whole device died (entropy FTL). That being said, they DID survive 5yrs of S Florida rain and 3-4days/wk of abuse. Are they cheap? No but I more than got my $ out of the first pair so yeah, I ordered a 2nd.

A friend recommended these and I am pretty happy with them.

Others have posted photos of how they rest on your head/in front of your ears, so I'll spare you that explanation.  Typically, I'm wearing these with both sunglasses and a bike helmet and these go on the last and I then adjust the sunglasses to fit comfortably with these.

The buttons on the device are great.  I am able to adjust the volume with my right hand and pause whatever I am listening to by tapping the button on the left earpiece.

A word on the volume controls: When you first start out, make sure to adjust the volume high and then lower it to your preference. When I first put these on I was disappointed at how quiet they were until I realized I could increase the volume on these headphones independently of the volume control on my phone.  Ultimately I am happy with the volume these can achieve.

This is not a product for audiophiles. If you are focused on achieving perfect sound quality, this is not the item for you. This item is for people who would like to be able to listen while also being able to clearly hear things around them in their environment.

Battery life is approximately 4 hours. I had these running continually on a 5 hour ride yesterday and they stopped around the 3.5 hour mark and that was with a little bit of use the day prior, so I can reliably say they'll last 4 to 4.5 hours.  When the battery gets low every 5 minutes or so it pause your music and say ""charge me"" until it shuts off around 30 minutes later.

Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.  I do recommend these.  I almost never write legitimate reviews but these were worth it to me and I'm sure the similar models are likewise worthwhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was hoping for the ability to listen to music while still having the safety of hearing cars.  They work, but I can't really say they are any safer than any other headphones, and they are not super comfortable.

Bone Conducting - It works, you can test this by plugging your ear canals.  You can still hear the music, but super quiet.  To hear at any great volume you have to turn the volume way up.  And that is the problem.  Most of the sound you hear when wearing these is sound coming in through your ear canal.  So there is little different between these and other over the ear headphones that don't have noise isolation.  When riding on a busy road, I have to crank the music up way loud to hear it, but this starts to impede on my ability to hear traffic.  THEY JUST DON'T LIVE UP TO THE HYPE ABOUT SAFETY.

Comfort - They are not nearly as comfortable as other headphones, I don't think anyone can argue otherwise.

I will continue to use them sporadically, but I will be on the lookout for another solution.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've owned other bone conducting head brands and always accidentally snapped the arms at the ear hook.  This is the only brand that can survive my abuse and lack of using a case.  The first pair I retired because it wouldn't hold a charge after 2 years but I used it every day so that's pretty normal. The second pair I accidentally ran over with my office chair. I don't know how I snapped the arm on the 3rd pair but they were thrown in my backpack unprotected  I'm still using the 4th and 5th pair.

The only complaint is that sound quality of a call is as good as any other ear based Bluetooth I've used, good but not great,  but some people struggle to hear me. it also picks up small background sounds from all around.

I was bragging to all my co-workers that I had the ability to listen with both ears and not get in trouble with the managers because technically it was safe for the work space. I could react if somebody said ""WATCH OUT!""

I was very happy with my purchase until....

The right ear stopped working. I can't hear anything out of it but a very faint buzz. Like someone turned the volume on the right ear down to 0.5. I've disconnected. Reset. And reconnected with other devices and nada.

What happened to it? I don't know.
Was it me? Did I use it too much? Did I hit it against something while putting it away? I don't know ... All I know is I am not in the position to buy another one and I'm sad that this great piece of technology lasted for as long as it did.

If it was 15 bucks if buy another. But it's not. Far from it. Therefore, I am leaving a 4 star.
It was working fine until it wasn't.

I would still buy this again....maybe upgrade to the 3rd Gen.

My cousin first showed them to me and thought they were pretty nifty. Took me awhile before I actually purchased them since I had other wireless headphones but once my old pair died I purchased these to replace them.

These headphones are great for wearing all day. I can listen to music while I work but if someone comes up to my desk I can hear them just fine. I could see these being very helpful while on public transit, listening to music or a show but also being able to hear your stop coming up next, instead of always having to look up to see if your stop is coming up.

I also recently took these on a trip. With the included ear plugs I was able to block out all airplane noise. Even my previous active noise canceling headphones couldn't do that. Not only did it block out all the background noise but the sound quality goes from 3/5 stars to 5/5. You get real deep bass, if that's your thing, noise canceling, and the ability to wear them in public while not shutting everything out if you still need to pay attention.

These headphones also allow you to be paired to multiple devices at once. This is great if you are normally listening to music from your phone but now you want to watch a movie on your iPad or laptop it will automatically shift over to whatever is playing sound without having to pair and re-pair. It did take me reading the directions when I got my newest pair to figure that out but now I don't have to worry about it.

Overall these headphones are perfect.

I often couldn't hear cars, people, or other dogs and relied on my sight for safety. These headphones allow me to listen to podcasts, music, and audiobooks while running, all while being able to hear everything around me. I use these exclusively around the house because it allows me to hear my son if he needs me or able to hear other noise around the house.

Sound quality wise, it is pretty good, and I definitely enjoy listening music and podcasts with them. It is not the best, but it is surprisingly good for conduction headphones. I gave it four stars because the loop that goes over the top of your ears does settle and dig into your ears, which can be uncomfortable. Because of it being a conduction headphone, I don't know how you can design a better band to relieve the pressure from top of the ears, but that is my only complaint.

Battery life is about 4 to 5 hours of listening and the headphone does a good job charging pretty fast.

I have a large head so these fit fine, they do sell a smaller pair so Im not sure if they would fit better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

As a runner, I want to be aware of what’s going on around me, like dogs, cars, etc.  The AfterShokz bone conduction headphones fill that need.  I can listen to music yet still hear nearby environmental sounds.  Sound quality is good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/AfterShokz-Conduction-Headphones-Reflective-AS600SG-BR/product-reviews/B07G3JMPBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
