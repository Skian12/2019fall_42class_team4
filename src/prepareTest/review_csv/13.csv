Price is Right.","May 11, 2017","These headphones are pretty much exactly what I needed for listening to music while I work. The price was right, and the quality and sound are good. The cord is a tiny bit shorter than my previous headphones, but then, the old ones only got mono sound when they worked and are now totally broken, so these are a vast improvement. ;)

I would have given these 5 stars except that I find they're just a tiny bit too big and don't quite sit on my head properly. I've never experienced that problem before, so it seems that these might be made a tiny bit larger than standard headphones. It doesn't affect listening ability since the tension holds the ear pieces in place, but it's worth noting. They are adjustable, but I have them positioned as small as they will go.

My hearing is weak on treble, however, so don't be swayed by this part of my review.  In a noisy environment such as an airplane, however, you need clear treble.  Ear cushions are quite small.  Fits tightly against the ears.  Not sure how comfortable they will be over an hour or two.  Folds up as shown, so will be nice for travel.  If you are bald, as I am, you will need to apply some mole skin or similar padding to the head band.

They are NOT as good as the Sennheiser 100's they are replacing, but for a cost that is 10% of those, these are just fine for the gym. They are perfectly acceptable for working out, but a few things I noticed are as folows:
1. Not as loud as Senneheiser - these just barely get loud enough on quiet songs for my iPod Nano
2. Not as comfortable - these are not uncomfortable (everyones head is different - right?), but feel a little harder on the ears and the head band is scratchy when you put around your neck.
3. These are brighter (less warmth and bass response) , but sound is pretty accurate overall and tweaking the EQ helps some.

Overall, these are a great deal for active people who need a cheap set of headphones. I would not give it 4 stars if it was more expensive, but value is part of the equation here.

They're very light and produce clear sounds. However as you can probably guess from the size, they won't go as high a volume without distortion or give you much bass. I bought these because during summer wearing my over-the-ear headphones can get a little stuffy on the computer and I wanted light headphones that feel like I'm not wearing them.

So far these feel great and light enough that I almost feel like I'm not wearing any headphones. Also, they have not caused any discomfort to my ears after 5 hours of constant use. They stay on the ears very well and will not fall off even when I shake my head hard.

I give 4/5 for comfort. I feel the cushion on these headphones should be a little thicker on the edges because the plastic edges can be felt on the ears and is not as comfortable as I'd like it.

Also the sound gets 4/5 because it's easily distorted with high volume, volume doesn't go high enough in some applications, and although the bass is present, it's weak.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I prefer this style of headphone for running, where earbuds often work their way out (via movement, sweat, or both) and become terribly uncomfortable.  Because Sony discontinued their headphones, I have been looking for equivalent, inexpensive headphones for running.
I have previously purchased various other brand headphones to try to find a replacement, but none were comparable. Some had terrible (and quiet) sound, some had uncomfortable bands, some broke, some had poor cords (""straight"" plugs vs 90 degree angle, single cords that swung to one side, long cords that dragged the ground due to length, etc.).

FINALLY, found a great replacement.  These headphones have the best sound of any of the 8+ headphones I've tried in the past...and not just passable sound, but GOOD sound.  Also, they are rugged and good fitting with a solid, but not tight band.  The 90 degree plug-in end is preferred, and the cord is not too long or too short (probably about 40 inches or so).  To top it off, they are very inexpensive.

Technically, I'd give this 6 stars and then drop a star so that's how it's at 5. :P haha

First off, I'd like to say that I'm not the average user. I'm pretty knowledgeable with tech and I'm also big on keeping devices for a long time. I think it's a rather poor decision to spend more than 10 bucks on headphones or earpieces if they end up getting damaged after a few months. I like to spend less money but also get the most time out of anything I get. I've had earphones for 4 years before. This lasted me 2 years.

They've lasted me a long time but sadly, I can't use them anymore. It's not because the wiring was bad or anything. Unlike most headphones, these hold up very well with the wiring and I never had an issue where my left side stopped working or anything. It's well made wiring and never even worried about it getting damaged.

In fact, the only reason why I can't use them anymore is because the plastic above each earpiece broke. I've tried to fix it with super glue and at one point, only one was broken so I had used a rubber band as a form of a string. (I figured it'd allow to stretch more and plus, I use this mostly in my room and not outside. I did use this a lot for when I traveled on the plane however.) After a while, I was content, but then the other side also broke. At this point, it was just extremely frustrating and disappointing. But, for the fact that I've had these headphones for 2 years, I figured it was fine. Spending less than 15 dollars for something that helped me for 2 years was great.

Definitely worth the price and your time. You'll be glad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I didn't want earbuds as they hurt my ears, I didn't want a microphone, I didn't need noise canceling etc. etc. etc... I just wanted something that I could use with my laptop when I'm listening to music and watching a movie. Long story short these are AMAZING! I have a headset that I use for gaming and believe it or not I think the sound quality is better on these ""cheap"" headphones!

Pros:
-Comfortable! I can't tell you how much earbuds and other headphones hurt my ears. These are actually comfortable!
-Sound quality. OMG! I am listening to music right now with these and I feel like I'm right there at the concert.
-Lightweight. They are so light it doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything on my head.
-Price. You can't get this great quality for this low of a price from anywhere else.

Cons:
-NONE. I don't have any cons personally and have thoroughly enjoyed this product so far.

I give it 5 out of 5 stars because it's an amazing product that was super cheap and does everything that I want.

I recommend these headphones to anyone who's fed up of buying expensive headphones but want good quality. I also recommend this to anyone that has had any neck problems from previous headphones as these are super light and you will forget that they are on your head in you aren't listening to anything.

I bought these because I'd heard rumors that Panasonic makes good, and CHEAP, headphones. If these cans are any indication those rumors are true. Their sound, especially considering the price, while not perfect by any means is quite good. And the comfort factor is also good, at least for my head. The ear pads appear to be easy to replace, but the cord is not. But who cares, because for the money a new pair of headphones can be bought. So if your pet lynx chews the cord off, or you neighbor's anteater eats the ear pads you can just buy a new pair of these headphones instead of fiddling around replacing parts. So, the little Panasonics get five stars from me because their price to performance ratio is spot-on, unlike some very expensive, and underwhelming headphones which I've run into.

My experience with these have been absolutely amazing!
The sound is incredibly balanced, highs aren't piercing, the bass isn't over emphasized nor does it feel under powered, and the mids just fit right in!
Personally for me, I thought the bass was damn impressive for these headphones!

These are so cheap in price, yet sound so great!? Personally, i wasn't expecting such good sound quality from cheap headphones,
but I am absolutely stunned and will say that these are entirely worth it!

If you're someone who needs something simple, great sounding yet does a great job and not expensive... I recommend these whole hardheartedly!
These feel light and build quality is good. No creaking from the plastics when turning your head or putting the headphones on.

Keep in mind though - These will sound quiet when connected to your phone, the computer does a far better job or even a receiver with amplifying it properly.
You can always consider buying or using software based amplifier on your PC or use a hardware based instead, as these do need some power input in order to produce a louder sound.

These are not professional or studio-grade headphones, so I'm primarily reviewing them against others in their price class.

Bass: 5/5 - These headphones have terrific bass, some of the best bass I have heard in this form factor, nevermind at this price range.

Mid-range: 4.5/5 - The mid-range tones seem a touch on the soft side, though this may be partly due to the outstanding bass, I find myself raising the equalizer slightly in these ranges.

High: 4.5/5 - The upper range is smooth and completely lacking the tinny sound expected from cheap headphones. I did notice a VERY slight buzz at loud volumes when listening to a couple of extremely (extremely) high notes. Not enough or often enough to be a problem, it only affects certain pitches (I have had two different soprano singers trigger it), and even then is hardly noticeable 90% of the time, unless you are listening at a very high volume.

Construction: 5/5 - They are fairly sturdy and have survived several drops already with no discernible damage to sound quality. The rotating axles that attache the earpieces to the overhead band have noticably different tolerances, as one earpiece tilts freely, while the other grips the earpiece more firmly, but that is a minor inconsistency and does not cause any discomfort.

Leakage: 5/5 - These headphones have very little sound leakage. Sitting less than 3 feet away, they are entirely inaudible through quite high volumes.

Overall: 5/5

These are definitely the best headphones I have ever used in this price range, hands down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Unlike most headphones which tend to be pronounced in the 1k-2k range, these are VERY pronounced in the 250Hz-800Hz range, very muffled and boomy, I had to slam my 500Hz EQ slider all the way to the bottom and crank the highs to get these to sound normal--my EQ curve looks like a big checkmark.

I have an older Panasonic set that sounds pretty good but has an obnoxious 20' cord that makes them completely useless for any application other than listening at home (WTF were they thinking?!) so I was hoping these would be suitable for office and out-and-about use, but I just can't deal with the sound quality. On anything without an EQ these would be absolutely unlistenable for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Helgeson","A (really) poor man's PortaPro","March 13, 2011","Yeah, I said it.  These sound an awful lot like the Koss PortaPro, for about a sixth of the price (and the PortaPro is cheap as it is!).  I've A-B'ed them, and the bass is *almost* on par.  Seriously.  The big difference in sound signature lies in the mids.  I think these have more pronounced mids.  They seem a smidge more fatiguing to listen to in general, but nowhere near enough to be concerned.

Fit might be objectionable for some--they're super-light, but the drivers are actually tilted *backward* slightly, such that the clamping force of the phones presses only against the area in *front* of your ear--not really *on* the ear itself.  The drivers definitely rest over your ear, but the ""on-ear"" pressure is negligible.  The only pressure at all is closer to your temples.  Personally, I love this design, because it shifts any pressure to a nice, flat bony area (at least on my head), rather than into my ear cartilage.  But I could see some finding the fit to be strange.

So no, they don't fold flat like the Coby CV185, or clip into a cool ball like a PortaPro, and no, they're not quite as comfortable as a KTX1Pro, but then, what is?  (I have a very tall head, and I think the KTX1s are just about the most comfortable set of cans under $100, but that's just me.)  These cans' back-to-basics design is outright refreshing.  So, of the three (the Coby, the PortaPro, and the KTX1Pro), I have to give these the nod for street wear.

Oh, and did ya notice that they're RIDICULOUSLY cheap?  For the price of a swanky cup of coffee, there's not much to lose.  If you really have money to burn, try the RP-HT46(?), which is the same as these, only there's a volume control (I think), and they FOLD!  But if you're just skatin' on the seriously cheap, yeah, these are them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I chose the over the ear type instead of buds because we were losing buds at the rate of 2 or 3 a week (seriously) between our house and our mini-van A/V setup. I figured over the ear headphones would be harder to lose for the kids and easier for me to find since 1) they were bigger and 2) the kids did not want to be seen outside the house with these :-). Also, losing headphones at this price point versus $20 ear buds is a little more tolerable.

Simply stated, for the price point, they cannot be beat.  Build quality was not bad at all and I would classify them as durable.  In fact, on the two sets I purchased, I found it to be better than expected. In terms of design, I think the best word to describe it could be: utilitarian.  The headphones are very light weight. We found the cord more than long enough to plug into the headphone port of our monitors or laptops.  BUT, if you need to run the cord a long length, like to the back to a CPU under the desk, you will need a simple extension such as Stereo Headphone Extension 12 feet 3.5mm.  The over the ear padding was more than sufficient for its purpose in my opinion. However, other reviewers have remarked otherwise. The headphones are adjustable enough that they fit a wide range of heads in my house from mine, to both my 6 and 12 year old.

Sound quality is OK.  That's about it. However, that was all I was looking for.  For serious sound, my children and I rely on better quality ear buds anywhere from the $8 to $35 range.

For the right purpose, you will not be disappointed in these headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Only my right ear works, so I usually don't go too expensive on headphones because it'd be light buying Air Jordans if you only have one foot.  That said, this is the worst sounding set of name brand headphones I've ever heard.  I get that they're only $16, but if you're going to make such a bad product, why bother producing it at all, because it really just hurts your brand.  Anyways, there was no bass...NONE.  I usually don't care for thumpy bass with my music, but there has to be something there on the lower end.  Unfortunately, the high end didn't fare any better.

The plastic headband may not work well for bigheads (despite what my wife says, I do NOT have a big head!). I wear a 7 1/2 hat and they are perfect without even extending the ear pads.

When you see awesome reviews of a $5 product, you have to wonder, ""Is this product truly awesome or is it just awesome for a $5 product?""

Well, in my opinion, this product is truly awesome, made awesomer by its price. I don't think I've ever had headphones of this quality before. I think the sound quality is even better than that of my 2.1 speaker set, subwoofer and all (though granted, it was a fairly cheap set itself, but still sounded great!). I've never had very expensive headphones, but these are even cheaper than all of the ones I've owned previously and yet these own all of them, hands down.

My only lament is that these aren't in-ear earbuds or at least noise-isolating in some way, but that's just not what this product is. That'd be like complaining that a really tasty chocolate ice cream isn't vanilla; I ordered chocolate knowing and expecting it to be chocolate, and even if I prefer vanilla and wish that that amazing ice cream came in that flavor, that shouldn't change my review of that chocolate ice cream.

Don't want to waste money on something that could be broken on the first day.  3 months later, I am still wearing the first pair.  Still holding up.

The noise levels where I work with running machinery can get a little loud.  I need on the ear versus over or in the ear so I can still hear what is going on.  I know it has more to do with the sound output with the device I listen to, but it is just loud enough that I can still hear the music and what is going on around me.  In a quite environment, the sound is superb.  I can hear nuances in my music that I never heard before, even with the earbuds.  It is really a quality sound that I didn't not expect (nor did I really need) from an inexpensive pair of headphones.

The foam over the speakers is thin, but have held up quite nicely after absorbing sweat.  I thought they would have started to deteriorate already, but they have not.

In all honesty, I just bought them to use at my computer, and maybe to plug into my keyboard to practice without disturbing the rest of the family.  Makes my piano sound rich and full, and that kind of surprised me.  But, to be honest, this is a great example of getting what you pay for.  There is no padding whatsoever on the headband and after a few minutes it begins to cause some pain on the top of my head, and the ear pads just sit on top of your ears (do on cover them) which also becomes most uncomfortable to me in a short while.  I have learned to adjust them upward a bit to alleviate the discomfort.  In the end, this just solidifies my love/hate relationship with Panasonic - - sometimes great quality, sometimes not.

Its hard to find good on-ear headphones these days without looking you've got cans coming out of your ears. I wear hearing aids, and a lot of the time the cups on a lot of headphones, even more so with cheep headphones, make my hearing aids give feedback. With on-ear headphones this is not the case and I can mostly wear them on top of my hearing aids or pull them to in front of below my ears and still hear them. I can also hear conversations going on around me, and no one has to shout at me to get my attenion.
After reading a lot of the reviews of these headphones, I ordered them. They are lite, and the headband is nice and big. I can see them giving some trouble with someone with a smaller head, but for the most part this shouldn't have a problem. The padding is also nice. It doesn't feel scrachy to the hand, and more importently to the ears. You could easily wear these headphones for hours while doing some work on the computer, or while listenning to some audio around the house. The cord is nice and long so you could step away from a tablet or a computer or stuff the extra cord into your pocket along with your phone if you're moving around.
The sound for these headphones is great. You get a lot of the highs, a lot of the lows, and surprisingly a lot of bass. I'm no audiofile, but I couldn't be happier with these headphones. For such lite headphones the sound is great! If you're not expecting a great sound for 50+ headphones, these headphones I'd say sound anywhere from $10 to $30. If you know the limitiations of these headphones and don't expect them to sound like a $100+ pare of cans, you'll be surprised at how well these little guys sound.
I wouldn't use these at an office, unless its your home office though, on-ear headphones tend to leek a lot of sound.

Pros:
- Really amazing quality, great bass, love them!
- On-ear so your ears don't hurt even after using them for 3+ hours
- I use this for gaming since noise-cancelling ones make it hard to talk to other people (when playing together in the same room we still use headphones so the game sounds don't play from each person's computer)
- Easy to use and hassle free

- None that I've experienced","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

What they do ok is provide good sound and comfort for your ears at a cheap price.  I use exclusively for watching movies on laptop.  What they don't do and I thought they did is noise cancellation to a point, certainly I didn't expect Bose level.  If you're the only one in the house and control noise around you no problem.  If my wife is watching TV in same room, they let in far too much noise.  The ear bud type headphones do a much better job of blocking noise.

They do leak very badly though, if that's a concern for you (i.e. others may hear your music if it's very loud).
They do get a bit uncomfortable if you wear them for over a couple hours, because they put a bit of pressure on the ear; but maybe that's just me.
My one complaint is that recently the adjustable notches on the right side went loose on mine, so it slides up and down when I take them off; but they still stay in place just fine when I'm wearing them.

I had these years ago and had forgotten how surprisingly good they are for the money. I think it's likely that this pair of headphones must be one of the most popular in the world. I've seen them all over the place.
Their sound quality is shocking for such an unassuming product at such a frugal price. Base is fully heard, rich and deep, but not booming or muddy as it can be in some augmented headphones. Treble and midrange are bright and detailed. It's actually hard to believe that such frequency reproduction can come from these tiny little drivers.
What about them explains an eight dollar price? Oh, well, they're very cheap plastic, and I'm sure they'd snap in half very easily. There is no noise cancelling effect whatsoever. They're a bit uncomfortable after some time.
If you're in a pinch or want some wonderful portable headphones to run around with, and are disgusted by ear buds as much as I am, and if you're a well-coordinated adult who can be a bit careful not to break them (ha ha!), I doubt you can do any better than these at such a teeny price.

Pros:
1. Cheap
2. Good sound (bass and treble)
3. Light

Cons:
1. Quiet (need to crank the volume to get sound out)
2. Can easily be overpowered by outside noise in a noisy setting (e.g. public transit bus)
3. Might be too fragile

Overall they sound good but because they are quiet and can get lost in outside noise they don't do me much good.

I used a different set of these same phones myself for several months some time ago. I listen to audio on my iPod while I walk laps on an indoor track, and I found the sound to be very pleasing to me.

The Koss phones are MUCH more comfortable (I can't stress this enough) and they also sound better. Trust me, your ears will be glad you spend the extra bucks.

I wear the Koss phones for hours each day at work, and they never hurt. These Panasonics hurt after less than an hour. I think it's because the face of the phones isn't parallel with my ears, so the from edge of the earpieces digs into my upper jaw.

REVISED REVIEW:
__

I CAME BACK TO BUY A 5TH & 6TH PAIR OF THESE, AND DISCOVERED THAT THE PRICE HAD TRIPLED (30 BUCKS).
SO, I CHANGED MY MIND AND WENT WITH A PAIR OF SKULLCANDY HEADPHONES.

YES, THEY DO SOUND GREAT, BUT THEY BREAK VERY EASILY... SOME PROBLEM WITH ALL FOUR PAIRS (ONE HEADPHONE CUT EVENTUALLY COMES OUT OF IT'S SOCKET, WHICH IS UNREPAIRABLE... THUS RENDERING THEM USELESS!!!

AT THE $10-$12 PRICEPOINT, I WOULD JUST BUY ADDITIONAL PAIRS. BUT, AT $30 A PAIR... I WOULD SERIOUSLY SUGGEST YOU FIND A MUCH MORE DURABLE PAIR!!! - IF NOT... YOU'LL BE REPLACING THEM WITHIN THE YEAR.
__

DROPPED MY PREVIOUS RATING DOWN TO THREE (3) STARS!!!

At this price point, don't expect high-end audio... but they are decent and a great deal for the price.

As I mentioned before... not very durable. I dropped a pair and when it hit the carpeted floor it cracked the left ear piece and it fell off.
Luckily, I had bought two when I ordered them... so I had a backup. I bought a third pair, in case something like that should happen again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound quality is excellent. I have used the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 earphones and the Panasonic quality is light years ahead.. Panasonic headphones are super light and that causes zero irritation to the ears.

I have compared sound quality with Sony noise cancellation headphones which cost 80-100$ and believe me, they are worthless. They are heavy, too hard on people with bigger ears and sound quality is no where near the Panasonic.

All in all, this product is a clear winner. My last piece was bought 5 months back and they have same quality as before. Put them on and relax to enjoy wonderful sound quality for really low price.

Overall fairly pleased on that aspect.  The inline volume control is a nice bonus.

Physically they are very uncomfortable to wear. They're okay on the ears, but the center of the headband folds for transportation/storage... and that center has a ridge that cuts right into the top of your head.

Since I didn't have anything to glue on the inside of the headband to pad them, I returned them for being the most poorly-designed headband on the market.

I usually just use typical iPod ear buds for regular use and a couple of brands of over-the-ear headphones for holding in place during running and strenuous workouts.  My plan for these headphones was for using while outside working in the lawn with mowers and other machinery running.  I realized that they wouldn't silence other sounds in the way that the much heavier, fully padded/insulated headphones do...but I had expectations of them being able to deaden outside noises as much or more than regular ear buds.  I was reluctant to wear the heavier headphones that completely surround your ears while outside working since I didn't want to completely tune out what was happening around me.

It didn't take long to come to the conclusion that they offer nothing at all in the way of outside sound reduction.  The in-your-ear buds cover outside noise better than these do.  So, I thought...oh well, I'll just use them for regular indoor listening.  They're certainly comfortable enough.  But, they don't stay on...or at least they don't stay on me.  I have to remain perfectly motionless or else they slide off my ears.

The sound clarity is decent for the price.  The cable is plenty long at about 4.5.'  The XBS port is supposed to offer increased bass response.  I maybe noticed a bit of difference there; but it's of little help when the headphones won't stay in place on my ears.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

But they last long enough that they are totally worth it. Each pair seems to last me a couple of years with daily use.  They are perfect for more risky situations where you may have concern your equipment could get banged up or lost, or kids might get a hold of them. If they get smashed, who cares. Buy another. I bought like 4 or 5 of these. Totally worth it for situations where you don't want to take your expensive headphones.

Sound quality is acceptable. If you're an audiophile, then you won't be satisfied with the quality. I use them for video streaming, video games, listening to music, etc and it always seems ok to me.

Casteel","They're cheap; but they're cheap","March 9, 2012","I've always had a problem with headphones.  They never last very long.  Maybe I just handle them too roughly; but, usually after only a few months of use, they tend to wear out on me.  Most of the time the problem seems to be a short in the cord.  When this happens, I can only hear out of one ear unless I hold the cord juuuuuuust right.  Anyway, I always end up having to replace my headphones at least a couple of times a year, no matter which brand or model I buy; so the cheaper I can get them, the better.  These headphones actually work quite well; and they are inexpensive.  The only drawback is that they wear out on me pretty quickly.  Anyway, it's time for me to replace the ones I bought about six months ago; but I'm going to go with the same model once again, because they're so reasonably priced.  Yeah, I know that this isn't exactly a ringing endorsement; but I've had the same problems with just about every pair of headphones I've ever owned.  These are certainly no worse than any of the others; and at least they're not very expensive to replace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

For the price these headphones are awesome. They're very comfortable and don't press very hard into your head. They sound pretty okay.

I can say from personal experience that these headphones sound better, last longer, and are more comfortable than models costing two or three times as much.

Panasonic, please make a version of these that has an elastic cord pull guard, and has maybe a more sporty/athlete look so that I can look cool jogging. Maybe a behind-the-neck style.

The price makes it a steal pretty much given the brand and the quality it provides. It's rich with enhancing features such as the longer cord that allows for more movement (was a must for me, the short cord problem I had was starting to drive me insane), surprisingly lightweight (than was expected ) which will make longer sessions more comfortable, plush padded ear pads for more comfort.

They are comfortable and durable. I am using them in my Sangean DT-120 radio.  The cord is about 4 feet long so you can put the radio in your pocket and still havde plenty of length remaining.  The headphones are adjustable to fit various head sizes.  I have worn them over a hat.  The main disappointment is the sound level.  The stereo quality is adequate, but I have to turn up the volume on my radio to almost full to get a suitable listening level when outside to compensate for outside noise (traffic etc.). By comparison, my Sony earbuds give the same sound volume at 1/4 of the sound level on my radio.  These headphone have a high impedence level (24 ohms).  Could this be the cause?  I'm not an electronics expert, but I have not seen this high of an impedence on other headphones.

To conclude, the headphones were very cheap. Less than $5.00.  For the money they are a good buy.  If you intend to use them for talk radio or listening to sports, they will done fine.

They can be worn for up to half an hour or so without issue, but beyond that, the continued pressure makes them extremely uncomfortable.  Additionally, the sound quality is very low compared to other headphones I've used at a similar price.

Update: After several months of having to use these, they're still uncomfortable, but much less painful and could finally be used for a reasonable length of time after about two months of adjustment.  However, they are exceptionally flimsy; one side of the headphones refuses to remain the same length, and just slides freely, meaning they have to be adjusted every single time they're taken off or put on.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Are they the best headphones out there?  Absolutely not but they're not advertised as being the best are they?  They're not noise cancelling but I've purchased 7 sets so far because they are a great deal.  I've used them at work in an office and I can still hear the phone ring and the sound quality is great for use with my smartphone or my work PC.  If you don't want to spend a lot of money you'll be very happy with these headphones.  There are better headphones out there but you're also not going to get them for the cost of these headphones.  They don't last forever but at this price I get very good mileage out of them and I look for them again when I need a new economy headphone.  The sound quality is great for the price as well.

But I still wanted to get him something fairly decent and not some total junk. I read the reviews on these Panasonics and they seemed to be just what I was looking for. When I received them I was surprised how nice the packaging was. They looked like they would cost a lot more than four bucks. After he got them on Christmas morning I wanted to see what they sounded like so I pulled some music up on his new tablet. I was blown away at how good they sounded for a four dollar pair of headphones. I doubt there's any other 'phones in this price range that could compare with these Panasonics.

They won't last you for ever, but they do outlast other headphones of the price point.","June 28, 2017","These  sound great.  They're indeed very light weight. They have a gentle fit so don't hurt your ears squeezing them against the sides of your head etc. They're a lot like the old time Sony Walkman style headphones that came with those little cassette players.

They're probably fairly durable, but I wear these for hours every single day. I buy 3 or so at a time and unbox the next one when I finish the one I'm wearing off. The quickest I've ever finished one off was around 3 weeks, but they usually last 4 months or so.

The bass is there, but not overpowering. It's just right, not too much mid, and not too much high. I'm blind so my computer is talking to me constantly when I'm using it. I'm also profoundly deaf, so wear behind the ear hearing aids. These fit well against the aids if I turn them around backward. The downside to that is the stereo field is reversed. The flat pads on these don't try to wrap around your ear or cancel out environmental sound. They are very gentle in terms of causing hearing aids to experience feedback. I can wear them for many hours without getting tired of having them on. They don't press the backs of my ear against the aid and produce sore spots and the like.

The cable is not overly thick, not ridiculously thin either - probably just about right for the price. The plug is an l shaped, sticks out of your device about 1 cm before the 90 degree turn, then the sleeve ends 7/8th of an inch. The wire splits about 14 inches from the earphones with a little plastic gizmo that does not slide up or down. It sends one wire to each earphone.

The earphones are on a slide thing that's in the headband, you can slide them out for a bigger head. I always keep them all the way slid in, that's the best fit for my hearing aids. All the way slid in, worn backward with the headband tilted way forward and nearly on my forehead. If it sounds  weird it's because it is, but it works, and works for many hours every day.

If I want to complain, it would be that I kind of wish they had a straight plug, with a short jacket on it, and I wish they had an integrated decent quality microphone. I've driven myself crazy trying to find a headset that looks sort of like these do, has flat pads, sounds ok, will sit on my hearing aids, etc, etc, while having a  microphone that, a: doesn't have a short and allow the person on the other end to hear my computer talking as though it's actually their computer talking, even though I'm freaking wearing headphones, and b: refuse to sound decent.

The most common failure point for these have been one or the other of the earphones will become quieter. Once or twice one will completely stop working and I can affect it by pushing the cord up into the bottom of that earphone, but usually it just grows quieter. This is most often after a few hundred hours of usage though, and I'm not disappointed. For the price, I honestly don't think these can be beat in terms of durability and sound quality. They're above average any way I slice it for sound quality. They won't hold up against Bowse and the like but they're quite impressive anyhow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wanted a cheap pair of headphones that were lightweight and fit comfortably. Here is my comparison:

1. Sound Quality: These Panasonic ones win. The bass is better and the sound is clearer.

2. Comfort: Koss won this one, by a small margin. They are both very comfortable, but the Koss ones were so comfortable, I could probably wear them for hours without needing to take them off.

For the incredibly low price, I feel like both these Panasonic ones and the Koss ones were worth buying.

UPDATE: About 5 months after I bought these, the sound started going out. The headphones now have that problem where the audio goes out in one side when you adjust the volume level. I can only set the volume at very loud or very quiet if I want both sides to work. Overall, I'm not surprised, given the price.

I had been using a headphone with ear buds but they tend to fall out of my ears, so I bought this.  As soon as I opened the package and tried to plug this  Panasonic XBS RP-HT21 headphone into my phone, I realized it was not going to work because the plug on the cord would not fit into the phone's jack with the protective case I keep on my phone.  So, at that point, I was thinking I simply would not be able to use this headphone in the way I had hoped.  But, later, I thought of a possible solution; I tried it and it solved the problem for me.  What I did was use a utility knife to carefully cut about 1/16"" of the outer black covering on the plug, thereby exposing the white inner wire casing (see photo for a picture of this). Since this reduced the diameter of the plug near the jack on my phone, I was then able to get a proper connection when connecting the cable to my phone.

Edit (4/3/19): Just thought I'd add that sound is quite good for such an inexpensive headphone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However, it has one Achilles Heal: The right-angle 3.5mm plug at the end of the cord is prone to internal breakage.
All these reviews citing one speaker going out unless you hold the cord just right, or one speaker dying after a few weeks, are probably due to this weakness.

I've owned 5 pairs over the past few years and all have died for this reason. Mine last from 6 months to a year.

I play solo acoustic guitar and I want phones that accurately reproduce the guitar's sound.  These phones do it well.  They have a good bass without it being overpowering.

Just as good as my more expensive phones and much better than my expensive ear buds. I still can't believe what I'm hearing. Excellent. Yes they are wired but so what. I still can't believe the quality of the sound. Not too much base and the mid range and highs all were great. I'm not an audiophile by any means but I know what my ears like. This would had received 5 stars except for a couple of minor details. The cord is too long. It tangled horribly. The second problem is a bit more daunting. The jack is a bit short and because of my phone protective case doesn't stay plugged in.

All in all a great pair of ear phones. Buy!

WORK:
I plug my headphones into a 2 foot extender which plugs into the headphone jack of the computer. I've noticed no loss of sound quality.

The very first time I put these on and watched a demo video, I was shocked at the ""surround sound feel"", so much so, I looked around, thinking someone else was playing a video. The sound is VERY clear, you can hear all instrumentation in the background. On my old cheapy headphones, I had to have the volume at least 10-12 bars high to hear, with these, 3-4 bars will do perfectly. This shows the large range of volume these have.

I was pleasantly surprised that the ear ""piece"" actually swivels in and out for a better fit to your head. It took a week to get used to the large, flat cushioned ear piece (it kind of smashed my ear), but I barely notice now.

CON:
I thought the wide head band would fit better on my head, but for some reason, even sitting still at a desk, these still slide backwards on the smallest setting. The surface is extremely smooth, no grip, which is probably the reason. It's the only annoyance I have with these.

JOGGING/EXERCISING:
I had some slippage as well while jogging, but again, will have to play with the adjustments. Note: The ear cushions are large and if you sweat a bit, this will make it a bit uncomfortable as they will get wet. (However, it's better then ear buds constantly falling out of your ears)

All in all, these are PERFECT for the price of a basic user. I'm VERY happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Mind blown!","June 26, 2016","I use earbuds most of the time now. I had been disappointed with on the ear headphones sound quality, and over the ear headphones are too bulky, and press in on my glasses. I bought these for my 3 year old for a trip on an airplane. My 6 year old wanted to use my over the ear headphones I use for editing, and I was okay with that, I didn't use them often anymore. When I took them out to use them, the pads and headband had deteriorating plastic covers, and I wound up putting them away, and they will probably get thrown out. So I went to the local store for a cheap pair of RCA headphones.

Well, when it was about time for the trip, I unpacked them both and tested them. These blew me away. The bass was amazing. And compared to the RCA headphones, it was no contest. My 6 year old cares enough that he wants to use them.  The 3 year old will use the RCAs, and will probably be happy. I will probably use earbuds, or my Sony a35s, as I have been, but I won't be afraid to use these in the future, if the 6 year old will let me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

(model RP-HT227-K)","September 22, 2016","Edit: Please note that this review is showing up on multiple models of Panasonic headphones, and may not be relevant to the one you're actually looking at. (Not okay, Amazon.) I only realized this when trying to review a better model brought me here.

I think the model# of the set I panned was RP-HT227-K, for the record.

The sound on the pair I received is pretty good for a lightweight headset. Which is why I really hate to have to downrate and return them because the plug is junk. It doesn't socket snugly, so the slightest bump or movement, even as simple as turning the phone upside down, causes static, partial loss of sound, or often a complete stop of the music (because playback pauses automatically when the phone detects the headset disconnecting).

I've had some touchy plugs in my lifetime, but this one takes the cake. Unless you plan to remain perfectly motionless or duct tape the plug semipermanently in place, this issue makes an otherwise passable headset about as useless, especially with a mobile phone, as a portable CD player with no antishock.... for those of us who remember that ""fun"".

Note: I've used four other light headsets with this Android phone (six, if you count headsets with mic for calls, rather than listen-only), of different brands and designs, some of which I still own for current comparison. None of them had or have this issue. There's no question that the fault is with the plug, and not the socket.

It's disappointing, because the sound is fine, and they're comfortable, without the painful and poorly executed excess of bass that's become so common in lightweight headsets. :/ Back to the search...","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Let's get it out of the way.  These are NOT going to let you hear the intricate sounds of a flute concerto nor is it going to melt the wax in your ears with ground-pounding bass.  These will fold up, slip into a cargo pocket, and, when needed, deliver decent sound from your media player.

I have a medium sized head, based on the baseball caps I have, and these are very comfortable.  No pinching preasure on the sides of my head and the headband doesn't leave the top of my head feeling sore.  The hinges fold with a purpose, no unnecessary looseness or resistance.  When folded, it stays folded.  Finally, because they're on-ear, they wont add pressure to your glasses (causing them to shift).

Overall, I'm very satisfied with these headphones.  If you don't like earbuds or earphones and can sacrifice sound quality for convenience, I'd recommend you take these for a spin.  For as little as 12 bucks, you can get them just to see what they're like.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Best, most durable, decent sounding headphones that give so so much value for money.
You don't have to read the entire review. You can just buy and try them out. You won't even feel bad if you don't like them for whatever reason because they cost less than a Subway Footlong.

I bought these headphones in the Spring of 2011 for an astonishing $4.58. That's the most I could afford back then and I wasn't expecting a lot out of them. All I wanted was a device so that my roommates wouldn't have to listen to me practice amateur keyboard.
I was waiting to write the review till something went wrong with these headphones. I am glad I had to wait 3 years! In fact, it's been more than 3 years and today, the pad on one of the sides tore. After thousands of hours of usage, the only thing wrong with them now is that the soft, cushiony pad tore.

Durability: 10/10
These are the most durable headphones. The wire is intact. The headband is intact with its adjustment mechanism working just fine. The earpieces are fine. And all this with its fair share of getting tugged and tangled and dropped and stepped on. Not just the headphones category but considering all categories, I cannot think of a single product that was less than $5 and has been usable for over 3 years.

Comfort: 10/10
They are extremely lightweight; so much so that you could forget you have them on if no sound were playing.
The headband doesn't press on your ears and is sufficiently adjustable.

Sound quality: 7/10
It has a surprisingly soft and rich bass with good, sharp mid and treble sound. It is no Bose or Audio-Technica but neither does it cost as much. It is 1/20th the cost of a Bose AE2. It is also sufficiently loud and the sound doesn't crack at max volume.
All this make them perfect for music, movies, podcasts as well as phone conversations (there is no mic, but still).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I bought both to have a backup in case one stops working. In the last few years I've bought at least 6 which have all stopped working.

The Panasonic RP-HT21 and the Sony MDR-110LP are very similar. Both work well and both are about the same price. Also both can be easily adjusted for different head sizes ranging from a small child to an adult. Just gently pull the band on each side and it will expand.

For me both of these headsets work well. However, the sound on the Panasonic may be a bit better. It seems to be a bit clearer like my old headset which cost several dollars more. My old headset stopped working on one side after only a few months of use. Hopefully these will last longer.

For my purposes the Panasonic is perfect. I use it at my desktop daily to listen to mp3s, movies, youtube videos and all sounds on my computer (including an occasional popup advertisement). So far this seems to be the best headset you can find in this price range. However, if you're a music fanatic and must have more sound control perhaps you'll need to spend more on an expensive headset. Most people, however, should find the RP-HT21 to be perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have owned $150 pairs of headphones whose highs and lows were not as clear and rich as the sound I get from these headphones.  That is not to say that these are amazing sounding, but they're quite good for the price.

I like that these headphones are lightweight and comfortable.  As stated above, over time worn the headphones often become a bit loose  and require adjustment,  which is an issue I haven't had one other headphones.

My first pair lasted for a good couple of years. I replaced them recently with another which started to show signs of a defect after only a week of use.  That defect is an occasional slight rattling in the left speaker when certain frequencies play.  Amazon was quick with a refund.  I'll probably replace the defective pair as at this price they're worth having a set of.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I listen to music at all times, accept in school of course. I prefer headphones that increase the bass and cancel sound around you (noise-canceling). These headphones are PERFECT, meaning that you can really hear the bass and not much else around you. The vocals are really good, and the sound comes through very clearly. I have had them for a month so far and they haven't disappointed me. The only thing is that they are made pretty big, and even the lowest setting is really long. I would not recommend them for running, I've tried and they have fallen off. I would stick to earbuds. But for dancing around the house, working, or on a long car ride, these headphones are definitely worth more then the price they are asking for.

Various types of earbuds either fall out or get sweat on the diaphragm, which makes them unlistenable until they dry out.  I could have gone with the $299 Beats phones like the NFL pros wear on TV commercials, but that seemed like a good way to waste $299 and quickly ruin nice headphones.  For $8, these are perfect.  They get very sweaty, but there's no degradation in sound quality.  But I imagine I'll have to replace the black foam coverings at some point.  Seems that those are easy and cheap to buy though.  Would Bluetooth be nice?  Sure.  But since I stay put on the treadmill or elliptical, these do the trick and sound A-OK for my gym needs.

Update:  I've now been using them for running, and they work great there too.  They stay put on my head and the cord is long enough that there's plenty of slack (but not too much) from my head to my music player in my pocket.  If I wore my music player on my arm, there would probably be too much slack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

As for sound quality, they were quite tinny and had no bass to speak of.

These rank up there with my very expensive headphones as far as sound quality goes in a small package.  Of course you are not going to beat the big bulky head phones that fit snug on your ears though.  These headphones don't hurt your ears after a long time using them like those in-ear (ear buds) do either.  I would not use these head phones for working out though as the tend to slip off of your head.  The more you sweat and move the more they slip.  It is very bothersome when you are using cables and you lean forward and your headphones slide off of your head and hang while you are in the middle of your set.  Bottom line:  If you are just going to walk or sit and listen to your headphones you can not beat these headphones...especially for the money - you just can't.  Now if you are going to workout or do anything that causes movement and sweating, even yard work, then go with something like the Philips SH390 (inexpinsive around $13.00) that are snug.

This has a longer wire than the headphones that came with my Sony Walkman radio so I can hook it to my back pocket and the wire can run up through my layers (and layers and layers) of clothing in the wintertime. Then I am not restricted in my movements worrying about the wire. The sound with these is great and the price is right. I would however, suggest a small clip on the wire somewhere to keep the wire from dangling all over as it is long.

These headphones in and of themselves aren't bad. They're comfortable, somewhat sound-canceling. The sound is not crisp--it's fuzzy--but it isn't terrible. The problem was that the very first time I used them, the sound in each speaker cut in and out as I walked. Poor wiring somewhere. So I tried to return it. NO DICE. This item is not eligible for returns on Amazon. You have to contact Panasonic themselves via phone. I did so. Panasonic said they would only do exchanges, not returns, and I had to contact Amazon (and by the way, Amazon's customer service phone number is 1 (888) 280-4331 and they were lovely).

Ear buds, even more expensive earbuds, hurt my small ears. Larger on-ear and over-ear headphones are awkward, bulky, and can give me headaches.

I always end up returning to these. They're truly lightweight and fit nicely in my purse or backpack. They fit my iPhone and iPad (I'm sure Apple would have something to say about buying proprietary Apple headphones but I've never had a compatibility issue and they've never damaged any of my Apple equipment.) They fit our old portable DVD player. My daughter has also stolen them for her Innotab on occasion. I have even used them on my computer when I couldn't find my better headphones.

As others have noted, the sound quality is top notch for something so small and inexpensive. Bass is nice. Everything sounds rich, nothing sounds tinny. They don't fall off but they don't squeeze my skull to the point of headaches, and the adjustable headband is easy to move but remains solid wherever I adjust it.

I should have read the questions and answers section and it would have confirmed before I bought that these are not ""over-the-ear"" headphones. They sit on the ear.

I probably have about 7 pair at any given time around the house - for my computer; in my gym bag for my mp3 player; connected to the television, in my briefcase - anywhere I want to use headphones.

Essentially I love them because:

***The sound is great - they carry more bass than Sony, Koss and other brand of headphones that I've found at the local drug store and have an all-around great range

***They are shockingly economical

***They are fairly well-made - I wear one set during my daily workouts at the gym and they hold up really well - my current set for about 2 years now

The only con, in my opinion, is that, because the cord extends out of EACH earpiece and then connects over the chest area, it's prone to getting tangled pretty easily in mobile situations, like storing them in a gym bag. Still, that's only a minor complaint and not something to lower a five star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The headphone jack is the old style for CD players. Doesn't fit an iPod case which most people use. The 3.5mm plug fits, yet requires removing any iPod case to fully plug, make full connection. Misleading; this should be specified on product page. I had to return these.

This product would be incredible if you'd update the plug to fit through a iPod case and add a microphone to one of the wires, like Apple earbuds have. This way these could be used for calls with an iPhone as well. I prefer to use lightweight over-ear headphones as ear buds put EMFs to far inside my ear, which causes pain.

I've read where a couple of reviewers have called them ""Good for the price"", but in fact, they're a great deal better than a number of different brands of headphones that are considerably higher priced.

PROS: These headphones, while certainly not symphony quality, are more than adequate for an evening's work or play on my computer, or with my phone and mp3 players. They're lightweight, they're comfortable in the extreme, and I'm impressed with both their higher and bass ranges, sound-wise. Though they're probably considered ""open air"" phones, they do quite a good job of blocking out outside sounds, since they cover most of the ear. Unless it's awfully hot out, they also breathe pretty well, and so don't overheat my ears, even if I've been wearing them for a couple of hours.

CONS: The only real ""con"" I can find with these headphones is that they don't survive ME very well! As I said, this is the second pair of RP-HT21's I've owned, and it's the second pair I've broken an earphone off of! The first pair took it in the neck, so to speak, when I accidentally stepped on them (barefooted, and it wasn't a full-weight crunch, either); the second pair got sat on while on the bed. My fault in both cases, and a bit of tape will hold them together this time. Still, though they still ""wear"" fine, every time I pull them off now, I have to put them back together.

Despite this con, these Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones are worth way more than their price; indeed, they'd be more than worth it at TWICE their price. I will definitely be getting another set of them.

In fact, I think I'll buy a FEW pairs this time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was only a few cents short and I didn't want to have to spend another $3 to $5 in shipping, so I began to look around for little things that I would have considered nice to have just so that I could get another item for that money.  I was very lucky to stumble upon these headphones as they have quickly become my favorite item from that group purchase.  What I thought would have been just a nice, keep to the side just in case item, have become my favorite headset to use on the computer and I use them everyday.

These Panasonics were incredibly cheap when I purchased them (around that $3-5 range) but the quality and sound they have are incredible for that price point.  I have not had a problem with discerning any kind of sound from videos, games, sound effects, etc. They are also very comfortable as the ear portions can slide very far to fit a variety of different head sizes.  The cord is also a good length so that you have a decent amount of room to work with in leaning down from the computer jack or using with an iPod.

I have had no complaints using these headphones and, to be honest, am very surprised at just how good they are.

Lacher","Quality seems to be on the decline.","November 29, 2017","I use headphones nearly everyday for work, so I go though about 4 sets a year. Amazon is the only place I can find earphones like this anymore. I've been buying these Panasonic ones for 3 years now, and have noticed that the quality seems to be getting worse. The over the head part often comes twisted so that the pads don't lay flat against both ears, and/or the headband is so tight that it gives me a headache. I've figured out how to fix this: I heat up the top of the headband using my heat gun until it becomes pliable- but not melted and then quickly pop them on my head to cool off. This seems to fix the issue. I just opened my newest box and after fixing the head band, plugged them into my iPod to notice that the plug cord was touchy- cutting out the audio in one ear, or decreasing the overall quality in both ears when bumped. I'd expect this from a set a few month old- but not right from the box! Very disappointing. So now I have to order a new set....and have to make the choice- get panasonic again, or switch to a different, yet untested manufacturer?","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Earbuds hurt my ears, so I wanted a ""headband"" style pair that sat on the outside of my ears. I chose the Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port because of the price (<$5) and because there were so many great reviews. Normally, I shy away from super cheap deals because you usually get what you pay for (i.e., cheap deal = cheap product). Not so with these headphones. They are lightweight with a very decent sound, and are extremely comfortable. I had no problems wearing these on a 4 hour flight. My ears never hurt once, and I hardly noticed the headband. Plus, if I do every lose or break them, I won't be upset because of the price. But they seem very durable, and survived a round trip flight and being shoved in my backpack. They've already been used well more than $5 worth, so I feel like it's money well spent.

My kids are not very good about being able to keep ear-bud style headphone on, so I thought it might be better to have some on-the-ear style headphones. The headphones were a bit large for smaller heads, but they were able to sit back on the airplane seats and let the headphones rest on the seat. When they wanted to lean forward, the headphones would balance backwards and stay in position.

In general these worked great - reasonable loudness and clarity (for the price), lightweight, durable, and great price. Even the three year old liked them and that made the flight easier. I would note that they do not fold, but since I am giving these to the kids to use, they are more likely to break than get lost so I prefer more durability (non-folding). I would definitely buy them again if the need arises.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Many in the portable market consider Panasonic passe  but based on the sound of these headphones I'd say this company is more than holding its own. Though the headphones are light as a feather the clarity of this set brings out all the details for a good listening experience, no booming bass just good clean sound. I personally think headphones should act as headphones and not double as a music setting, let your player handle that part thus allowing the headphones to shine on their own.

Lochner","Durable, loud, work well with my iPhone","March 19, 2019","I love these headphones! My workplace loans out pairs of these for public use and was going to throw a pair out because the ear pads had torn off. I took them, cleaned them off, and used them till they gave out. I loved them so much that I bought myself another pair. They work fantastically, even without the ear pads. They get pretty loud, they give off audio as good as I'm used to (although I'm no audiophile), and the best part is they don't irritate my iPhone! I've had multiple pairs of earbuds that cause the music on my iPhone to pause and play randomly, and trigger Siri at random. It's incredibly annoying--but these headphones never do that! Couple that with how earbuds always fall out of my ears, and these quickly became my go-to listening device. I mostly kept my old pair in my bookbag and purse (two unforgiving locations to keep headphones), and they never seemed the worse for it. The wires finally gave out where each one connects to the earpieces, which I think was due to how at work we always brought the wire up and wrapped it around the earpieces. With how reliable my old pair proved to be, I gladly bought another pair!
One thing about these that could be a turnoff for some people: if you're listening to something loud enough, the people around you can probably hear it too. I've never minded this much (it's only when my music is really loud and it ups the chances of having a conversation with someone about the music I'm listening to), but if privacy or quietness is a concern for you then these might not be the right pair of headphones for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was blown away by these things. Frequency response of 16HZ to22KHZ, I believe it (We can only hear 20HZ to 20KHZ).
Crisp, no crackle highs, and no distorted lows.
With plenty of POWER! I use these for about 6 hours a day, 7 days a week. they are so comfortable that after the first day of use, i forget they are on, and nearly yank my laptop off of the table! Don't let the first fit fool you when you first put them on. They start out snug, but soon you can't feel them. GREAT SOUND low or high volume, and with all styles of music. From Classical, to Hip Hop, to the guitar gods of the classic rock era. (Rest in piece Ronnie Montrose), who passed on last week. I listened to Town Without Pity, and Rock Candy for hours with these. I think the next set will last much longer, because i do a ""headphone check"" before I get up from my computer. This is another marriage saving feature. You can hear your wife talk to you, and answer her intelligently, not like buds. I just ordered 2 more of them, for UNDER $10.00 delivered (2 day shipping for free. I love Amazon Prime)!
BUY THESE, AND GET AMAZON PRIME!!! The headphones lasted 6months , until my cat ate the wires. (Oh well, live & learn)...
This quality item for under $5.00 each can't be beat...
Amazon Prime paid for itself in about 4 months of 2 day shipping.
Not to mention that the Prime free video service(Free movie & tv shows streaming when you want them, similar to netflix)!
From music to movies, yummy!

Much surrounding sound is let in, and you can't crank them up enough to drown it out.  Probably a good thing for my ears.

OK for treadmill, bike, or rower, but impossible for strength training - they slip around if you are not upright.  (Edited to add that today, as I am still waiting for my next try at headphones for the gym to arrive, I discovered that if I push the headband back on my head, as opposed to straight up, they are much more stable.)

Headband a bit large for my head, even at smallest extension.  (On edit - barely the right size if I push them back a bit.  Anybody with a smaller head than mine would be out of luck.)

If you are going to be upright and not moving vigorously, they should be fine, and they sure are cheap!

On edit, raised my rating to four stars - they are quite amazing for the price, and comfortable now that I've discovered how to wear them.  Don't expect high volume, though.

On edit, including a link to another headset I ordered.  Am still deciding which one I like best for the gym.

I have had many headphones for years, from high-end Grados to mid- and low-end Sennheisers. Full- or compact-size and earbuds, you name it, I have owned them all.

This Panasonic RP-HT21 has a similar sound signature to Panasonic RP-HTX-7, a very fashionable pair that cost 6 times more. The sound stage is quite good and its bass response mimic what I hear from my Grados. The mid-range is as smooth, if not smoother, than Sennheiser's PX90/100/200. The one point deduction comes from the high-pitch sound, where it just broke apart. Other than that, it is hard to believe that a five-buck headphone can sound this decent.

If radio/TV use is your primary reason when selecting headphones, look no further.

If you want a casual music listen experience, this will be a serious content. IMHO, this has all Sennheisers (excluding earbuds) PX and HD series headphones beat (below 60-dollar range).

As long as its build quality (all cheap plastic mind you) holds up, this gotta be the king of all budget headphones when cost and sound quality are put into equation.

One minor note though, the all plastic headband snatches my hair when adjusting. I rarely get this kind of treatment from other cans.

In the end, you cannot lose buying this little guy and you could be pleasantly surprised as I have been.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These were as close as I could come to getting a pair like that, and I was glad I hunted them down when I heard how good the sound was.  There were countless cheap replacement headphones released by companies like Memorex which seem to have left a lasting impression that headphones of this size and shape didn't sound good.  This pair is a good example of how wrong that idea is.  Headphones today seem to only come in earbud or full sized ear enclosing cups, and that's a shame.  Headphones like these were popular during the era when people would jog with a portable cassette player, and I feel the size helps that application.  Larger cups seem heavier and strain my neck after hours of such use.  These have zero sound isolation, but that was part of the design.  Don't get these for a recording studio.

After some surfing I came across these budget pair of headphones which I selected with a goal to replacing my very poor helmet drop ins.  When worn as traditional headphone, they sound fair to good  but when they were under $13 it would be dumb to compare to my $300 plus headphones. A little thin but some discernible bass.  However, they have the features I need to use as drop ins i.e. an individual chord to each earpiece and a very simple attachment system. The earpieces can be detached from the headband in seconds by pushing the side arms outward and the soft earpieces can easily be removed with a little pressure as they are not glued and fit with elastic. As this point they can be inserted into my Bern helmet and the sound is really not too bad. it would be better if they sealed on your ear and some messing with the helmet chinstrap fixes this. They do however sound much much better than the relatively expensive drops ins that I bought with the helmet. Only downside is chord cannot be removed but at $13 total investment, I can live with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I bought these mainly for the good reviews + I wanted something light on my head for when I mow the lawn and listen to music on my iPod. I also have a beat up $8.00 KOSS UR/10 headphones I used for mowing the lawn, but the chord started coming apart from accidentally yanking it out of the iPod. The KOSS's sound was about the same as this Panasonic headset. I also have a more expensive headphone (Audio-technica ATH-M30), which I found out gets too hot on my head mowing the lawn. That now doesn't get used as much. To me, I think these cheaper headsets sound just as good as the Audio-tecnica over the whole ear headphone + your ears don't roast as much! For those of you that have a small head, these may be too big. My head is big and this set fits me just right. I didn't have to extend either side to fit over my ears. Actually, the bottom of each speaker fits exactly to the bottom of each of my earlobes.

You really didn't think you were going to get a quality set of headphones for 16 bucks, did you?  The biggest point of failure of wired headphones is to the connection between the wire and the speakers.  Even the most well-made units are not going to survive a cord snag or someone stepping on the cord.  Wireless headphones need constant recharging and pick up static during quiet moments.  So what's the solution?  A cheap pair of wired headphones.  Sure they're going to fail; probably faster than the expensive pair, but when they do you're only out a couple of bucks so who cares?  The trick with inexpensive headphones is to find a pair that has acceptable sound quality: Not great, just acceptable.  It's very possible to find cheap earbuds that meet this requirement.  Things start to get tricky when you graduate to over-ear units.  Unfortunately, the Panasonic RP-HT161-Ks miss the mark.  I can live with the higher frequencies which barely fall into the acceptable range.  Where these units fail are on the low end which is kind of weird.  Usually, the cheaper units provide muddy base and lack high-end response.  Sixteen bucks isn't a lot to pay for over the ear headphones but when you look at it from the standpoint that I'm probably never going to use them, it actually turns out to be fairly expensive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

What should one expect for headphones costing under six dollars? If your expectations are realistic, you will be pleasantly surprised with these. I was looking for a quick easy fix, and found it in these namebrand phones with prime shipping to my door in two days. I've used them for about a week. They are in fact very lightweight and comfortable. They fit firmly atop my ears (firmly enough not to slide or shake off requiring readjustment during normal use) and do not create any pressure points on the cartilage of my ear (3 to 5 hours average time per use). As to their sound quality (remember, six bucks) I'm quite pleased. I find the biggest difference is the source material, as much of what I'm listening to his web based – streaming music, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon prime video/music – and quality audio varies from clip to clip, let alone source. At six dollars, there was virtually no competition. Bargain bin, no name, knockoff earphones from Walmart, CVS, T.J. Maxx  (and the like) economy electronics' section are more expensive and hardly as reliable as Panasonic. Will I be lost in the experience as a blissful audiophile? NO WAY!

I grew up using partial over the ear but this style is difficult to find these days.  I use the headphones when exercising, during yard work, or fix-up projects around the house.  I wear an extra large male hat size.
My favorite is the Maxell SL-3, hp-200.  I like the way they feel as they are the most comfortable of the group.  The sound is well balanced throughout the frequency range.  The over the ear component aligns with the middle of each earpiece so the angle feels good.  One potential drawback is that the cord is a straight plug connector as opposed to the firm rubber right angle plugs that are more common.  I remember having many of these straight connectors that eventually went bad at the connection.

My second favorite is the Sonxtronic XDR-8000.  These have ends that go into the ear.  They are comfortable.  These are lacking in the base and low frequency range and require a higher volume setting to achieve the same sound as the padded Maxell and Panasonic headphones reviewed. The sound is a bit “tinny”. I am keeping these because while they don’t sound the best, they don’t have the foam pads and thus will hold up much better for those times when I am sweating heavily.

My third favorite is the Panasonic RP=HT21.  These headphones have the overall best sound and have a very full stereophonic sound.  They have the best bass and low frequency sound.  They have a very good 90 degree connector plug.  The cord is a great length.  The problem is that they are narrow and sized for a person with a smaller, narrower head than mine.  Furthermore, the over the head portion attaches to the earpiece at its front section.  This design causes the earpiece to flare away from the back of the ear and the sound suffers.  If you hold the earpieces to your ears with your hands the sound improves significantly.  In addition, this design results in a pinching effect that is very uncomfortable.  If the headpiece connected to the mid point of the earpiece I believe the problems would be solved and this would jump to the #1 favorite position.  At the price I am willing to keep them and see if they become more comfortable with time, but I am very doubtful.

Totally unacceptable is the Sony MDR-A17G.  Although they say Sony on the item, I doubt they are really made by Sony.  The earpiece quality is terrible and had extra plastic that scratches the ear.  The overall quality looks very cheap.  The sound is terrible, with a very tinny sound and no bass.  These will be returned.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've gone through almost a dozen pair over the past 3 or 4 years, and inevitably the wire (near where the plug connector is) will degrade inside the plastic sleeve, and suddenly one of the earpieces won't work. Your stereo music is suddenly mono.  You can wiggle the wire around a bit to make a temporary connection, but as soon as you let go you're back to mono.

So why do I give this 4 stars when it fails like that? Because every other headphone I've tried is worse. I haven't found a Bluetooth headphone that works without beeping between songs or other problems I won't bore you with. I haven't found an over-the-ear headphone that was ever comfortable for more than 10 minutes, which is because of the shape of my ears.  This on-the-ear set sits on the center of my ear comfortably because the earpads rotate; it has good sound for the period that it works; it doesn't block out other sounds around me which is what I want 90% of the time; and it's cheap enough so I can buy them half a dozen at a time and thus have a new pair ready when the last pair fails.

What I wanted was something small to use with my Chromebook in my lap that sounded Ok and wasn't blasting sound into the room.

These Panasonic, on ear, headphones meet most of my guidelines.  They are much lighter, the cord is shorter but I wish it was shorter still; a single cord from only 1 of the ears would be a bit more convenient and less tangle prone.  Each ear's speaker is much smaller too so I don't feel like it's bumping into my chair or pillow when I turn my head.  The sound is actually very good for listening to youtube and streaming shows.  I also appreciate it has a right angle plug so it doesn't stick straight out the side of my Chromebook risking a serious breakage; that's a nice touch.

I've only had these for about 30 minutes so I have no comments on reliability; if things go bad I'll update this review.  In the meantime, I'm a satisfied customer and I only spent about 5-10% of what my 'quality' phones cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

If you are a heavy user of headphones and really want to enjoy quality sound sound and comfort, I would go for a more expensive set, but for a occasional user such as myself, these will make you happy.

Don't get me wrong, the bass and treble is quite good, but there are not going to match up with the sound of quality of headphones such as my old but still good over the ear Sony headphones. I guess what I'm trying to say is for $7.95, these are a diamond in the rough.

So far no problems with anything.

I really like how it folds up and can get very compact and also the cord is not very long so it doesn't get tangled up. You would need to buy an extension cord if you wanted to sit in bed and watch TV with it though.

The sound quality seems great to me. The highs and midtones are very clear and come through well, but the bass is also full toned and strong. I listen to a lot of jazz and blues and these work great for them.

They don't seem to have much of a noise canceling quality, though that doesn't bother me as I can easily tune out background noises.

The build quality does seem a little cheap, but I haven't had any problems so far as others have. I've also dropped mine a few times and they've taken a couple of hard bumps and were fine, so maybe it's just luck of the draw with that.

The big negative though is comfort. I bought these thinking the ear pad was going to be pretty big and fit around my ears and they don't also, they aren't very soft. It starts making my ears sore after an hour or so. It might force me to get a new pair of headphones eventually.

The headphones themselves are comfortable and fit securely. The cord is why I rated this four and not five stars. One, it's short. It was clearly meant for portable devices only, as it reaches to my phone in my pocket with only a little slack to spare (I suppose I should have realized this before buying since it says right on the product description). Two, the plug does not fit securely into audio jacks. It's pretty easy to accidentally loosen to the point where it is still inside the jack but does not transmit audio. I bought this hoping to use it both for portable music and my desktop computer. I have only found it useful for the former.

UPDATE 27 DECEMBER 2016:

Okay. I've had this pair for a little while now. I still can't understand why the cord would be so short. I can barely use this thing. The only way I can use it without the jack repeatedly coming out of my phone is if it's in my shirt pocket, and I don't like to do that because my phone might fall out when I bend down. I definitely can't use it for my computer because my head would need to be too close. It's good for maybe watching a movie on your phone. I've changed my rating to 3 stars down from 4 because of this. It seems to be of good quality other than the cord, which is long enough for perhaps a child or infant.

UPDATE 17 JUNE 2017:

This pair's giving out. Right ear's coming in and out. Starting two months ago the plastic tabs holding each side to the frame started to break off, causing the adjustable parts to slide freely.

These are not the best sounding headphones, but for this price, they sound really good.  Prior to finding this model I have been buying the Koss KTX-Pro 1.  I liked the sound of the Koss but always found them lacking in bass and sometimes highs.  Worse of all, the Koss would always break because that stupid in-line volume control (what a bad idea) would always go bad.

So I needed something cheap to knock around while using my mp3 player when I'm out cycling or rollerskating.

I found these Panasonic headphones are was very impressed.  The bass on these is fantastic.  The highs are decent and the mids are good.  Don't buy these expecting the world, but you will get a good budget product.
I was so impressed that I bought three pairs.

I have found them to be very durable.  I have accidentally yanked on the cord so many times, the Koss would have been dead way sooner, but these Panasonics keep on going .  In just a day, I will have been using the same pair for two years and only recently did they start to get some signal loss due to loose wiring.

For affordable headphones, $5.99 at the time of this review, that is an impressive lifespan, especially as they were used on almost a daily basis and not always with the greatest care.

I did not want an expensive set of head phones, (they might ""walk away""), so this was a good buy. I figured I could go through 10 sets at $5 a set, and it would be worth it, even if each set didn't hold up very long - compared to having a $50 set for 1 week, then they disappear into thin air.

I've used the earbuds for awhile, (about 4 yrs) and they're OK, about $8 a set in the grocery store, sound quality decent, but they wear out after a few months (not surprising).  My only real complaint with the earbuds was every time I fixed them comfortably in my ears, someone would come up to me for something, and I'd have to take them out and then spend 5 minutes trying to get them comfortable again!

So I looked around for headphones, thinking at least I could just pop them on and off.

VERY SURPRISED!!!!!!! and pleased at how 1) comfortable; 2) excellent fit (usually after 3 months the headpiece has stretched out on every pair, cheap or expensive, I have ever owned, and they're too loose;  3) truly great sound quality and 4) durable.  I'm hard on everything.  They're still working fine.

Both speakers are working perfectly. True stereo.

I have very good hearing - I can hear someone using a stapler 3 work areas away with no trouble - that's why I need the headphones.

The sound quality on these little gems is so good, I can actually hear the singer sometimes pause and inhale before starting another line.  NEVER heard that with any headphones before.

I'm ordering 3 more sets for our home computers.

I really was blown away by the sound they provide, and how light and comfortable they are. Now I'm no audiophile, so I can't compare these to some super high end product, I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. So I'm speaking as a person who just like to listen to music and knows very little about the high end stuff. To me, as an ordinary listener, these are really great sounding, they are not noise cancelling so you can still hear stuff going on around you if you don't have the music turned up really high, which I like, but some people may not. I can't believe how little these cost and how great the sound seems to me, I was so happy with my purchase. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a good value, I'm very pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I already own the On Ear Model and can vouch for them being great for a few reasons, especially with some EQ modding.  I have assumed that the same 30mm drivers were used in both.  However, these headphones seem to be distinctly worse in several ways. I was expecting the same or better performance out of the box but got disappointment instead.  They are lightweight, but not quite comfortable.  The top bands seem designed to dig into the top of your head.  The ear pads are soft and comfy, but the real problem is the sound quality.  I got these as a backup set for several purposes, but I just could not stand the muffled quality to the sounds.  The main problem stems from the black fiber ""pad"" over the actual driver.  I cut these away with ease and the muffled quality went with them.  The circular bumps are the plastic casing over the drivers.  The pad is to stop liquid entry but the cost is to high for me.  Here is an EQ Mod that made them tolerable for me.  125Hz: +5, 250Hz: +1, 500Hz: 0, 1kHz : +1, 2kHz : +1, 4kHz : +3, 8kHz : +4, 16kHz: +4
YMMV.
You can hear A LOT of outside sound with these.  Only a little bit more isolation than the On Ears.
I still recommend the On Ear over this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I find ear-buds to be uncomfortable, and the sound to be of poor quality (no bass whatsoever and low quality high notes). The big ear-muff style headphones sound great, but I don't like how they look on me, nor do I like the fact that you can't hear any other noises (like someone trying to get your attention). They are also not really as good for wearing while doing something physical, such as jogging, and they are too big to be able to have them on while your head is sideways on a pillow or a chair, etc.

But this style of headphones is a nice compromise right in the middle.

In my experience for a couple months of frequent use of these headphones, with all kinds of music and audio, I have found them to sound very decent. Compared to other brands and models of this style of headphones that I have owned, these have a very decent amount of bass in them, significantly more so than my last pair, and the high notes also sound nice and clear. They fit well on my head too. For what they are, they do a very decent job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

My rating criteria is as follows. If the product works as is advertised and the quality is in line with the price then I give it five stars tentatively, then deduct stars for usability problems, functionality problems, flaws, quality, etc.

I've actually bought many pairs of these headphones for myself and others, and all have been of very high initial quality, and of good durability, with the price ranging up to $12 and back down to around $7.

Its hard to evaluate sound quality, and I have never had the desire or cash to spend more than $25 on headphones.  But for the price I have been very happy--I've never said to myself, ""I wish these were louder,"" or ""I wish these sounded different,"" or anything else like that.  I guess my thought is that if you know enough to critically evaluate a pair of headphones beyond those two questions, you probably wouldn't buy them on the Internet where you can't listen first.  I've bought a couple other pairs of sub-$10 headphones for my wife and kids, and these are the loudest, best and longest lasting, but they insist on earbud style so they haven't switched to these full time.

I don't like in-ear headphones because they tend to fall out of me ears, and eventually just get uncomfortable after an hour or so.  I guess I have a sensitive head, because I have quit using other headphones before because they squeeze too hard or the foam doesn't do its job.  These are comfortable enough for me that I can watch a movie on an airplane without discomfort.

For a decent pair of headphones, you won't go wrong here.  There may be better choices, but after listening to a couple other pairs that my family uses, if I needed a new pair of headphones I wouldn't even look at anything else.

As for durability, these have been very good for me.  I'm not a person who uses headphones multiple times per day, so I can't comment on how durable they are with constant, heavy use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

(wish I could have told you which model but it has worn of)
After listening to these on my laptop for a couple of hours I have to say that out of the box, the mid to high frequencies are boosted way too much for my liking (vocals and percussion stand out and overpower the bass). I have used the equalizer in winamp to reduce the harshness of the frequencies a bit and it sounds better.
That being said audio source has a big part to play, so i can't say how these will sound on a portable audio device with limited equalizer abilities.
Other things to note are that its kinda small(30mm driver), its very light, and cables are kinda thin.

Bottom line for 5 bucks....you would be hard pressed to find better

Though on lighter fare like pop music, the bass is surprising strong and pleasant. I'm not sure how the bass can be so wonderful, yet the overall fidelity sound like a tinny AM radio. I could probably use these for tasks or as a study aid, like for spoken language lessons, audio books, transcription, listening to lecture recordings - I guess anything but good music.

The sound isn't the best and the ear pieces don't swivel, so the way they fit your head is the way they fit with no adjustment other than the band at the top that lets you adjust the length like on most headsets.  I've always gotten good service out of Panasonic products, though, and expect no different from these.  They're decent headphones and I'd recommend them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Mushy Sound","October 31, 2009","These headphones are light, portable, fold up into a small package, and are relatively comfortable.  The price is very good if you need a pair of phones to go with your MP3 player and don't have a lot of extra cash.  I use them with my MP3 player when I'm flying or working out, i.e., situations where I'm not too concerned with the sound quality. They are very light and a little delicate so you have to handle with care.

The sound quality is just okay. They have ""extra bass boost"", which could also be called ""extra mushy"" or ""extra muddy"".  These are probably okay for certain genres of music like hip hop and rap, where the bass beat seems to be the whole point.  And they are fine for audio books or podcasts where sound fidelity is not crucial, but if you want to listen to music with any resemblance to the original source, these are not going to hack it. I have experimented with a multitude of EQ settings to even out the bass, and ""un mushify"" the sound, but it doesn't help much.  If you want lots of bass and aren't picky about the overall sound quality, these will work fine and are a good deal. If you want better than mediocre sound quality across the spectrum, you need to spend a few more bucks and keep looking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HT161-K-Lightweight-Long-Corded/product-reviews/B075LT8YLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These headphones exceeded my expectations.  I thought they would be broken within the first week.  They are still going strong after two months.  My son loves these headphones and they are a perfect fit for his little 3 year old head.  Since they are wired, my son does not throw these around like he did the previous pair.

There are things to note about this. First, they are compact, and could be good for travel (they don't leave my area, so I can't speak from experience). If you do use them this way, they are not something you could throw in with heavy things and forget. They do need to babied a little to not break - which might pose a problem for people traveling. Also, I have noted the ""shorting"" other reviews mention. I do not think this is a short.

However, the biggest issue (and the reason I plan on returning it) is the fact that I cannot plug it into my Samsung Galaxy Pro 8.4 with a hybrid / hard case. The plug molding is too big (and the right angle probably doesn't help either) and cannot plug all the way into the socket with the hybrid case. I have 2 different hybrid / hard cases, and this does not work with either of them.

I purchased these headphones primarily because I needed some cheap cans that would allow me to play video games and still hear what is going on around me in the real world. Xbox One now supports Windows Sonic, a surround-soundifier for headphones, and I wanted to take advantage of that. Figured these would be less isolating than my earbuds or over-ear Skullcandys, and the price was right. I didn't have much expectation beyond that.

TLDR version: These sound way better than I expected.

It has been a few years since I had a heaphone of this design, a lower-end ""came with your '90s Walkman or CD portable"" on-ear type. Both the very best and very worst I've owned were made by Sony, and if my aural memory serves, these are much closer to the good ones. Bass is not super-powerful but there's certainly enough low-end thump to make video games sound satisfying. From guns and explosions in Wolfenstein II, to thunder and horse-hoof beats in Oblivion, these are more than adequately bassy for a sense of realism. I can listen thru these quite happily without wishing for my larger and bassier Skullcandys. Upper-bass and lower mids are smooth and warm, never honky. Upper-mids and treble are airy, if a teensy bit over-emphasized. I don't mind that, as it makes dialogue and quiet passages in music easier to hear at low volume.

I've been mostly listening to electronic chill and ambient thru these, with a few classical tunes here-and-there. No complaints. Bass is, again, not mind-blowing, but just enough for low strings, low brass, drums, and various electronic bloops and bleeps. Stereo imaging is great, seeming to extend well beyond the boundaries of my head. I think this helps the illusion of 5.1 surround when listening to Windows Sonic. Rain in the game Oblivion sounds like it's really falling all around me, and the voices of various characters walking around the game all come from distinct points in space. Shows like Stargate Universe on DVD and Battlestar Galactica on Amazon Prime sound similarly spectacular. I would say the sense of surrounding space is more realistic with these than with my earbuds, and the fact that I can still hear my loved ones around me while listening is a great bonus.

I can't find too much fault with these. Hard rock and hip-hop might sound a bit thin and screechy through these headphones, especially when cranked to eleven. The plug might be too fat to fit through some phone cases, so use an extender or remove your case for portable listening. Build quality is not phenomenal, but as long as you're not stuffing them in a backpack or gym bag, and treating them like a grown adult should, they will last quite a while.

These would be great to wear while walking around a park, while shopping, or anywhere else where you want your tunes with you but still want to hear what's going on in the real world.
