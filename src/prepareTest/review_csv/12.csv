These ones are incredible. I used to buy 50-dollar Sennheiser for years, and was sure they were the best option on the market. Bought these Panasonics just as a temporary replacement for my old earphones and now use it as primary. Sound is crispy cleat, yet it has decent basses and is pretty good in the middle range. Even more so, when after two months of constant using these Panasonics, I forgot them at home and had to use my previous Sennheiser, I was shocked how superior Panasonics over Sennheisers were. No joke: Sennheiser is miserable in comparison to these headphones. Also, I used to thinking that Sennheiser were perfect for my pretty small ear canals; yet another mistake: these Panasonic earbuds lay in my ear so much better! Very comfy, they fit my ear awesomly so I don't even feel them. Nor do they fall out while moving actively. Also, a wide range of cool colors is a nice supplement to the earphones themselves.

Overall, I highly recommend these earphones. No clue why they are so cheap. They feel and sound like a $70-earphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

First pair sounded great but I lost them.  Subsequent pairs have been flimsy and falling apart after a few hours of use, so they are obviously knockoffs that third party Chinese sellers are allowed to sell on Amazon—WHY?  I bought Square Trade protection last time as recommended by Amazon.  However Square Trade says they will not honor my claim for manufacture defect since these earphones are supposedly protected by Panasonic with one year warranty.  And like others here, Panasonic customer no-Service was no help.  Square Trade is not worth paying for on small fragile items like this, because you probably won’t have this item for a whole year.  I am not buying or trusting this Panasonic product anymore!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I did not want to spend a lot but at the same time didn't want to have them broken after less then few months.

So I went to amazon and looked what the best seller and amazon's suggestions are. In the beginning I was very skeptical about panasonic earphones, not only because of a low price, but also because I never owned a pair of this brand. I whatsoever decided to order these to try them out.

I am amazed by the quality after having used them for half a year, they did not go bad at all. The sound quality is just fine, none of the strings broke, earbuds are soft and did not get lost or disconnected and it fits great with all of my devices. The only disadvantages are that since the strings are thin, they often get messy and that this set does not have a microphone. However, having that said, it is still an incredible quality price relationship.

I am fully satisfied with my choice and strongly recommend these for people with small budget for earphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I can't just have regular earphones, they never fit, always fall out, and of course the sound quality is just not there. I saw these and figured ""for the price I can't go wrong if they don't work as well"".
When I tried them on, the first thing I noticed was the ErgoFit design. I have never tried this type of earphone previously and I wasn't disappointed! Secondly, the sound quality was unbelievable! For the price you would expect the sound to be average, but these are crisp and clear and you can hear everything! I listen to Pandora at work and have started my Christmas music a bit earlier this year. I'm enjoying great stereo quality with great bass and treble with very inexpensive earphones. I keep these plugged into my work computer. I can't say anything about durability as I just purchased them. They also block out the sounds around me as I work in an office.

And here is why:
1. I have about 15 different headphones, some of them are very high end, and only reason I bought these was its size. I sleep on my side and play something until I fall a sleep or listen an audio book. When you turn to side to fall a sleep with earbuds in your ears, you need really small ones that doesn't protrude outside contours of ears. Otherwise pillow presses to earbuds into your ear canal and it hurts. So these earbuds are so small and excellty fit, you can turn to side and fall a sleep when they are in your ears.
2. They sound fantastic when compared to peers like Sony or Apple or many other unknown Chinese brands. Music is crystal clear, and detailed, great bass, incredible sound staging. For this price it is a steal. After listening this, you wouldn't put crappy apple earbuds again. As you can guess I use an iPhone as a source.
3. I would never expect noise isolation from these buds. But anatomically it seals to ear canal very well. Key is silicon seals attached to an oval opening instead of a circular one like many other earbuds. So it fits better. When you listen music with these earbuds, it seals surrounding noise so well, you can't hear a ringing office phone in front of you. I compare this the benchmark active noise canceling Bose QuiteComfort 35 Bluetooth headphones, and I own one. These little earbuds seals background noise nearly as good as Bose. Since they are very tiny and you can fall a sleep when these one in your ears. So this 8$ little earbuds are more convenient than 350$ Bose headphones. By all means Bose sounds better. Size always matters.
4. Price, only 8$ incredible for this kind of sound quality.
5. Durability is unknown, since I have been using only for a month. But they are perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The music is fun and enjoyable - Updated July 2016","July 2, 2015","Hey, it actually sounds good!  The music is fun and enjoyable.  The instruments sound real.  At times a bit thin.  Highs a bit bright but not thrill.  Not too much bass but if you fit the earbud deep enough in your ears, adequate bass is produced.  The music produced overall is exciting. Most likely you will shake with the beat of the music.  The sound is cheerful not dark like some of the more expensive ear buds.

I don't mind traveling with this little thing so that I don't risk losing the Ultimate Ears that costs 50 times more. (But does not sound 50 times better).

If you like heavy heavy bass.  This is not for you.

Update July 2016

I bought a new Audio-Technica ATH-CKR100 two weeks ago when I visited Nagoya.  It won the best product prize in Japan and it is highly recommended by the salesperson at the Big Camera.  I tested the earbud against Sony's XBA-A2 in the store for over an hour. before I bought it.  Unfortunately I did not have the panasonic 120 with me at the time.

When I compared ATH-CKR100 with the Panasonic RP-HJE120-K, I fund the sound of Panasonic  to be of high quality and more comfortable.  There is body to the voice and instruments like the more expensive earbuds.  It sounds smooth, comfortable and musical.  ATH-CKR100 produces better spacing between instruments but the treble is too bright.  It costs almost 40 times the price of Panasonic 120.  This is how good Panasonic 120 is.

Update

Recently I added Chord Mojo to my Fiio 5X.  The sound produced by this earbud is unbelievably unbelievably good.  The bass is deep, punchy and tight.  The voice is full bodied.  The music is really sweet, enjoyable and exciting.  I can't stop listening music through this earbud.  I am adding one more start to my rating.  This is a fantastic earbud!!  Wow!!!

Well done, Panasonic!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Then I lost them and decided to order another pair. This new pair has been absolutely unsatisfactory. They for some reason give my phone the impression that they are mic'd and that they are a wired speaker headset. Whenever I so much as shift, they pause the music or open up google voice, even when I disabled voice commands. It also will randomly switch songs and lower/raise the volume. They will also randomly cut out and start to play the music from the phone speakers. It happens not only when I'm listening to music but generally anytime my headphones are plugged in.

With that said I have tried ALL Kinds of phones in the 100$ range; so lets forget price for a moment;

These are by FAR The Best phones Under $10 I have ever tried;  They are pretty much the best I've tried Under 25$;
Once I get into discontinued phones selling for 30$ that used to sell for 70-$100;  these start to compare on that level.

as with all single driver phones these may begin showing on the mid to high tones; but these are still pretty tight on the midtones at higher levels;

they don't fall out of my ear;  hold in the sound from background noise when inserted correctly and using the proper ear pieces given;

Are pretty lightweight as well.

CONS:  packaging is the old 'blister style' pain in the butt to open;  need a razor or strong scissors;  They are Not Tangle Free;

Maybe I should give three stars since they are so cheap but decided two stars since they are so cheap.

Someone suggested reports of poor bass may be due to user failure to insert them properly.  Sorry, no, tonal balance is simply very light.  Some listeners may mistake sibilance for good detail - just depends to what one is accustomed.  They work, you can hear music with them and they're seven bucks at this time, the latter being their strong point.  However, they aren't the worst I've heard, just the most affordable.

Let's break it down

I found myself searching an earphone that exceeds my previous cheap earphones which cost around $6 then I found this and here is what I expereince.

1. Price
By the the time I purchased it, which was April, I bought it at $9.75, and since I am in outside the US, on a teritory, shipping fee is a norm when buying. Suprisingly it is free shipping. From the $6 amount to $9.75, It is worth the jump, and wish to buy it while it is still cheap.

2.Audio Quality
If you are looking for a clear, low bass, and stable sound for the ears then this is the one for you. Just need to find the right volume from your phone and Its all good.

3. Fit, comfortability and durability
Have you ever seen the earphone of s8, that is like the design of this one but a little smaller. Fits the ear perfectly fine. the item is light, the cord is flexible but not tangle proof. It is not actually sound proof unless you boost the volume near its max. I still use it till now and looking forward to last even longer than my previous earphones.

3. Function
Can listen to audio, obviously. You can have an option of either w/ mic or not. even w/o the mic you xan use it for calls but speak through you external mic and such. Not waterproof as well, so don't soak it.

Overall a well rounded Earphone, worth to buy.

For the same reason, I was not able to use them as hands-free headphones for my cell phone.  Maybe it is just me, but I have never been able to talk with something plugging my ears.  There goes my Secret Service career.
What I do use these for mostly is as a headset for my PS4 where they plug into the controller and work great for game sound.  Again, if I am playing with other people that I am talking to, I switch to my older ""Gaming"" over-the-ear headset.  For Netflix they are also pretty good with good sound for both dialog and sound effects.  But, the other thing that drives me crazy with these sealing in-ears is that every time you touch the wires, you hear it.  Taping, scraping, sliding, popping. I find that when I am reclining back the wires rub on my collar from the motion of my breathing and I feel like I am watching TV with Darth Vader.  I feel like I AM Darth Vader.  If I run the wires back over the top of my ears it mostly eliminates this problem but that only works when I am sitting still as if I move around they do not stay behind my ears. Part of the problem with having them routed over my ears is that the wired are a little on the short side to begin with.  3' 9"" to be exact.  Enough for most uses, but not a lot to spare for creative routing of the wires.  Speaking of the wires they are very thin, which may affect durability, but so far they are fine.
After all the negative comments you might be surprised at the 4 stars but for the price they sound very good and are comfortable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I own decently high end stuff: AKG Q701, NAD Viso HP50, ATH-M50x, Beyerdynamic DT770, and so on... I've got a lot... and they're all really quality.

But I like to go to sleep with in-ears.  These are the most comfortable in-ears I own.  The size and the fit are perfect (I know that won't be the case for every single one of you).  I do own nicer in-ears (one's that sound a lil better).
But to wear the nicer one... I'm afraid I'll break it during the night while I'm rolling around in my bed.  The Panasonics have lasted for over a year.  Let's see how much longer they can survive under rough use.  But even if they break... I'll gladly spend $7 for another pair.

NOTE: I've bought these as gifts... especially for kids.  Parents love it.  They use it for their portable devices and since they're inexpensive... not much to worry about.

I've named most of my other reviews in silly ways.  So I will with this as well.

The earbuds are surprisingly comfortable, and produce a fantastic sound even when the volume is low. They drown out background sounds extremely well, even when i just have the buds in with no sound coming through (my office can get NOISY, and sometimes its nice to mute it out, without having to counter it with more sound). The cord is the common plastic cord (nothing braided, wrapped, or fancy as with some other earbuds) so i will be cautious when handling to reduce the occurance of accidental cord pinching! Although the design seems a bit odd at first glance, the fit is actually PERFECT! Seriously, its perfect, and I have had no issues with them falling out as im putting around with them in. It also came with 2 other sizes of silicone caps for the earbuds if the first ones arent a match for everyone else. The color is fun  and keeps them from getting lost in the sea of black and white cords..so many cords....It comes with a built in mic (a personal must-have) and from what ive tested so far, it picks up sounds with crystal clear clarity.

They’re comfortable unlike Apple headphones that are just a hard piece of plastic in your ear canal, and they have amazing sound quality/bass. They’re also noise cancelling, which is a huge bonus! They’re on the cheap side as far as headphones goes, so I wouldn’t be upset about buying a new pair every other year once they start to deteriorate. The problem is that the time it takes to deteriorate has greatly decreased since I bought my very first pair years ago. This is my THIRD pair in the past year!!! My most recent pair I bought at the end of February and they broke in late May (literally sound won’t come out of the right bud at all and the left bud you have to turn the volume up to max to hear literally anything). I’m debating ordering one more pair to try and give it another shot, since they’re an amazing pair of headphones when they work, but don’t know if it’s worth it the chance of the product being defective again. I know it’s only $10, but collectively I’ve spent now $30 on these headphones in the past year - it adds up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

When they do though, you're forced to the budget market. Now, I don't like IEM's, but these deliver. Especially for the price.

Now, the quality of the build isn't anything particularly satisfying to feel or look at, but I'm someone who fiddles with things. I've become accustomed to swinging the earbuds, and despite the several times I've smacked these on the ground  or even stepped on these, they refuse to break.

A big problem I have with IEM's are comfort. I find sticking something in my ear really kind of gross. You could imagine that the design of these would be an instant turn off, as they're designed to literally go into your ear canal. Didn't matter. I used the smallest size pads and stuck them in. For 30 minutes I could have them in and feel no discomfort, which is crazy for IEM's. I'm happy with the comfort of these for what they are, but don't expect to want to have them on for over an hour.

I've tried to divide this into sections of build, comfort, features and sound, but these really don't have any features. Regularly this would be a degradation, but they don't need to. They don't have multimedia controls, which was a bit saddening, but the sound quality makes up for that.

Now, the sound quality is what really surprised me. The Panasonics are bass-heavy, and they're not very refined. However, it's not overbearing or boomy, which makes me okay with it. The bass is enjoyable. It can excite you. The mids are definitely the mid-range and low-mid range is really where these things shined. The clarity and separation still surprise me at times, and in a good way. The highs are rolled-off a little too soon for my liking, but they aren't sibilant, and they're audible. The audio is enjoyable at all frequencies. Another things that surprised me about the audio was the soundstage, which was surprisingly large for something literally inside of your head. Larger than the M50x's at least, and some low-end Bose headphones. Definitely worth the 10 dollars just for that. The imaging is lackluster, but they can't all be winners. It's just not immersive enough. Then again, I'm using these on the go for school and the bus. I can imagine people talking literally inches away from my ears would make for a rather grounding experience. Noise cancellation is solid. Not much to say there. Passive; it's good. Isolation really surprised me though. Using it in a classroom I can have my music cranked up to max, too loud for my ears, and no one could possibly hear me. Great.

Worth ten bucks. Worth 25. Arguably worth 40-50. Buy them if you need them, and you wont be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have owned a pair of the 120s for years and have tried various other highly rated earbuds but kept going back to the 120s. Why? Because they stay in my freaking ears. In a static state, these other higher quality earbuds are pleasant, but even a head turn with a light cord tug will cause others to dislodge from my ear cavity.

I keep trying different companies and eventually come back to these. I use my earbuds all the time, literally every day. I throw them in my pocket and carry them with me everywhere. So basically what comes in the box is pretty standard for earbuds, the earbuds themselves, there are three different size ear bud ends, and some paperwork.

Pros:
-great sound
-fit well in ears
-stylish
-comfortable

Cons:
-don't last very long. (Mine lasted on average about 3 months, however, for $6 it's unbeatable)

Let's go over the earbuds in more detail now.

Packaging
The packaging was nothing special, just a standard plastic case. The ones that are a pain in the ass to open. It took me about 2 minutes just to open the box. However, it's not the box, but what's in the box that matters.

Build Quality
Build quality wise, these earbuds seemed ok, the wire was fairly thin but unless you where pulling on it, it doesn't seem like the wire would give way. The 2 earpieces themselves are made of plastic, once again, it doesn't seem that the plastic would break unless you abuse the crap out of these earbuds. As for the headphone jack, I like how instead of having it go straight it turns, so if you rest your phone on the jack, it won't wear off the wire joint.

Comfort
These earbuds are quite comfortable, I wore them for about 5 hours straigh before I started feeling pain on the inside of my ears. I also like how well they actually fit in your ears, they don't feel like they're hanging out of you ears, they feel like they are in your ears. So if you wanted to go for a jog with these earbuds, I don't think it would be a problem.

Sound
The sound is very good. It isn't going to blow your mind, but they do sound very good for the price. I use them for listening to music all the time and I enjoy every second of it.

Summary
In the end, I would recommend these to anyone. They are good earbuds. I have purchased these earbuds 3 times now, and I will probably be back again soon.

These sound good and fit well, always stay in place. But what impresses me most is the build quality, so to speak. As a daily motorcycle rider I have stuffed numerous ear buds under my full face helmets for years. Cords break, the earbud itself will come apart, the small plastic bud covers detach inside the ears. But these? I ordered two pair last year and lost one pair a few months after. I've been using one pair only for the last several months and they are still going strong with the sound, and the materials used in making them have not been compromised. The cord is all together, the buds intact. They have been yanked, pushed, stepped on, and tied around my phone daily. They have been indestructible. I have worn much more expensive buds in the past and one thing or another has failed so far as materials and build. But these? Well, I just ordered another pair to replace the black ones lost because I use them at work and the cord blends with my black uniform and gear.

I use headphones all the time.  I listen to music on my phone daily and also use a set plugged into a bluetooth intercom system on a motorcycle.  The latter has speakers, but I prefer using earbuds as they block out the background wind noise which help protect hearing at the same time allowing me to listen to music, make calls, talk to other riders and hear GPS instructions while I ride.

For my purpose, these headphones have been great.  Better sound than any other headphones I have tried in the <$20 price range and good at blocking out background wind noise while I'm riding (with a full face or MX/goggles helmet on).  The relatively low profile allows me to put on my helmet without the earbuds popping out of place and they also stay in securely while running, cycling, etc.  While this will depend on the individual ear, these headphones come with three different sized ear inserts, that are well made and fit securely to the base.

Like with ANY earbud, fitment is key both to sound quality and comfort, so your bound to get a range of reviews.  ""Easy Tiger"", does a great job of going into detail about proper fitment, so read his review if you are struggling to get good sound out of these.  I'm very happy with the sound, but my expectations are also reasonable considering the fact that these are earbuds, not a $200 pair of over the ear headphones.  I've have owned more expensive earbuds, but from my recollection (not a side by side comparison), any improvement in quality of sound is marginal.

At this point, my one gripe is that the insulation on the jack is to thick for my phone case making it pop out and loose the connection.  To remedy this, I carefully trimmed the insulation back about 1mm around the entire jack using a utility knife which solved the problem.  There is no concern about cutting the wire by doing this as that portion of the jack is still metal.  Whether or not that will weaken the connection of the wires to the jack remains to be seen.  I will update if I have any troubles.  Another option is to just make the case headphone cutout larger, but I have three headphones and one one case, so I went this route.

I bought three of these and will by three more when the time comes.  For my use, these are the best earbuds for the money that I have tried to date.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I own several pairs of headphones and earphones. When I first put these on and listened, I was unimpressed. But I misjudged them, because after comparing them back to back with my Sony MDRXB40AP, I found that the treble on the Sony was actually a bit too much, almost harsh, because when I put the Panasonic back on, listening to the treble was like my ears were on soft comfy pillows. The mid range was more present on the Panasonic than on the Sony, and the bass was good, however the Sony beat the Panasonic in that category. But honestly, it should, since the Sony was about 6x more expensive, and it is literally called ""Extra Bass."" The clarity and definition was also better on the Sony, but again, I would expect it to be for the price. All in all, the sound you're getting is nothing to sneeze at, and for about $6-$7, you really can't get a better deal. These are worth it for the unique driver chamber and nozzle design alone. They really are an ergonomic fit. So, If you really don't have money to spend, get these. And even if you have better earphones, but just wanna compare, these are a fun buy. And they come in great colors! I'm glad I got mine in red.

No regrets","January 5, 2018","Durability 5/5: Bought these almost 4 years ago and they have lasted me extremely well. I had a pair of Samsung earbuds that came with my phone about 3 years ago and they eventually died about 2 1/2 years after regular usage. These earbuds, however, are very hardy and durable. I wrap them up a little too tightly, I admit, and there is absolutely no sign of wear and tear on the cord. The in-ear part is also very sturdy, taking a reasonable amount of jostling, and so far so good.
Model 3/5: It did take a LOT of getting used going from the old, traditional earbuds to the in-ear style. I have terrible sinuses and so I will never truly get over how they suction into your ear (and when they get ripped out after having a good suction...AWFUL!!). Because of the in-ear, suctiony-ness, you will also get cord noise. As in, every time that you touch the cord or it rubs up against something, it will be very obvious and amplified. this is unpleasant until you get used to ignoring it.  All of these things seem less about quality, and more just about getting used to this kind of earbud.
Sound 5/5: I'm not an audiophile by any means, but these earbuds have a really strong bass kick! Quite good sound for the price!!! Not tinny at all, not muted at all, not scratchy at all. I'm VERY impressed with the audio that these cheap little things can push out!
---Edit: Compared to higher end over-the-head headphones, I can tell that the bass is definitely boosted and the mids to highs are diminished. However, the overall sound is still clear. It's crystal clear sound, but with heavy base and the absence of some higher tones. You won't notice that the highs and some mids are missing unless you're listening to stuff with heavier emphasis on those registers. But if you're really into strong bass, these will definitely do the job.
Comfort 4/5: Once you get used to the in-ear aspect, these are actual pretty comfortable. I ended up taking the rubber ends off and putting on different ones that fit into my ear better. However, the actual shape of the earbud, being slightly angled, allows it to rest in the ear quite comfortably. Just don't lay on your side with your ear squished into the pillow or that will be uncomfortable really fast.
Overall: 5/5. I won't take off stars for my discomfort due to going inside the ear canal and then suctioning there because that is just how this kind of earbud works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have never seen such a dumb design - it is literally making a square peg fit into a round hole. Thankfully, the round hole on the phone case is somewhat pliable. However, the square peg comes out too easily from the round hole, thus, only three stars. The sound is still great and the buds stay in my ear just fine. But that does not help when the square peg on the other end pops out of the round hole in my case. Very disappointing.

ORIGINAL REVIEW, written for an older pair of earbuds than the ones I bought 5-6 weeks ago: To my great surprise, I love these earbuds!  They are even more comfortable than the Apple ones I have replaced a couple of times at $30 each time.  I was concerned that they would plug up my ears to make the pressure painful - I have had some of those over the years - but these do not.  I can also hear what is going on around me when I wear these, which is a plus if I am out walking and listening to music.  Sound is great, fit is perfect, both of which are the most important to me, as they probably are to all who buy earbuds.  Highly recommended.

Only con: if I watch a movie or listen to music in bed and fall asleep with these in my ears, they are not comfortable to sleep with; they feel lumpy and bothersome when I sleep on my side.  Thus, I use my old Apple ones (which are down to only one plug since the other one stopped working) if I want to listen to a movie or music in bed since the Apple ones are ""flatter"" against my ears.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was looking for a replacement headphone set due to my original with the phone, Samsung one, started failing on the right ear.

I was searching through tons of  listings here on Amazon only and then had to narrow my search by going through only '4 stars and up' rated products.  I then went through those filtered products that had more than 50 reviews because this usually means that 'hopefully' enough people have tried them and verified their function or quality.  Mind you, I know if a product has too many all 5 star reviews, that more than likely there are many fake reviews within them.  I do go through the bad reviews too, just to get a feel of the flaws or weak points on the product.  Especially on electronic items. If there are too many people pointing out the same weakness, I will weigh it out... 'is it something I can modify or fix?'.  I have modified many products... sometimes all it takes is using a better glue or a sealing adhesive.

Ok, so all that put aside... I do like these.  The only downfall is that I  was expecting a Mic & Volume control on the wire itself, like my old one.  My oversight, so I can't penalize the product for my lack of verifying those options.  These are available with a Mic (no volume on either model), but I must've rushed through with my order, so be sure you select the correct one. They also come with different sized silicone buds that can easily be changed due to your particular ear canal size.  I believe they come with the medium sized ones installed, and then come with a larger and smaller pair.  Can't beat that.

  The over all quality? Not great, but for the cost and how light they are, I think they're worth it as of now.  The wire is very thin, so you must take care on how you handle it or store it.  Don't just stuff it in a pocket or wrap it around a device too tight.  I use a little pouch (like those for coin change or maybe rosary beads).  This keeps the lint out of the ear pieces and less tangling (I loosely wrap the headphones around 3 fingers and stick it in the pouch; rarely are they tangled).

  I tried using them for sleeping with music or falling asleep while watching videos on my phone.  They are NOT comfortable if sleeping on your side or on your belly (where your ear is on the pillow).  They're great if you can lay on your back though, hardly feel them.  Unfortunately, I can't sleep like that...lol

  At this point, I'd purchase these again if these were to fail at least 6 months from now.  I do use earbuds often enough.  Maybe not daily, but I do use them for exercise (jogs or runs) or while working to block out noise,  like weed whacking or mowing.

  I bought this from the seller ""Amazon.com LLC"", which I feel is important to list this info. I've come across sellers with variances in their items, including knockoffs, even if listed as same brand. I'll post an update with a durability review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

From the box the sound quality was crisp, level, full, and even. For cheap earbuds, the sound quality is quite the opposite of cheap. Sound does not pop out and the bass doesn’t suffer even at full volume. Had my first pair of these for three years, went for a 2-3 mile run or worked out wearing these several times a month. They got sweat and water on them but never gave out. EVEN ACCIDENTALLY WASHED THEM IN THE WASHER ONCE AND THEY WORKED FINE AFTERWARDS! About a week ago my left earbud started popping on and off with different vibrations. For three years of almost daily use definitely worth the price. Highly recommend. After my first pair went out I went to Walmart to see if I could purchase decent earbuds to replace or at least hold me over until I order another pair of these. The sound quality was noticeably not as smooth and full on the Walmart pair (for the same price as these) they also would pop and crackle under heavy volume, and one side was slightly louder then the other. Returned those the next day and ordered my second pair of these, out of the box: same excellent quality.

One good feature is the L shaped headphone jack with a small housing so it fits into narrow phone case openings.  They have multiple sizes of earbud covers to fit different size ear canals.
 The bad things:  They have no noise cancelation at all.  The sound is just ok.  My biggest issue is that the wires are extremely flimsy.  There actually may be a short in it and I only just opened the package.  When the plug turns in the jack, there is a ton of crackling.

Bottom line, if you're a music listener you won't be the least bit happy. No bass, no treble, lots of guitar. Listening to something like John Scofield all I hear is John's guitar and not in a very musical way. With podcasts that are primarily just voiced based - think NPR, etc. - they're acceptable.

For the price, the sound quality was great and the mid-wire button is a big convenience. Unfortunately, had an accident and ended up breaking the wire and that pair was lost.

The trouble began when I ordered a replacement pair after ruining my first pair. The first replacement pair arrived and immediately out of the box the sound was cutting in and out before quickly stopping entirely in one ear. Additionally, the button didn’t work at all and I narrowed the problem to the strain relief as I could cause some variation by getting it to just the right spots. I decided to return the pair for a replacement.

Second pair arrived and worked well initially but then I quickly encountered very similar issues. Not to the same degree as the first, but I’ve noticed the strain relief is quite touchy on this pair too. It’s degraded to the point that if it so much as gets bumped, sound will cut out in one or both ears.

It’s very unfortunate as the first pair I had was great and I was and am quite happy with the sound quality when it’s working. My guess is that the way it’s packaged forces the wire/relief to bend in a way that causes damage to the wires internally but I don’t know for sure. Either way it’s an unfortunate decline in quality and I won’t order these headphones again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

it's been frustrating and strange too...why dont ANY ear buds work for me? everywhere you go it seems so many people have  one earbud hanging out there ear all easy breezy like it's no big thing. I mean, are my ears shaped weird? do I not understand how to insert an earbud? is it really that complicated?  then I thought it was because my ears were small but even if I used the smallest size cover, it never stayed in. I kinda just gave up and moved on to head phones but they can be bulky and heavy, which is a whole other story.... I tried expensive ones too thinking maybe I was getting shoddy products being too economical....anyhow, I wasn't expecting much from these based on my past experiences with all the others.
so, you can imagine how VERY happily stunned I was when I opened these and saw the very differently positioned ear bud. I was immediately hopeful. then, when I inserted into my ear i could feel the instant comfort and ""click"", if you will. it just fit so well! I think I audibly gasped in shock and awe. maybe this sounds a bit dramatic but it has been at least a decade of trying out many, many different earbuds, so hopefully, you can understand my joy. I have not gone to the gym yet with them so once I do i may report back on how it went. but I've used them in my car and was able to hear perfect and command my phone and took a phone call to which the person on the other end said it sounded loud and clear with not a lot of background noise.  suffice it to say, so far I am quite happy with these and will absolutely buy more pairs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have been using these since 2014, and I have never gone back. I always have to have a pair with me. If they break, which is always my fault, the first thing I do is order these, and I buy another brand in the store to use while I wait for these to arrive.

I've tried Skullcandy earphones, Samsung Earphones, Sony Earphones, etc-- which are all under the $25 range, and these cheap Pansonic Earphones always lasts longer, can withstand more, and sound better. Other earphones under $25 usually break when I sleep with them on, crush them in my pant's pocket, or get damaged the first time they're thrown into the laundry washer. Some even get messed up when you workout and sweat on them.

These earphones will last you a long time. They're pretty durable, and that's why I keep going back. That, and the sound exceeds expectations of what you'd expect for cheap earphones. The bass hits your eardrums just right, the way it fits into your ear cancels out the outside noise... I love these earphones.

As I said, I've been using this since 2014. Never once have I received a defective one. And every time I had to order a new one, it was always my fault. They never broke just because. I'd be the third or fourth time it got put in the washer, and it'd finally give out. I expect that. Panasonic, if you want to give me 20 free pairs of earphones, holler at me.

Also, know that I use my earphones heavily. I use it whenever I go shopping, walk to class, go to the gym, wait in line, eat by myself, walk by myself, study, and so on. I am a heavy earphone user, and I vouch for these.

I bought another pair and it only lasted a few months before the exact same thing happened. I think they must be using less glue or something because the microphone ones are much less sturdy.

It's frankly silly how well these things hold up--I've had a pair for FIVE YEARS, wearing them while in the gym, while roofing in the burning sun, while repairing maple lines in the freezing cold, while singing in the rain. I've used them all-day while tending the fire in a steam-filled maple boiler shack. I've run them through the washing machine God knows how many times. I once accidentally shut them in the door of my truck and dragged them through snow-covered, salt-treated roads for four miles. I've given them a holy water bath to exorcise the immortal demon which I suspect gives them their power. I've dropped them in mud. I've snagged them on a hundred corners. They live. The adhesive holding the buds together gave out once, but with just a dab of Gorilla Glue, they rose again. I don't know what they're made of or why they're so much more durable than any other pair of $5-$10 buds you might buy, but they absolutely refuse to quit.

The cost vs. sound price is just right. Are there better sounding headphones on the market? Of course, and if top of the line sound quality is the most important thing to you then you should get another set of ear phones. Having said that, in order to upgrade you will pay for high quality. In this reviewers opinion these headphones beat other manufacturers that are charging four times this for the same quality.

 One word of caution. You have to get the headphone all the way in your ear, or your listening experience will have a overly treble sound to it. In order to get the bass you have to get it all the way in.

I needed a new set because my Bose were getting kinda worn out (actual wires were beginning to show through the rubber outside cover) and I didn't want to shell out $120 bucks again (even though they lasted 3 years).  I looked for the best cheapest ones and came across these.  Not disappointed.  If your looking for strong bass, these are the wrong headphones for you.  However, if you are looking for balanced, clean, crisp sound with a good bass ""punch"", then these are for you.  While not as comfortable as my Bose, for the money they are well worth it.  Don't get me wrong, they're not painful to wear after long periods of time and they do not get annoying, but they are not like the Bose where you wondered if they were in your ear or not.  If you experience a ""tin"" sound, push them in further and make adjustments to your equalizer before you get mad and send them back. I will update my review as time goes on.

After reading the many great reviews on here, I decided to give these headphones a try, since I was traveling and wanted something simple.
I tried to like these earphones. I even tried the various sized rubber inserts. I adjusted the volume on the various devices I used it on. Overall despite the brand name, these sound like $2 headphones from China. The issues I had were:
1. I had to really crank up the volume to get any kind of decent sound. The drivers just aren't very sensitive.
2. Too much midrange and not enough highs and lows. My guess is that the design of these headphones forces sound through a tiny hole that get routed into the ear canal.  Sound that have the resonant wavelength for this size hole would be amplified, while highs and lows would be attenuated.
3. The rubber inserts were uncomfortable.  The design forces the inserts deep inside your ear canal.  This makes the inside of your ears itch, so I don't think I can wear these for hours on end. I would prefer the older foam style that fits on the outside of your ear canal.
4. Audio just sound faint and distant. I never get the feeling that I am right in the action.

In conclusion. These are not Sennheiser so don't expect quality. They remind me of some JVC headphones I got once on an impulse buy because they were cheap. I have owned many fine Panasonic products so I was initially quite surprised at the low quality (In contrast, my 10 year old 720p Panasonic TV still looks better than most newer TVs). The only use I can imagine for these headphones is if you want something to fall asleep to, like comedy or talk radio but not music, and don't want to risk breaking good headphones (due to finding them under you the next morning) then these might suffice. I have broken many good headphones this way, so I won't mind when these Panasonics headphones break. (I got the white ones, in case it makes any difference)

update: I have had this for 5 months now. I use it almost every day for video editing (mostly voice, sometimes intro music) and falling sleep to internet radio. It has started to grow on me. (maybe I have forgotten what good headphones sound like). I rate the sound quality to be adequate to good. I haven't really intentionally abusing it -- just use it normally. Sometimes I find it crushed under me,  between me and the bed in the morning. So far it has been quite sturdy. So upping to 4 stars from original 2. The one thing that I still do not like is that it goes deeper into the ear than traditionally earbuds. So sometimes my inner ears gets itchy after prolong use. Also, it blocks out more sound that traditional earbuds, due to the compressible rubber inserts, which are quite soft and generally pretty comfortable. This seems by design for noise isolation purposes. So sometimes I have to remove the headphones to have a conversation, or to check to see if the phone is really ringing. Knocking one star for these quirks. Otherwise pretty good headphones for the price.
Will update again if/when it breaks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

> Sound quality of the Panasonic buds great right out of the box.  In comparison, similar JBud2 buds were muddy for the first 20 hours of use.
> Oddly, you can hear the sounds of  the wires of the JBud2s being tapped, quite loudly, MUCH more so than with the Panasonic Ergo Fits.  Normally this isn't a problem, but could be with repetitive exercise.
> The Panasonic cushions are 1/2 size smaller than the JBud2 cushions.  The medium Panasonic cushions are perfect for me.  The medium JBuds are a little large for me.  (The secret to comfort is to use the smallest cushions which work for you).  You might be most comfortable with larger or smaller cushions.  Suggestion, keep earbuds which fit your ears (even when a headset fails and needs to be discarded).  You can install your old cushions on your new headsets
> For me, even with the same cushions the JBud2 earbuds feel as though they seal better, providing slightly greater noise isolation---but that might vary from person to person with slightly different shaped ear canals.

They sound good, they fit good and stay in when I'm running. They lasted a year and a half, and if I can find where my 9yo left them I'm sure they will still work. So sad they have gone missing that I've just ordered another pair and a pair in green. I've bought several other pairs of these that I've given to my kids. Best part is they can survive in the bottom of my purse and still work, but hey if something happens they were ONLY $9. So it doesn't really matter if I find a pair in my son's pocket after I've washed them (sigh, never fails, I think I've checked every pocket except apparently the ones with the earbuds). If you're looking for a decent pair of earbuds that are pretty durable and affordable then look no further! Do they compare to the sound of Beats or something, probably not, but I'm not looking for that because then it would stink if something happened to them and I'd never let them sink in a tangled mess to the bottom of my bag :) I did have a purple pair of these that the sound went low on one side, which I hate, however I had them for awhile and they were mostly used by my kids so the greatest care of them was not taken and would honestly say the problem came from handling or just time rather than product defect. Again, I think I got the purple ones for $8.43 with Prime so not a big deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They lasted a couple of years and then I lost them.  I bought another pair without the mic.  My daughter has two sets.  The one thing you can say is the audio quality is always excellent.  I cannot believe the sound for such a small investment.  I love base, and the base comes through so nicely, but not in an unbalanced way.

On my original set, I did notice over time that the mic quality decreased.  So far, with this set, the mic is excellent.  When I plug this into my iPhone 7 (needs a little adapter which I have), my audio quality is much better than just talking on the phone itself, according to the other party.  Every time.  If your friends ever tell you that you are sounding muffly, buy these ear buds (or go Bluetooth but I like having it plugged in so I don't have to constantly recharge them).  You will sound so much better to the other party, plus you get some serious sound quality.

Don't expect them to last more than 6 months or so, but I lose things often enough or ruin them by my own accord that I never want to spend more than 10 bucks. I'll get to the airport cursing my inevitable forgotten item, and then have bought these same headphones for triple the price at Hudson News.

They come with three sizes of squishy bits for inside your noggin. I tend to use the biggest and find switching the bits very easy. Makes it nice for cleaning too.

When these headphones do go, it is rarely the jack that is the problem. 6 out of 7 times it's been one earpiece losing volume by about 50% making everything uneven. Still, five stars for the price.

I have tried a number of different sets that have been in the $30 and below range and so far my favorite have been the Creative EP-630's. I'm not sure why, but I always passed these up when looking for new ones to try, but based on the overwhelming positive reviews and the low cost I decided to give them a shot. I'm glad I did because to my ears these sound as good or close to those EP-630's. I probably need to compare the two more but I'm thrilled in just the fact that I can even say that much.
The bass sounds great, it's deep with not much distortion and the mid and higher ranges sound good as well. I found the fit to be good and comfortable as well, bearing in mind that I do most of my music listening while lounging and not while doing some physical activities, but I would surely think they would stay in and work well for that too.

So i bought one of these maybe a year ago and it was by far the best pair of earbuds ive bought but unfortunately lost it so i decided to get another one. Before doing so, I read the reviews down here and was like: What are the chances i receive the defective version? Also i wasnt rly sure if i shouldve trusted the reviews or not so i decided to take a gamble and order another pair. Then just about a month after light use (maybe even less than once a week or so) it completely broke on its own when the wires fell out after the plastic came off. Lesson learned- never buy a pair of earbuds from panasonic again (unless youre willing to get a defective pair thatll probably break after a month without even touching it). Of course, you might receive the good version, but what are the chances? Panasonic should market this instead as BUY 10 RIP OFFS GET 1 NON RIP OFF. This is probably the only review ive ever written and will ever write (because of the frustration of getting scammed) but you should take my and everyone elses lesson down here and not buy this pair of earbuds for your own safety unless youre willing to gamble and throw your money down the drain.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I use them a lot for taking work calls on my cellphone and listening to music or podcasts on the train or at the gym. The sound quality (especially the bass) is really good for a set of buds - I have a Bose sound system in my car and really have gotten spoiled on a good system, so I can vouch for these buds.
I will say that if i have no music on, these buds do not block ANY outside noise. BUT, i love that - makes for better people-watching and hearing conductor announcements on the train, so i'm not bothered by that at all.
Another plus is the bright color of the cord makes it easy for me to immediately find in my purse - yes, i typically just throw them in there and they get entangled in random stuff and buried at the bottom, but they still work great and the pink is so much easier to locate than a black cord.
Another plus is that, because of how i casually throw them loose into my purse i really notice this quality, the actual soft squishy earbud parts do not easily fall off. I can yank them out of my purse and every time both of the little squish attachments are still there!

Most of them have better sound quality than this one, BUT !

most of them are not as comfortable in my ears as these and all of them cost more ( way more ). I always carry this earbud with me, already for 6 years, sometimes  I lost them, sometimes the give up ( usually after 1 + year ) .  Let me tell you about pros and cons

Pros: very affordable / the sound for the price is really good/ the sound is more balanced than many a bit more expensive ones I've bought/ very comfortable in your ear, sometimes I forget I'm wearing them/ great for running as there is no cord abrasion noise while listening to music, that is very irritating/ sound isolation is adequate.

cons: This is not the earbud for audiophiles/ on the picture you can see how my tangles up, but I'm used to it anyways/ the cords don't have any extra-protection, it does not get damaged easily ( with my experience and I usually fall asleep with these and wake up tangled up in it ), but there is a better chance that you might tear the cable.

I'm using earphones and earbuds very often, like 4-8 hours a day, but this one is one of the most used ones. because of it's comfort and cheap price, I can wear them everywhere and don;t have to worry if they brake or get lost. It's a budget friendly item, that I'm coming back to. It won't replace your high end earphones for an excellent  sound quality, but will have it's valuable place in your arsenal and If you are like me, You might end up using it more frequently than other ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They have a very comfortably loose fit that makes them well-suited for that. If you have smaller ears, they might not be as comfortable at night, because they're made of hard plastic.

First off, I like nice headphones. Secondly, I don't like to break my nice headphones. If you're in the same position and want a pair of earbuds that you won't cry over losing or breaking, but don't want them to sound awful, then these are perfect. No, they don't sound as good as very expensive in-ear headphones. Do they sound amazing for less than 10 bucks? Absolutely.

They're comfortable, well-designed, simple, and durable. The only design problem I have with them is that the thin cables tangle easily, which wouldn't happen if I wasn't too lazy to use a case. With that being said, even though the cables are thin, I haven't found them to be prone to getting shorts (where the sound crackles due to damage to the cord). This is surprising, since I sleep with them on all the time and am constantly untangling them. I have two pair now, just because I wanted an extra pair to pack. I've had the original pair for over a year, and they're still working perfectly.

I have tried other headphones around this price range, and these are the best I've found by a long shot. The other ones I've tried might have better cables or other design improvements, but they typically sound awful. These sound good enough where I don't really feel like I'm listening to cheap headphones every time I use them, which is nice. I've had very bad luck with cheap Bluetooth headphones due to issues with the Bluetooth part of them, so I've stuck to buying wired headphones if I want them to be cheap.

For $10, the sound is pretty good. They have the rubber gasket pieces that seal into your ears, so they block out a decent amount of background noise, and can double as light earplugs. This also means you don't have to turn the volume up as much to hear your music, which is healthier and safer for your ears.

Mine always fit perfectly with the default rubber ear pieces. The rubber is also pretty strong, not extremely squishy like other earbuds; this makes it easy to clean ear gunk from them by flicking them against themselves.

My only complaint is that on a couple of the pairs I've gotten, the music gets cut to and scratchy if you twist the plug to re orient it, which happens fairly often since it uses a 90 degree angle 3.5mm jack. This doesn't happen with my other headphones.

Otherwise, pair them with a Curvy Man headphone cord wrap and they are pretty great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

So I had to return those and get new ones. They sent me the ones without the mic even though I ordered ones with the mic. I am mad because these stopped working within a month. They never leave my bedside table and I don't use them all that often. The right side (side with the mic) is what stopped working. It's not my phone because I use other headphones and an aux cord in my car. I don't have an iPhone so that weird dongle thing isn't an issue either. Not sure how they broke but whatever. Waste of money - don't buy.

Otherwise, they were good. They are a good fit for my ears, sound quality wasn't amazing but it was pretty good. They had a nice long cord, although cheap-feeling. But I didn't care since I only ever used them while in my bed. I can't speak to the quality of the mic, since I never had a chance to use it.

I used to buy them every 6 months or so to be my everyday knock-around earbuds. They were comfortable and sounded fine. I lost a pair recently and decided to buy two of these pairs to make up for it so I could keep them in a couple different places. One of the pairs with the microphone and one without. Both pairs are filled with static in any device I plug them into. I can still technically hear music out of them if I move the connector a bit, but no matter what device I attach them to, there is a background noise of static. One of the headphones even arrived right out of the package coming apart at the seams of one of the plastic earbuds.

I can no longer recommend these headphones to anyone.

I’m not looking for nuances in tone and base either.  I just want to hear what I’m listening to clearly, and these do the trick.  Sometimes I snag them at bargain prices and sometimes I have to pay a bit more, but they are always affordable and last me longer than a year.

Pros:
- Extremely comfortable - fit my ears like a glove. I often forget I'm still wearing them. I can even wear them while laying down on my side and it doesn't hurt at all.
- Great sound. About the same quality as Skullcandy if not a little better, though I'm not an audiophile. Great bass.
- Very clearly marked ""R"" and ""L"" (and R and L matter for these). I've been annoyed when the letters are really small or rub off easily.
- Great cord length
- Still comfortable even after hours of continuous use

Cons:
- Like most earbuds, will probably fall out easily if used when jogging. Best to get buds with emphasis on jogging if that's what you're after

Other:
- I've had these for a week, so time will tell if they break within a couple months like my Skullcandy buds.

Mic? Bonus. These work well for the intended use (movies, ignoring people, etc). I tend to fall asleep while wearing them.
Soooo, I fell asleep with these earbuds last night (watching Lucifer, amazing show). I woke up in the middle of the night with the urgent need to pee. I could barely open my eyes, I was so exhausted, and didn't realize I had my earbuds until one side fell out, halfway to the bathroom. I tucked the 'buds into my shirt, the cord hanging down.
I entered the bathroom and sat down on my throne. After a moment, I looked down and saw that the earbuds had decided to take a swim.
NO! I could not go a day without my earbuds! I just couldn't do it! I know you don't know my situation, but if you did, you would understand that I. NEED. THESE. EARBUDS.
I took them back to my bed and cleaned them. I know, gross, but I'm in a desperate situation here! I put each bud on an end of a Q-Tip. I went back to sleep.
It is now the next morning. My heart pounding, I plugged the earbuds into my phone and pressed play on a YouTube video a friend made for me (""Bodies"" by Drowning Pool music video, search ""DuckDuckGames AMV Redemption"" to see his).
The earbuds still work.

TL;DR:
Pros: work well for streaming Netflix.
Cons: do not prevent people from talking to me.

They fit in the wrong ear, but feel funny of that happens. I put a small dab of White-Out on the left cord so I know which is which when I pick them up to use.

The cord is very long. I can have my phone or iPod in my pants pocket and use these. But I usually clip an iPod Nano or Sony SBH-20 Bluetooth adapter to my shirt and run the wires under the shirt and around the back of my collar. I'll tuck the buds in my shirt at work and pull one or both out for music or phone calls. Even after tying a loop at the Y to relieve stress (that's where most of my earbuds die, at the Y connector) I still have the buds hanging low under my shirt, taking a few more seconds to fish them out than some others I have had. At least the cables are not rubbery and get caught on things like some Sennheisers I've had.

The 3.5mm jack's plastic is squared off instead of round, and I found they don't plug into the bottom of my Nano 4th gen if it's plugged into the dock connector, though I found few aftermarket buds that will. Also, no microphone, but I use a $30 Sony SBH20 bluetooth adapter that has a mic, headphone jack and play controls for calls and music on my phone with any earbuds I want.

They are fine for podcasts and phone calls, and OK for music, with more bass than clarity. They do a decent job of blocking out ambient noise. As a cheap pair to get you through the day or as a backup to toss in a gear bag, they will do the job. Good value, especially compared to cheap Skullcandy buds, but 3 stars for the cables being too long for me and just OK music quality.

I wish they had inline controls and didn't have an L shaped connector, but I knew these things before buying them, so I can't knock them for that.

The cord is a little shorter than I would like, as I tug on my phone when it's in my pocket and I move my head while walking around (I'm 5' 7"" so I'm not even that tall.

I really like the way these fell in my ears, they always feel like they are firmly in my ears and never going to fall out, even when they get tugged on a little as I mentioned before.

The build quality is my only real complaint, after using these for a few months the sound started to go out. For a week or so I could mess with the cable where it goes into the L-Shaped connector and if I got it just right everything sounded fine again, however now they just don't work. No matter how I mess with the cable the sound in on ear bud won't come through, or won't stay when I let go of the L-Shaped connector. Oh well, you get what you pay for, can't say they weren't cheap.

PRO's:
- Fit well, I primarily use these for working out and have had issues with headphones in the past constantly falling out but these stay in perfectly and come with various earbud pieces to suit your preference.
- The sound is very impressive, my main concern is often with cheap headphones when I crank up the volume while watching a movie or listening to music at the gym it sounds like a blown out speaker, but these sound very clear and I don't even have to turn them up very loud to hear them, 2 signs of quality headphones.
- Design, although I'm usually not a fan of headphones that have designated left and right earbuds, (I always mix them up) I will give these a pass because they fit well and look great.  I hate when the earbuds themselves are very large and look weird, but these are a bit smaller and the rubber earbud piece is less circular and more oval shaped so they tend to stay in better.  I also love the plug, its still your standard 3.5mm but its right angle shaped. I usually have the straight ""I"" shape plugs and those will press against my thigh in my pocket and either cause a short in the headphones or screw up the jack on my phone, but the right angle shape on these allows them to rotate one way or another resolving that previously mentioned issue.
- Price, for $7 these are a steal, I normally try not to spend a ton on headphones anyways but these are better than many high end earbuds I've owned.

CON's
- None, these headphones have the perfect combination of quality and price that you really can't go wrong here.

The sound is decent. Honestly about what you'd expect at that price. They're not gonna do it for hard core audiophiles, but the sound is well balanced, and should be good enough to satisfy most people. The thing that makes it worth spending the extra couple dollars on these is durability. I use my headphones constantly. Probably at least 4-5 hours a day, and some days even more. Some days a lot more. My point being, I'm quite hard on them. A standard pair of buds in the $10-20 range usually only last me a month or two before one side or the other goes out on me and I have to replace them. I've already had these for about 4 months, and they still show no signs of breaking down. That alone makes the little bit of extra money I spent on these well worth it. They're also quite comfortable, and stay in the ear well. The angled ear piece is something a little different from most other pairs, and it works great. So yeah, I'd recommend these.

Miller","Do yourself a favor ... don't bother trying these.","October 5, 2019","These buds fit very loosely in my ears.  If I try to push them in slightly, to make them snugger, then the sound becomes very low level and muddy;  probably pushing in the buds obstructs the small hole where the sound comes out.

Sound balance is very much lacking in low frequencies.  By comparison the highs (of course) seem much louder; that makes it difficult to assess the *quality* of the highs.  At any rate, I find the balance very unpleasant for music listening.  They might be OK for audio books, but I wanted them for music.

They have no ""noise cancellation"" because that feature require active circuitry and small microphones on each earpiece.  (In fact I can't think of any earbuds that have noise cancellation, although everybody has heard of the Bose noise cancelling *headphones* which are pretty good.

If Amazon really wanted to ask about ""noise isolation"" ... ability of the device to keep external noise from sneaking into the ear canal ... then these earbuds could have that feature.  They could ... but they don't.  Isolation is almost nonexistent.

The Amazon review form asks about ""moisture wicking.""  How could earbuds have that feature?  Headphones might have a headband with a moisture wicking pad; headphones might have moisture wicking ear pads.  But this product is not a headphone ... it's an earbud.  As such, ""moisture wicking"" doesn't apply AFAIK.

In conclusion, these are very disappointing.  Sonically they are think and basically awful for music.  If you want something that sounds a whole lot better, try a pair of Tascam HD-02 *headphones*.  Sure, they're not earbuds, and they're not the world's best headphones.  But they are acceptable, they are MUCH better than these earbuds, and they cost roughly $18.00.

Of course if you want bad-sounding orange toys in your ears, these Panasonic earbuds are perfect for you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These headphones sound AMAZING for less than 10 bucks. I purchased them in July of 2016 - I wasn't at all familiar with Panasonic Products. Just read everyone's reviews.

The Current pair that I have in my ears have to have over 1,000 sweaty miles of running on them. Honestly, I've sweat, and ran over 1,000 miles in these headphones. I just finished my second Marathon, and these suckers have been in my pocket in nearly 40 states. I wear them every single day - and I'm dreading the day when I have to get the I phone 7 - because I'll have to use Bluetooth headphones, and I hate that.

The ear pieces are comfortably soft and actually do a good job blocking out a lot of outside noise.

The sound quality is good ... Works for me listening to podcasts and when I just want some background music in my head :)

The buds fit in-ear and stays there without slipping out.

They fit snuggly into my ears, and seem to stay ""locked in"" pretty well.

Changing the pads is a little bit problematic, but not enough to really detract from the overall review.

The reason I'm giving 4 stars is simply because, if you have a tragus piercing (that's the flap of skin that covers the ear canal), they're rather uncomfortable.  In fact, they make my ears sore.  I have rings in both of my tragus, and I have to remember, EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. when I put them in to flip the rings up, and then insert the earbuds.  And, after extended wear (I wear them pretty much 4 or 5 hours a day at work), my ears get sore.

Recently I 'upgraded' to wireless headphones to the tune of $50, thinking that I was going to be getting better quality, etc.  The only thing I ended up changing was more money for less volume and less bass regulation.

For the price, these produce a pretty good sound. Not perfect, but good. I run with these headphones 2-4 times a week depending on my schedule, and then to and from work.  They've lasted over a year of hard wear and being wound up into my purse during that time, so they're durable.  Compared to the alternatives.  With all the plethora of options in headphones, I've come back to these 3 times now, so they're not bad at the price point.  For the amount of wear and tear I personally put on electronics, this is well worth it.  I can't imagine buying $200 headphones as often as I would need them, for probably less sound quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

With panny you know the quality is built in. Just like Sony...  Panasonic puts a lot of research into their product and this earphone is no exception. I think it is on par with the Samsung headphones(in ear) or Sony headphones(in ear) but those are a little bit more pricier. I always trusted Panny and these headphones are a steal for the price of lunch...

FIT
I am so impressed by the fit. Very well designed such that they can fit exactly into the ear canal. Blocks out extraneous noise very effectively because they fit so well. Very very ergonomic. I listened to music for several hours yesterday and did not feel irritated or annoyed by the fit.

QUALITY
Sound quality is awesome for this price....
Don't dismiss these because they are so cheap. Always trust Panasonic to deliver value even at this price..

As with any other in-ear headphones there is a going to be a a little bit of leaked audio at high volumes. This is only if you go extremely loud. Otherwise they don't leak sound.

These were the overall winner, and I've purchased several more over time.

Unfortunately, the latest batch is a completely different product. Either Panasonic started skimping on production or these are cheap counterfeits (more likely). I just plugged these into my electronic drum kit and literally could not hear the kick drum's bass sound at all. I thought my kit was messed up, but instead plugged in an older pair of these and noticed not only a clear rolling bass, but all of the sounds were much fuller and richer.

I too have experienced this. I ordered my first two pairs of earbuds in November 2018 and April 2019, both from the Amazon.com Services Inc. vendor, and they were of excellent quality.

I then ordered another pair in August from a third party vendor (a very highly rated vendor, mind you). But the quality of this third pair was far lower than the first two. I brought this to the attention of Amazon and was given a replacement pair. The replacement pair (from same vendor) was also very low quality.  Contacting Amazon again, they offered me a full refund and told me to just keep the earbuds.

About a month later in September, I decided to try one more time (I really love these earbuds). Having realized that the ""counterfeit"" earbuds came from a third-party vendor, I decided to order again from Amazon.com Services Inc. This was the vendor that I originally ordered from. This time, the pair I received were excellent quality.

Now, I'm not completely certain that the lower quality pair were counterfeits. It could easily be that Panasonic contracts many different manufacturing plants to make these earbuds. Some of these plants might have different quality control standards, and this third party vendor (which was very highly rated) might've gotten a bad batch. I did notice a slight difference on the packaging between the earbuds. On the back of the packaging, all the way down at the bottom, there is a four character code. The code for the good pair is 8I1H. The code for the bad pair is 8G3H. My guess is that these codes are either identifying the batch number, or the plant that they came from.

That is all the information that I have. I hope this can help others figure out what is going on. My advice to anyone considering buying these earbuds is to buy two or three pairs from two or three different vendors, compare the different qualities (It will be obvious which pairs are ""real"" and which ones are ""counterfeits""), and return the lower quality pair(s). They are fantastic earbuds if you can get a good pair.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

When I gun was fired to the right side of the screen I heard it coming from the left and when a character from the left started talking I heard it from the right. so I went to my laptop's audio setting and changed the volume in the left and right earbuds and found that the earbuds wires were switched so that every sound from the left you heard from the right and vise Versa. And before you ask yes I did check to see if I had the earbuds on wrong and no I did not I put the earbud with the R in my right Ear and the same for the left.

Machuga","Not bad","November 28, 2016","I go to the gym, cycle, run, etc - about 5-6 days a week, so I go through headphones fairly often, or they end up lost or damaged. I am a little spoiled as the TJ Maxx near me sells Skully Candy head phones for 7.99 that I have been very happy with. But it's located in a very traffic heavy part of town I have not gotten too recently (nor do I want to around the holidays). So these were close in price and a name brand, so I figured I would give them a shot.

I first put them in an they sounded kind of trebley and tinny, and I instantly new what the issue was (another review hit it right on the head in a longer explanation). The biggest size of ear buds these come with don't seal my ear canal. With the sizes shipped, I could hear way to much of what was going on around me at the gym and not enough bass. That seal you get when when you put them in the ear is when you get more full sound. I swapped just the buds with another set and they actually are not at all bad.

They have a little odd disc shape thing that sits in your ear to help keep them in, and the work well.For my ears, anyway, the weren't going anywhere - which ended up being a good thing since the buds were too small Then again, with buds that fit properly, I do not usually have a problem with them falling out anyway.

The only other thing I didn't like is they have the connector at a right angle, and it's quite bulky and square shaped. It just barely fits into the area allowed for by my iPhone case. So if you have a larger more protective case- as many active people using iPhones might- this could be an issue for you (and I think they actually would be a pain for the arm band case I use for running outdoors).

I guess if  I had been paying 15-20 dollars for head phones, I would be more satisfied with these for this price. I have definitely paid more for worse. With the proper fit, they really aren't at all bad. But given the ear buds not fitting me and to a less extent, the jack being large and right angled, I don't think I would order these again. Hence the 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Now, to be fair, in-ear is not my favorite style of headphones, but that wasn't the issue, they were actually fairly comfortable. The issue is the sound isn't consistent and was terrible. When I could get it to be consistently stay plugged in properly, sound was fairly good. My suspicion is the plug isn't built properly - any slight movement of the wire, my phone, etc. would cause the sound to be bad - only in one ear, volume would go down, remote wouldn't work, etc. Would go in an out, especially if I put my phone in my pocket and was walking, which I often do. I'm pretty sure the plug wasn't staying in the headphone jack properly - maybe it was too small? I thought maybe my phone case was doing something (i.e. too thick and was 'pulling' the cord out), but tried without the case and had the same issue.

On another note, couldn't figure out how to use the remote on the wire to change the volume - maybe I was missing how to use it for that, but I'm usually pretty good with this stuff, so pretty sure there wasn't a way to change the volume with it - if this was the case, it is a bad design.

I really wanted to like these headphones, but at least the pair I have just don't work like they should. I'm going to try to replace these, as I'm hoping that perhaps I just got a defective pair.

The headphone piece that sticks out to hold the silicone tip is oval shape, when the shape on the ear tip is circular.

I also have a set of Sony MDR-EX110AP earbuds ... I like the Sony's slightly better due to slight better fit in the ear, but the Sony is deficient in bass. The Sony and Sure HF5's are similar in sound.

The Sure HF5's are far superior to either these Panasonic or the Sony earbuds for sound isolation.

These Panasonic earbuds have an oval shape to the portion that inserts into the ear canal. That shape is a bit too oval for my ears. The other slight deficiency of these Panasonic earbuds is that, even when properly inserted and sealed, they're not very good at keeping outside sounds out. The Sure HF5's have triple seals that make their sound isolation very good (in contrast to these Panasonic earbuds or the Sony earbuds).

I was happy I had purchased the Square Trade as I thought I would be returning it. However, I am glad I waited and took my time because I am no longer having any issues with this product.
I do have one thing I want to point out that the wires on the ear buds are quite thin and for some reason the connection point is L-shaped. This can cause you to have the ear buds over the volume control on your Fire tablet. I would prefer stronger wires and a straight connection.
What I really like about this is the fact that the ear buds are ergonomic and fit in your ear quite well. I like to use mine to fall asleep to at night without waking my husband. These are very comfortable and I like that!
You can purchase these in various colors but I like the basic black which I got.

Cheapest possible wires and flat, tinny sound. Zero bass, and only minimal mid-range (giving you some muddy sounding mid-bass).

Not sure what context to review these in. If you compare them to other $8 headphones, maybe they deserve a positive review. But I think there is a threshold where the sound quality is just so bad there is no value at any price (basically like a generic pack-in headphone or buds). These are right on that threshold.

2* because they work out of box and might be a very slight improvement over generic.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They have a nice, warm and well balanced sound. Full, deep and fat low end without being excessively boomy. I'm genuinely pleased with these little headphones and very impressed with the value they provide.

The fit is pretty comfortable for in-ear noise-isolating earbuds. They do isolate quite well. If I were to suggest an improvement it would be for them to switch to a memory-foam earpiece instead of the little rubber plungers. For now, I like these enough that I will probably just buy myself a set of foam replacements and recommend anyone needing to wear them for extended periods do the same.

The only significant complaint I have about them is that they don't have a volume control as advertised. There is a single button on the microphone body that answers and ends calls, summons Siri and starts and stops music tracks but no volume control function at all.  The little dongle and button look and feel a bit cheap but I'm willing to accept that in light of the really enjoyable sound quality they deliver.

The wire is zip-cord, with 2 side-by-side wires running from the 1/8"" (3.5mm) jack to the Y split to left and right buds. It's remained fairly kinked since coming out of the package and doesn't feel as good or lie as flat as the wire on Apple earbuds but again, the sound quality leaves me willing to overlook these minor considerations.  I paid $12.79 for them and the next-closest price I've ever paid for an earbud that were anywhere near this good were about $50.00 and their wire wasn't any better and they didn't have a mic. So there you go: Great value if you can live without a volume control!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

At some point, I ended up using these as my primary headphones. After adjusting to them, they are actually very comfortable. The first several times I wore them (see my original review, below) they weren't that comfortable but I evidently didn't give them enough of a chance.

1. They are very comfortable to wear even over long periods of time. I use them as my headphones for all day at work and they don't bother my ears.
2. They stay in just fine working, walking, etc. I haven't tried them while jogging but I've yet to have much issue with them falling out or coming too loose.
3. The sound is great for the price. It's not ""Bose"" or anything obviously, but the sound is much better than my Coby earbuds and roughly equivalent to my SoundBot. In short, it's balanced and clear without sounding super bass-y nor tinny.
4. I've just learned today that they are very durable! I was looking all over for them and couldn't find them so I just used some other headphones and what do you know - I had tucked them in a shirt pocket and accidentally washed (and dried) them! I thought for sure they were done for. The cable even felt a little bit softer, but nope! I plugged them into my laptop and started up a video and they still worked. They didn't sound any different than before I washed(!) them. They were very tangled but I can live with that.

Overall, I would highly recommend these headphones now after giving them more of a chance myself. And, if you're like I was initially, try giving your ears a little more time to adjust.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (November 2015):
I read several reviews before buying these and got intrigued. My ears are small or shaped weird - especially my left one. I don't know what it is but I have never found ear buds comfortable. The original kind that have a Hershey Kiss speaker shape that goes in your ear - those are the worst. The soft in-ear kind are significantly better, but still not comfortable to me and they have a tendency to fall out. I prefer regular over the ear headphones but those aren't so acceptable at work.

I bought a pair of SoundBot headphones that were super comfy, but after awhile the left side broke. It still works, but jiggling the wire pauses songs, skips songs, and even turns the volume up or down (which there isn't actually a control on the headphones for). Wanting to find a replacement (and not be locked in to one specific brand of style), I tried these.

For starters, they are cute. I mean, for ear buds. The blue is a pretty blue, it is a bit brighter than say, royal/Superman blue.

Also, they do actually stay in my ears pretty well. The ear piece sort of hooks into the shape of your ear in a similar manner as the SoundBot ones, locking it in place. It isn't stuck in there however, and still relies a bit on the shove-it-in-your-ear factor.

The cord is decently long, a comfortable length in my opinion. However, it is thin. I feel like it could easily have a similar problem within a few months if I don't take extra good care of them. That said, there is no control for anything on these headphones so hopefully if it started getting damaged, it would have no effect.

The sound is very good, especially for the price. I have a pair of cheap, Coby ear buds and the sound quality on those is noticeably lower than any others I have tried - so these are better than that, at least. These I would say are a notch below my SoundBot headphones and a few notches above the Coby. I would say my SoundBot headphones are about on par with my original Galaxy S5 headphones for sound quality,  if that helps.

One thing I dislike is that I can easily hear background noise through these headphones. It isn't crystal clear, but in a noisy office, I find myself having to turn the volume up further. It isn't to say that they are SUPPOSED to have noise-cancel, but I got used to it with my Galaxy S5 headphones and especially with my SoundBot ones. Galaxy S5 headphones block out the majority of background noise, and the SoundBot ones block out all but the loudest. Even without anything playing, they have a noise-cancel effect.

OK, now for my primary complaint. All other factors the same, I would be very satisfied with these headphones if they were only more comfortable. It's strange, too, because on the right ear it's perfect. On the left ear, painful. I have avoided using my Galaxy S5 headphones because they aren't so comfortable to me, but I actually practically retired these ones in favor of those. I don't know what it is about my left ear. I tried switching the medium/default tip for the smallest and I might say that's even less comfortable? I can't quite put my finger on it. The speaker hole is narrower - it's an oval, not a circle, giving almost an appearance like the latest iPhone headphones. I thought that would have been perfect, and it is on my right ear. My right ear could probably wear it all day, but my left ear can't stand it.

So, I know I have talked most this review about my broken SoundBot headphones, but that's only because they are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever found. For me, comfort takes precedence over pretty much all other features (save for price) because I just can't stand wearing most ear buds. That said, here is the fib ranking:

Sound Quality:
1st/2nd: Galaxy S5 and SoundBot (tie)
3rd: These Panasonic headphones
4th: Coby

Comfort:
1st: SoundBot
2nd: Galaxy S5
3rd: These Panasonic headphones
4th: Coby

Appearance:
1st: These Panasonic headphones
2nd: Galaxy S5
3rd: Coby
4th: SoundBot

Price:
1st: These Panasonic headphones
2nd: SoundBot (by a few dollars)
(I can't rank the Galaxy S5 because they can with my phone and the Coby came as part of a set with other headphones)

Features/Functionality:
1st: Galaxy S5 (play/pause/skip/phone and volume)
2nd: SoundBot (play/pause/skip/phone)
3rd/4th: These Panasonic headphones and Coby (tie - no controls)

Overall, if my left ear wasn't so sensitive I would probably love these. Because it is so sensitive, I find them almost unusable. Otherwise, for the price and general quality, I would recommend them for less finicky ears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

You won’t regret it.","April 4, 2018","These headphones are probably the best 8 dollars I’ve ever spent. I just bought this same model for the second time after two years of hardcore daily use. I ride my motorcycle nearly every day using these earbuds, even in the rain. I also use them 3-4 times a week at the gym and just casually throughout my day. The volume is plenty that I can hear over my loud bike even with wind. The sound quality is good enough that you won’t notice any issues unless you’re directly comparing them with significantly more expensive earbuds.

The only problem I’ve had is that after two years of heavy use the connection is starting to cut. For example, if I move around too much my phone will pause the music thinking I pulled out the earbuds. Most likely due to riding in the rain.
I have bought more expensive earbuds and most are lucky to last 6 months with how much I work them. I guess sometimes the cheapest option is also the best.

Therefore, I am buying new ones and leaving a glowing review.

The wires for instance are pretty light weight.  Again for the money, I consider them a good buy.

------

For under $9.00 these Panasonic ErgoFit in-Ear Earbud Headphones were a great buy. I have several sets of ear buds, from these $8 ones, to a range of $40 to $100. While I am not sophisticated enough to compare the specs or sound quality of high end ear buds, for $8 I was not expecting these to sound as good as they do.

I sleep with a set of small ear buds every night, and use several Amazon sleeping apps and albums. I want to go to sleep quickly and to stay asleep. Smaller ear buds enable me to sleep on my side, using a pillow, without being conscious of them. I also don't want to wake up with irritated ear canals. If I break an inexpensive set, I would just pick up another. Right now I am using a $40 set, and I don’t want to toss or turn and break a $40 set. They are just a little too big for me use on a nightly basis. Others may find these are fine to sleep with.

I do use them throughout the week, depending on what I am listening to, or deepening on what I shove in my pocket. My daily range of music includes smooth jazz, classical, blues, country, rock, Indie and pop. If I want a higher quality sound, I reach for a higher quality ear bud. In general these are acceptable. Again they are only $8.

There are reviews with differing opinions on whether or not they are noise canceling and other commenting about challenges to get them seated, to have them be noise canceling. I have been fortunate enough to just be able to pop them in place and they do cancel out general noise distractions. Again, for $8, I would not have to think twice to buy another set, to keep them handy and to use when I inevitably misplace any one, or several sets of earbuds at the same time.

However, let it be known that those budget headphone reviewers are absolutely right about this pair of earbuds.

Pros:
-Nicely balanced eq
-Great sound at all volumes. Maybe not at extemely high volumes, but mind you these are in-ear
-Around $10usd

Cons
-Very cheap. In material quality.

In the $10 price range, there are plenty of contenders that stand to the plate to deliver the best bang for your buck and in all honesty it makes it both easy and hard to pick out great brands. Of course you might consider trying to get a much cheaper pair for $5 but I can’t recommend that especially with my experiences in the past.

In particular, these headphones are pretty good at giving a good enough soundspace and audio reproduction. Listening to bass heavy hits are just as delightful as listening to classical music.

I do own two other earbuds at this price range, JVC Gummies and Skullcandy somethings.

JVC Gummies are a very weak contender compared to the Skullcandy earbuds and Panasonic ergofit earbuds. The other two are... Almost equal.

It's better if you have older earphone to compare with the new one.

First time I bought this earphone around the year of 2014-2015. It was so good that I bought half a dozen within 6 months and gifted to my friends. And I heard that they did the same thing. My earphone was so good that only in last month; left ear is not working. And I can tell you that I used a lot. I am really satisfied with it and definitely worth more than $100.

However, this month I bought a new one! It's not all the same anymore. I don't know what happened! Perhaps after getting so many good reviews ; Panasonic don't care about the product anymore and decreased its quality. Or else, I got my copy from those cheap Chinese replica s from seller like Amazon FBA, drop shipping etc.

I have been on this quest for years as I am always never without my mp3 player or radio.  I am rough on headphones and go through them fairly regularly.  So I am always trying to find inexpensive headphones that sound better than my previous set (Skullcandy Ink'd).  This time, after carefully reading reviews, I purchased 3 different headphones at once, all in the same price range (Under $15.00): The Panasonic RP-HJE120-A (Blue), The Skullcandy Jib, and The 2XL Spoke (Bounty Hunter Collection).

My conclusions were that the 2XL Spoke were adequate, but a distant third place. While the 2XL had definitively better bass than the Skullcandy Ink'd, the 2XL's mids and highs were only adequate.  The Skullcandy Jib completely blew the Scullcandy Ink'd away, with much better bass, mids and highs, I thought I found what I had been looking for, that my quest had ended.  But there was still the Panasonic RP-HJE120 to listen to.  I must say I had little expectation for these after listening to the Skullcandy Jib's.  But what was this?  Immediately the Panasonic's sounded impressive.  After listening to them for a while, I listened to the Jib's again.  I honestly preferred the cleaner sound of the Panasonic RP-HJE120, and the Ergo design was a plus, the fit was just so comfortable.

So there you have my layman's evaluation of these three headsets and my hands down recommendation for the Panasonic RP-HJE120 (I got the Blue, however, I very much doubt that your color choice will affect the sound).

I hope this helped.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound quality is very good. These are better than my headphones from Sony. The bass has depth & the highs are clean. I listen to Pitbull station on Pandora when I work out & the songs sounded really good. I've used my Sony headphones with my phone for as long as I've had my phone & assumed the sound was as good as it was going to get due to my phone. Not the case at all. ""Don't Let Me Down"", by Chainsmokes ""Don't Stop the Party"", by Pitbull never sounded so good! The earpieces are made from hard plastic & The piece that goes into the ear is covered in a silicon type material which is pretty comfortable in that they slip in & out pretty well but don't slip out on their own. The headphones come with a second set of silicon covers which is nice.
Downside:
The earpieces are labeled ""R"" & ""L"" but because the letters are very, VERY small, without my glasses on, it's really hard to tell which is which & in the gym, the lights aren't the brightest so it will be very difficult to tell which earpiece goes in. The way I'll be able to tell is how they fit. I purposefully put them in the wrong ears to see if I could notice the difference & I absolutely could. My plan is to put a spot of bright nail polish on the ""R"" earpiece so I'll know which goes where. The other downside is the earpieces must be placed in MY ears a certain way of they make my ears sore after wearing them for longer than 30 minutes. My typical session at the gym is 1.5 hours. As long as they are situated properly, all is well. I know pretty quickly when they aren't sitting right & they are easy to  move around manually but don't move around on their own so that is good. The last bit that I don't love is the L shape of the pug-in end of the cord. If I don't push hard enough, my protective phone case impedes a proper connection & the music plays from my phone & not through my headphones. In the future, I'd love to see a straight jack end or a longer piece so it can connect without worry of the phone case thickness.

Overall take:
For the price, these provide phenomenal sound quality. The ear pieces can be somewhat finicky, but that could also be my ears & not the overall take from the masses. The silicon covers that slide into the ear are smooth & slide in easily but don't slip out. The cord is long enough for the headphones to be in your ears & your phone can sit on the piece of cardio equipment without feeling too short or falling off due to too little slack. Would I buy these again? absolutely. For those who are looking for a color other than black, these are perfect. The headphones come in a lot of colors. Overall, you are getting a great product & for the price, so far, these just can't be beat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They are very sturdy. I'm a pull-it-out from wherever they are and they can stand it. I've had them last as long as 2 years.

The sound quality is absolutely as good as those wretched Apple ones that won't stay in my ears or the $200 Bose ones that shorted out my iPod on first use  (Bose wouldn't replace the iPod and put me through hell to replace the earbuds! I'm so done with Bose. Their iPod dock for the Bose radio stopped working after a couple of months and they didn't replace that either. Buyer beware) and continually buzzes in the new iPod.

They come in about 10 colors. The ear bud covers are soft silicone, extremely comfortable (looking at you, Apple).

They're $10 or less!!! That's cheap enough to have them all over the house in case I misplace a set. You can have a set in your jacket pocket, car, gym bag, every room in the house, etc. I love that because I lose track of everything (I've learned to cope, these are my favorite coping mechanism).

1. The cord is not silicone wire. It tangles easily.
2. Right angle mini-plug puts excess stress on the wire. I expect it to fail. With straight mini plugs, I can install a piece of shrink tubing over the plug to provide increased stress relief where the wire goes into the plug. Can't fit shrink tubing onto a right angle plug.
3. Size is a bit too large for comfortable sleeping. I use earbuds specifically to help me get to sleep by putting a droning podcast on at very low volume. Out like a light in a few minutes. The earbuds also act like earmuffs to mute room noise. These Panasonic buds are just a bit too long and are uncomfortable in the ear that's against the pillow.
4. Audio quality is so-so but adequate for voice.
5. Expensive for what they are. Can find four sets for less $$ elsewhere.

Pros:
1. The buds are angled such that you can see in daylight and feel in the dark which one is left and which is right.

I've never bought into extremely expensive earbuds but I've strayed into the $100 range before and wound up coming back to the cheaper side because I tend to destroy earbuds because I go to sleep wearing them and by morning they're usually pulled out of the headphone jack and somewhere in the bed, maybe under me having been rolled over 8 times.

I think if you went to your $30 sonys you would get better sound quality.  These earbuds aren't real ""boomy"" so if you're an EDM enthusiast you just need to spend more to get satisfaction from earbuds.  At highest volumes they don't really sound ""accurate"" I guess is the word, some songs the bass notes are more than they should be and on other songs the higher notes get too noticeable.

If you listen to a lot of audiobooks, or listening on an airplane or around people where you just want to hear your music but aren't turning it up particularly loud these are totally decent.  A huge upside is these are quite comfortable and very low profile if you wear them in bed and have them in on your 'bottom' ear.

If you are hoping to really hear your music belted out and have a great musical experience then these aren't the earbuds for you but you shouldn't be looking at sub $10 earbuds anyway.

These have about double the value as their price in my opinion.

 Upon my first listening for music, I thought the Apple sounded better, but I have years of being used to the Apple, and after a few more minutes, I quickly came to appreciate the better bass and noise isolation the Panasonic offer, like they block out noise much better than the apple due to the silicone earbuds. The sound is also a lot more full and clear, which really envelops you when you listen to music. There's also another benefit the silicone tips provide, they're much more comfortable in the ear than the apple, and I regularly wear earbuds to sleep, so these are much more pleasant to sleep with in.

These Panasonics are not designed to be placed in the ears and worn like classic earbuds.  If that's how you wear them, you'll get nothing but tinny sound at relatively low volume (think 1960's pocket transistor radio.) These earbuds are specifically designed to fit snugly into the ear, forming an airtight seal.  If you choose too small of an earpad and/or don't push them in far enough, you won't hear any low-end frequencies. It's only when you get an airtight seal that the earbuds will instantly come alive with full-range sound and volume.

Here's a quick analogy: Tightly plug both ears with your fingers, close your mouth, and hum the lowest note you can.  Now take your fingers away, and notice how almost all of the low end and volume drops out.  That's the difference between a proper fit and an improper fit with these earbuds.  Although the acoustic principles are different, these earbuds must literally plug your ears in order to give you the full frequency spectrum.  Otherwise they'll sound horrendous.

Unfortunately, Panasonic wasn't very forthcoming on their product's packaging about how to wear the earbuds, and I'm certain some unwitting consumers are throwing away perfectly good pairs.

As an audio engineer, I can assure you these earbuds, when properly fitted, sound great.  They're not audiophile-quality earbuds with the sonic transparency of a $200 pair of studio-reference headphones, and they're not as ergonomic as a $150 pair of Westones, but for the price, they are an exceptionally fantastic bargain -- arguably one of the best product bargains I've ever run across on Amazon.  Do they have a lot of bass?  They're not deficient in any of the low frequencies, but they're not bass-enhanced earbuds, either, which some of you may be used to.  They have a relatively nice, flat bass response as is, but if you want extra bottom end on your music, you'll want to boost the low end of your MP3 player's EQ.  Fortunately, boosted lows, even the deepest of lows, are handled very well by these Panasonics.

As a result of how these earbuds are designed to be worn, they could be uncomfortable for some people to wear for extended periods of time.  The earpads are very soft and pliable, though, and I personally don't experience any discomfort wearing them.  Since these earbuds are designed to be wedged into your ear, there are two unique, negative issues to point out:

1. Be very careful not to drop your MP3 player, because having earbuds ripped out of your ear canal is not a pleasant experience.

2. These earbuds may amplify the sound of your heartbeat when it's racing during an intense workout.  The incessant ""tick tick tick"" is loud enough that it becomes extremely annoying during quiet passages in the music you're listening to.

In summary, the audio quality of these earbuds, when properly fitted, will satisfy 99.9% of the general population.  I would not recommend them for bike riding or street running since they block out ambient noise, but if you need some quality earbuds to tune out the world for a while, these Panasonics are an excellent choice and a phenomenal value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The fit in my ears is good enough that they don't fall out or get tugged out easily. However, the earbuds are now falling apart after about 1.5 years, and I need to order a new pair. For under $15, I'm not complaining - these were ""disposable"" from day one, and I've had $40 earbuds that have crapped out in a shorter amount of time.

I had to turn the music up higher than I usually do in order to hear it and the bass and sound quality were not nearly as good as my other pair. I've done a comparison of switching out my old pair with my new ones just to make sure I'm not imagining things and they are for sure lower quality sound. I'm very disappointed and will not be purchasing another pair in the future. I feel cheated because it seems like Panasonic is doing a bait-and-switch using the good reviews from a better product to sell an inferior product now.

On a side note, one suggestion to Panasonic would be to make sure the mic is facing inward when the earbud is in the ear because the one I have faces out so I have to hold it in the right position while I talk or the other person just hears my surroundings instead of my voice. Again, these are cheap so I can understand, but it would make it a much nicer product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

You don't notice until I point it out but once I do, you can't stop staring. The good news is if I live to be 80, I'll finally have normal sized ears. The problem with being a genetic freak like this, is headphones are a pain. Literally. Large headphones that fit over your ears sometimes don't even work because my giant dome makes it hard to go across the top of my head without pressure. If I find a pair that is comfortable, they certainly aren't discreet and mostly an eyesore. Children's earbuds fit comfortably but the sound quality is terrible. Most other earbuds hurt after twenty minutes of wearing them and the sound quality is still bad because they don't really fit in my ears anyway. I've been searching for a reasonable priced pair (because life with cats ='s cord death if accidently left out), with sound and comfort and WOOT! These are it!  I love the fact they give you different sized buds to use and the angle of the bud provides a comfort I've NEVER found with another pair of ear buds.

I mainly bought these babies because 1) I am cheap, 2) I will probably loose them/destroy them by not caring for them properly, 3) Comfort. After some time spent looking, I chose these based on the amount of reviews/price.

I'm using them as I write this review, making this the second or third time I've used them since my purchase so they're still pretty new. As I listen now, I detect a faint crackling on the right side that is breaking the concentration I am trying to cultivate. Because these headphones have been at the bottom of my purse for the last day or so, the fact that one side is crackling may totally be my fault since obviously I haven't been careful in my treatment of them. To be fair, I'm rating them 3 stars because they are comfortable and I don't feel that pressure in my ear canal that I typically do when wearing standard ear buds for an extended period of time (like an hour). I can live with the crackling for awhile but will probably end up throwing them out in a month after I get my money’s worth. I would recommend them to someone like me who is apathetic about headphones and won't be terribly crushed if they get lost.

Anyway, I opened them and have been using them the past two hours to make sure the sound is good and I'm very pleased.

UPDATE : I removed one star from this review because the second night I used these, they stopped working on my tablet. They still work on my phone, but when I try them on my tablet, they won't work. I tried another pair on my tablet and those work fine, so I know it must be these headphones. I have no idea why they'd work on both devices for a day and then the following day only work on one.

They are not meant to cancel noise, which as a runner, you do not want the noise of your surroundings cancelled for safety reasons. The music is always crisp and clear. I've never had a sound quality issue. The cords did not twist or tangle easily, if at all. The cords never frayed or weakened throughout the years of use.

No one can tell they are on my headset or hear background noise like wind blowing, noisy kids and naughty puppies. Yes, I put my earphones away or up high so she couldn't reach them.

So I busted them out figuring I’d buy a new pair for her stocking. Unlike 95% of cheap headphones that I take back out within 30 seconds, I found I had no issue listening to these. While the feel of the cord and materials does feel cheap, and I wouldn’t expect these to last long, they are pretty comfortable and of much better sound quality than others I’ve experienced in the same price range and even higher.

Sure, I could return them to get my money back, but the shipping is on me, and their warehouse needs to inspect them for defects. Reading between the lines, I felt certain their findings would be user error and tough luck for me.

So not expecting much, I purchased the Panasonic ear buds, and I just realized that I've been using the same pair for 8 months. I handle them the exact same way I'd handled the other brand, so Panasonic clearly makes better quality headphones. The buds fit comfortably in my ears and handle the twice-daily cord wrapping around my cell phone without causing internal damage to the wires. Jazz, classical, and rock music all sound fine (my aging eardrums are not the most discerning), but I mostly use the buds to listen to books during my commute. Love them, and will repurchase when needed.

UPDATE: Feb 2019. Almost 2 years later, these ear buds are still going strong. The only flaw is the rubber has started to separate at the connection port, exposing copper wire. But the sound is the same, so I have wrapped a bit of electrical tape around the plug, and we'll see how much longer I can make these last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The fit is perfect and stays snug up to about 45 to 60 minutes of vigorous workouts. If not working out then the fit stays in perfect contact indefinitely. I've been using these for years.

Recently, I ventured out in search of some wireless earbuds/headphones ... and have been terribly disspointed so far.

Here's the scoop ...

Funcl True Wireless Earbuds ... Sound quality is horrible with very little audible bass. The only positive is that they seem to stay in the ear, which some ""true wireless"" fail to do. These Funcl True Wireless Earbuds are far inferior to the $19.99 LETSCOM Bluetooth Headphones IPX7 and $8.35 Panasonic ErgoFit In-Ear Earbud Headphones RP-HJE120-S (wired).

The Bliiq Bluetooth Headphones, HiFi Bass Stereo with Mic, [Hummingbird][Ambient Mode|SpinFit Earbuds] have better sound quality, but simply will not stay in the ear while working out or doing anything else.

Hopefully, this helps others not waste time.

I've been desperately seeking a high-quality pair of wireless earbuds, but so far I'm sticking with the Panasonic and LETSCOM (mentioned above) because they are much much better ... and cost a fraction of Bliiq and Funcl's wireless/Bluetooth.

When I ordered this pair, they were still inexpensive, but the quality had fallen off a cliff. It seems like Panasonic has either outsourced production to an inferior subcontractor or I received some kind of knock off. The largest, glaring problem is that the aux plug is too long. I compared it to my existing pair (which only has one working earbud, hence why I ordered the new pair), and the plug is a couple mm longer at least. This means that it can't lock in to my aux plug on my phone the way the old ones did, and it also means that there's a huge amount of static and interference whenever the plug is rotated at all. It makes it impossible to listen to anything. General build quality has taken a nosedive as well between my older pair and these, they don't seem nearly as solidly made.

I also love/hate that they work effectively as ear plugs that block out ambient noise. Let me explain. I have a very loud muscle car and drive with the top off all the time. The sound of the car, the wind, and the other vehicles around me is very loud and drowns out the sound of other earphones unless I crank the volume waaaay up. Putting these buds in cancels out all that other noise so I can focus on the music and not have to blow my eardrums out in the process. That's a big LOVE right there. Unfortunately, if I wear them at the office to listen to my music while I work, I have a very difficult time hearing when someone is trying to get my attention, even with the volume turned down.

(Read, cheap!)  When they arrived, I was really disappointed that they sounded so crappy.  Even though I was aware that an air-tight fit was really important, I assumed that my ears would be a ""medium"" size, so I used the medium silicone plugs.  I nearly returned them, but on a whim I tried the large size silicone plugs.  Wow, what a difference!  Suddenly my music came alive!  They really are amazing for under $10.

Pros:  Amazing bass.  Overall really good sound.  Super cheap.  They stay in my ears while running -- they don't even come close to falling out now that I am using the large sized silicone plugs.  Actually quite comfortable, even with the larger plugs.  So stupidly cheap, if they die -- whatever.

Cons:  Red is not red -- it is pink.  Whatever, I don't care.  Lots of ""thudding"" noises from running.  Oh well.  No volume controls.  Really, Panasonic?  Really?  What would that cost?  It might cost another $0.25, and I'd pay another $5.  Sounds like a win-win.  But again, whatever.

I've purchased one this May and another this July, and when I got sick of repurchasing the item, I've attempted to contact Panasonic to have the item warrantied. When I called the Panasonic phone line that was listed on my order, I was informed that the wait time to reach a rep was around 20 minutes, and I might potentially be charged ""$9.99"" for the call. I hung up immediately and attempted the online support chat. Before the conversation even started, and before I said anything, I was told ""this product has a 90 day warranty"". Which leads me to believe Panasonic wants to discourage their users from attempting to warranty their items. I was told that in order to use the 90 day warranty, I will need to ship the item to one of their facilities, and I would need to pay for the shipping.

Panasonic appears to go out of their way to provide short window for warranties, and even when you qualify for the warranty, discourages you even further by having you shell-out for shipping, which basically amounts to the cost of a new product.

Needless to say, this will be the last time I purchase earbuds/earphones from Panasonic, and this will have bearing on my purchasing decisions in the future for all Panasonic products and services.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

While cheaply made with very thin cords and so on, the price is fantastic. The sound is fine for listening to the news on my laptop while not disturbing others or listening to my voice messages on my phone while maintaining privacy. Audiophiles will want something more sophisticated but will pay far more.

One thing I like about these is that the pin you plug in is at a 90-degree angle so that when I have my laptop on its side it doesn't stick straight out and I can scoot the laptop a little onto the base I keep it on so that the pin doesn't break off.

They come in a blister pack with some printed material and two extra sets of rubber ear pads--one set that is larger than the set that's installed and one set that is smaller than the installed set. There is no case or bag included.

I purchased this after the earbuds included with my S5 phone began to fail after 30 months, including times when I accidentally sat on them and pulled, probably pulling on the wires in the process. Plus, the plastic parts started to fall off. Because I wanted to take time to find the best set of earbuds or earphones to replace them without going overboard, I decided to buy these just so I could listen privately to things until I had time to research. I decide I could tuck them into a tiny zippered plastic bag and keep it in my bag for use listening to my phone when out and about and then keep the nicer pair I get after research at home.

The only reason I'm giving this a 3-star rating is that these are flimsy looking and I don't expect them to last a long time. For the price, they are perfectly adequate. This would be a decent set to give to a kid prone to losing things so they can keep them in their backpack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Simply designed, comfortable fit, and great sound. I have had an older pair made by Sony forever but I guess I didn't notice the loss of sound quality. Particularly, lower bass tones. With the new ones, those tones are very obvious...almost like I am hearing music for the first time. Also, the Panasonic Ergofit, when fitted properly, block out lots of exterior sound and you may even hear your heart. As such, if you are a high volume happy person, you may want to turn down the volume a bit. It just isn't necessary to blast these like I sometimes did with my older pair---granted, those are from days long gone when CD players were the main source of music. The fact that they lasted this long is great enough so if the new Panasonic last half as long, they are certainly the best money can buy at a fraction of the cost of higher end items.

Update: 9/22/16 Still love these and they are holding up with daily use. I can't lie. Sometimes I love avoiding people so not being able to hear anyone when I have these in is a secret pleasure.

I ordered a new pair as my old ones had finally kicked the bucket, the same exact pair as my old ones. This time, the part that plugs into the audio jack was crackling constantly and the audio would cut in and out when it was touched. The right earbud was also much quieter than the left. I sent them back and ordered a replacement of the same exact headphones, thinking my problems would be solved. Nope, they got even worse. Same exact problems with the replacement item, only now the right earbud won't even fit into my ear properly (I've never had problems with it before, and even got a relative to try it out, she also said it didn't fit correctly) while the left earbud stays in snug like it should.

The main picture of the earbuds actually make it hard to tell but they are actually designed with the rubber insert off-center from the rest of the earbud, making them specific to right or left ear exclusively. This isn't that annoying in practice, but after about an hour of wear the plastic edge that sticks out and is supposed to rest outside of your ear-hole while the rubber nubbin thing goes in starts to really hurt. It's kind of like that weird pain you get on your ears when you wear a beanie for way too long. The really annoying thing about this is that it seems to be done as an added feature, like they produce two different buds, when in my experience earbuds that are both the same symetrical shape without the plastic bit sticking out work just as well and are way more comfortable. And it seems like they know this isn't even a particularly desired feature becuase the picture shows the only two angles that obscure this asymmetry: if they showed an angle from above it would be really clear, or even one from the side looking into the speaker hole would make it clear because the appendage where the cord attaches wouldnt be obscuring it. Maybe they chose this view because it has the logo on it, but one more angle would be helpful.

If you've tried earbuds that have this asymmetrical design, which rests hard plastic inside the valley of your ear instead of just being exclusively insertable rubber insulation, and have found them comfortable or secure or better for whatever reason then I would say these are great for the price. Personally in the future I'm going to look for the normal round ones, a preference I didn't even know I had before these guys.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

If and when I move out of my current apartment, I'll probably find a dozen pairs in the weirdest places.)

Because I'm so prone to ""losing"" them — [typed with heavy side-eye aimed in the cat's direction] — I tend to find the cheapest ones I can. I've got a more expensive Bluetooth set, but I'm terrible at remembering to charge them, so I like to have a corded pair handy and the last time I was shopping for earbuds, I opted for these. (Mental note: next time, get a bright pair even if the black ones are cheaper...easier to find.)

I point this out to make sure you understand my selection criteria: they have to be cheap. I don't need them to be attractive or have the best sound or whatever people normally try to find when they're shopping for earbuds. I mean, yes, I'd like them to work period, but for the most part I use them in bed to watch Golden Girls reruns on my phone. High quality is just a bonus.

And yet I'm still giving these four stars; for the price, they're absolutely fine. They get tangled worse than Christmas lights, but I've yet to find a pair that doesn't do that, so I can't really downgrade them for that. And no, they don't sound like a state-of-the-art stereo system.

The only issue is that the green earbuds don't have the microphone like the blue pair does. I bought the blue pair because I loved the green pair, but wanted a microphone.

I keep them in an old Altoids case when I'm not using them to protect the wires.  One of the things I really like about these is that they stay well in my ears during walking.  The previous two pairs I had been using, which came from local stores, kept slipping a bit out of my ears as I would walk.  I generally walk around 4-4.5 miles an hour when I'm out walking, so I think they'd also stay in well for a light paced jog. I don't know how they'd do for running. When I first got these, I was able to go out walking about 5 days a week.  My current schedule has become more complicated and I have to do more HIIT at home after my weights, which is a bummer, because I'm a lot more mellow when I get to go on a longer walk, it has mood magic for me that HIIT totally doesn't, but  I do still get to use them occasionally for that.

I am able to fit these in my ears without them falling out, unless I’m sweating it out at the gym. After using them for a few weeks, the sound through them is perfect bliss. However, I’ve had multiple pairs of these headphones fail after around 3-6 months of use. One of the earbuds will inevitably become fainter than the other, or quit producing sound entirely. It’s a shame they fail so quickly – I would expect them to have a longer lifespan, more like a year.

Unfortunately I damaged my last pair, so I of course decided to reorder these based on my great prior experience. To my dismay the pair I received can only be described as worse than garbage. No, I'm not even sure that's a fair description because it doesn't do justice to the garbage headphones out there. Imagine that the music you love was first sent through a massive body of water for some good ol' distortion. After your music managed to cross the ocean, it was then transported childhood-style through a ""tin can telephone"" for refinement. Once/if the music had managed to survive that you get the privilege of listening to the songs you enjoyed being butchered.

Want a better way to listen to music? Find a $0.99 bluetooth speaker from the depths of your local dumpster and give it a try. I'm sure it would surpass the quality of these headphones by a wide margin.

With partial joking aside, I'm just disappointed that an affordable series of headphones has declined so significantly in quality from when I last purchased them.

I had pretty much settled on Griffin EarThump earbuds as having pretty darned good sound in the less-than-ten-bucks arena, but Griffin has gotten out of the earbud business, so I had to find a new supplier.  (You can still find some sellers with remaining stock, but the writing is on the wall...)

Based on reviews here, I decided to order a pair of Panasonic ErgoFit buds to try.  After a month or so of use, I have to say I am really impressed.  I thought the Griffins were pretty good, but the sound of these Panasonics blow the Griffins out of the water.  Nobody is going to confuse these with expensive over-the-ear earphones, but for casual use they sound terrific.

With any of these earbuds, proper fit is essential.  Their small drivers rely on you getting a good seal when you insert the buds in your ears.  With a good seal, you get good low frequency performance; without a good seal, you lose the low frequencies and everything sounds tinny.  Most come with several sizes of interchangeable ear pads.  It's important to experiment to find the pads that fit your ears best.  The shape of the tube over which the pads fit on the Panasonics is oval, which gives a slightly oval shape to the pads, and this seems to fit my ears very well (with the larger pads).  I use the MP3 player when mowing, and with the Panasonics, I don't have to shove the buds as firmly into my ears as I used to to block out the mower noise.

[Added June 2018]  Here it is almost two years later, and I'm still using this same pair of earbuds.  Never have I had a pair last anywhere near this long.  I've just ordered a pair for my wife, who has been going through my old cheapies that came with various devices like water, plus a couple more for backups.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have bought sooo many (official/approved) Apple EarPods, and they all break. Mostly because when I put my phone in my front pocket and then sit down, the cable juts out from the phone in a straight line, and eventually it wears out, so that signal starts cutting out to one of the ears, or the microphone fails.

And I've tried to buy knock-offs, and those sound terrible, or their mics are awful.

Today, I received this Panasonic ErgoFit. I've tested the sound and the microphone. Both are excellent (for this price). And, best of all, the right-angled jack means that now my phone will sit easier in my pocket, and the cable will be less likely to get damaged.

I'm hoping these last a long time.

If you're looking for an affordable set of ear-buds that sound good, have a good microphone for calls/dictation, and a right-angle jack, I heartily recommend this.  And I'm someone who *rarely* writes reviews.

UPDATE !
I love these earbuds so much, I keep buying them when I lose my last pair.  I forgot I wrote this review, then I wrote another review, but amazon wouldn't let me post it because this review already exists. Anyhow, this is what I wrote today May 21st 2019 :
_________
I used to think Apple Earbuds were the best until I tried these. These sound incredible, and the microphone sounds great to whoever is calling you. The rubber fittings on the earbuds feel great and block out just the right amount of ambient noise. They're so comfortable.

I'm a professional musician & producer, and I've been so disgusted by other earbuds terrible speakers -- often way too sibilant, or distorted.  I fear they inflict ear damage.  Not these. These sound well balanced across the EQ spectrum.

My only complaint is with myself : I keep losing earbuds. I've literally bought these 4 times.  For Christmas and birthdays sometimes family gives me earbuds, but those always sound terrible, and I keep coming back to this pair. For example, my mom bought me Apple Earbuds for Christmas, assuming I'd prefer them. But then I did a test. I called her from the other side of the house, and I switched the earbuds back and forth between the Panasonic and the Apple, and asked her which one sounded better when I was speaking through the microphone.  She chose these ones!  Even though they're much more affordable!  She was shocked.

I'm not loyal to any brands, but, wow, Panasonic really got this one right. THANK YOU.  Seriously, the market is flooded with terrible sounding earbuds, and it's really hard to find one that:
- Earbuds sound great
- Microphone sounds great
- Comfortable
- Affordable

I give these my highest recommendation.

Let's see if they last.","October 7, 2017","I bought these based on the great reviews here but they really sound like average 8 dollar earbuds. In fact, when using them on my laptop I could hardly hear anything so I switched to a cheap sports ear buds (they are called ihip warrior) and these were a lot louder. The last pair of earbuds I had were from a drug store. The sound quality was average but they lasted over a year including falls and snags. If the panasonics break in less than a year I'll update the review.
One more thing, the cord for the Panasonic earbuds came really bunched up and tangled and the packaging was the kind I have to use scissors and pry open which is a real hassle for some cheap earbuds.

Edit: These earbuds lasted for more than a year with average use. They only broke after I fell asleep on them. I was going to buy them again but I see Amazon has raised the price to $10 (and pretending that is a sales price from $15). I originally paid $8.87 for these and that all they are worth to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'm certain that I've never beat up any of them, nor have I scolded them for anything they did or did not do. In fact, when it comes to earphones, I've always acted like a dotting parent or sometimes, smitten admirer. I've always started off loving them to bits and they loved me right back for a while, then they grew up (headphone years are like dog years, you blink once and it's terrible twos, blink twice and it's rebellious teens, so the honeymoon usually did not last very long) and became obnoxious things. I have tolerated a lot of bad behaviours, but when they let the precious connection between the ear buds and the cord fraying away (and they always do), I have to put my foot down. Time to open the wallet once more.

I can't count how many pairs of earphones have passed through my life that way. All with pedigree or well-known parentage -- Apple, Sony, Panasonic, Skullcandy, Dre, Plantronics, Koss, Philips, JVC, Pioneer, etc -- and all came and went without leaving a lasting impression in my memory. Except my precious Bose QC, but they fit over the ears so they don't belong in this lamentable tale.

Enter this pair of Panasonic ErgoFit. Not the first pair of Panasonic earphones I've owned. Today is still a couple of days short of 6 weeks since ErgoFit and I became partners. We are constantly with each other and with beauty music flowing between us -- Agustín Barrios, Joaquín Rodrigo, Émile Waldteufel, Buster Smith, Toots Thielesman, Laurindo Almeida, etc. Chuck Prophet sometimes drops in and that's fun too. We also enjoy Cornelius Garrett, Michael Drew, Sian Phillips, Clifford Norgate and many others giving their voices to Georgette Heyer novels, over and over and over again.

As mentioned above, it's not quite six weeks yet so my new relationship is still rosy. If I don't come back to alter this rating of 4-star in a few months, then it means I've found true love with Panasonic ErgoFit. Wish us luck.

Edit: My faithful ErgoFit earphones were chewed up by a curious Bichon Frise named Bear during Thanksgiving week when we visited his owners, my husband's sister and her husband. Immediately after we returned home, I placed another order, and this second ErgoFit pair works just as beautifully as the first, thank you Panasonic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Every set compared has been with high sample rate (48k/24bit) media both flat and with adjusting EQ.

They have all consistently either broken or degraded after time has passed.  Some have annoying cables that make noise in your ears when they rub against clothing, some have cables that break or become frayed, and some become tangled incessantly.

The Panasonic HJE-120s have never let me down. For the price, the audio quality is great and the physical quality of the pair is also great.  They're cheap enough where I throw them in my pocket, or my bag and don't really care if something happens to them. However, they've never broken on me or made me disappointed.

I lightly used them, and the sound started to cut out and crackle. I contacted Panasonic, and they gave me a full refund without hassle, which I appreciate.

These earbuds are interesting. On the one hand, the build quality and design leaves a lot to be desired, on the other, the sound quality is amazing. I tested these across a range of music and audio listening devices, and the sound was consistently great. The bass was deep and rich with a warmth that most earbuds in the sub-$50 range lack. The mids and highs came through crystal clear but never piercing. Even at high volumes, it never gave me a headache like cheaper headphones tend to. I was genuinely impressed with how amazing these sounded.

Unfortunately, the build quality feels cheap, and after minimal use, these began to cut out and stopped working. It was disappointing because I really loved listening to these.

I purchased these to replace some no longer made JVC earbuds that did work well for when I was bicycling, hiking, fishing, out and active, at work, traveling, etc.

These came highly recommended for a tight budget, and the sound they make is great.

But seeing that the JVC's I used to buy were constantly only $4-5 more at most when I purchased them there's a few issue with these that hold back one star.

The fitment while good doesn't hold...at least in my ears, no matter the bud size provided. Might try some marshmallow buds later.

The cable is easily to tangle and has no split secure slider. Makes it a pain to keep these wrapped up and easily unwrapped between uses. I spend more time untangling these than I should need to.

With that said, they sound absolutely GREAT for the money, plenty of bass, clear mids and crisp treble. They might even sound better than the Carbon Nanotube gimmick the JVC's flaunted, and I really do enjoy listening to them, from my phone, MP3 player, laptop(s), etc.

Overall happy with them! Even with my gripes, these have easily earned the 4-star rating after a Summer's worth of use they're holding up well, and even with all the tangles I've had they're still in great shape and no major cable memory issues.

Make Sure You Push Them In For Best Fit!","January 31, 2017","Okay this is my first time leaving feedback on an item, but I'm just so amazed that I have to take the time to do so. To preface, I was super duper skeptical about the reviews on these little cheapy pair of earbuds being worth all the positive reviews and praise. So really, I bought them for that reason because I normally HATE earbuds and prefer regular headphones. Now I understand the hype! This is what I have always wanted earbuds to sound like, honestly.

I have never, not once, found a pair of earbuds that met ALL of the following criteria:
- fit snuggly
- fit comfortably (I have only had these in a short while, but plan to put them through a couple hours of use to see if they hold up and don't hurt my ears)
- didn't fall out during exercise/jumping around/just shaking my head (I was convinced my ears were just shaped weird and not meant for earbuds)
- sounded comparable to a pair of regular, on-ear headphones (in MY opinion, as I'm no audiophile and only know what I personally like to hear)
- had noticeable bass despite being EAR BUDS!

About that last point -- if they still sound ""tinny"" or lack bass to you guys who have purchased them, try pushing them further into your ear or switching out the in-ear pieces to a different size. I initially just ""placed"" the buds in my ears, turned on the music, and was disappointed. They sounded the same as my Apple earbuds! It wasn't until I actually did as another commenter said to do and PUSHED THEM IN. Kind of like you would with ear plugs! If you're like me, you'll notice quite a difference in sound quality doing that. It cancels out all outside noise completely when the music is playing which is insanely awesome for what were only $9 earbuds!

I'm amazed and impressed and actually can't wait to exercise with these in, haha. And that right there is reason enough for me to give these five stars, so now I just hope they keep performing well and don't hurt my ears longterm, which is my only concern and something time will tell! I may just buy an extra pair for the future just in case these stop being produced or something lol.

When I originally bought them I needed them as all-purpose headphones which I could bring to school, use in the weight room, and use while doing work around the house. For a large portion of the time I've had them that's exactly what I've used them for, and they've worked like a charm. It is important to note, however, that these headphones are all-plastic, so they will take some abuse but will get damaged if the situation gets too rough. (I'll touch on that a bit more later).

For the price, the sound quality of these in-ears is fantastic. When I let a friend use them once, he immediately responded with ""whoa."" For $10 earbuds the sound is very impressive and probably suitable for most people. These headphones have a balanced sound with enough clarity to deliver the basic framework of whatever music you're listening to, plus a little bit more. If you're mostly a passive listener and want cheap earbuds you won't have to worry about if they get lost or stolen, these are a great buy.

When I eventually upgraded to more expensive earbuds, these ones were able still to hold a candle to the competition, although with further comparison the Panasonic's are slightly ""blattier"" and ""fuzzier"" than higher-quality, more expensive options. On their own, though, these earbuds sound significantly better than others in their price range, even rivaling some costing around $25.

I used these earbuds as my primary listening medium for about nine months and they withstood a lot of abuse. Every day I would take them to school, usually stuffing them in the smaller pocket of my backpack and carrying them wherever I went. For a long time, they stood strong. However,  I pulled the buds out of my ears one day and the right side wasn't all together. In fact, the right speaker had split off from the rest of the earbud's housing. However, the wire to the speaker was still intact and after I gently snapped the two pieces back together, both earbuds worked just the same. Unfortunately, I was long passed the ninety (90) day warranty for the headphones and there was nothing I could do to have them fixed. From then on, I have had to be careful when pulling the right bud from my ear, but besides that, nothing else has broken.

Now, these earbuds have long been replaced by more expensive ones with higher sound quality. Currently, I use them as my main running earbuds:  these headphones are good enough to get me in the groove, but I wouldn't be too upset if they broke. So far, they have managed fairly well despite their earlier injuries and despite being sweated on a great deal. They still work just fine and sound exactly how they did when I first got them.

Pros:

-Cheap
-Sound GREAT for the price
-Reasonably durable
-Ergo fit (fits very well in your ears & helps you figure out which side is which)

Cons:

-90 day warranty
-Plastic housing
-Thin shielding on the main cord

The Panasonic's also come with a mic and a pause/play button on the cord. It's also important to mention that these headphones are in-ears and fit pretty snugly in your ear, which I think helps block out sound and helps to keep the bud in place. For some people this could be uncomfortable and be a big negative for them.

Overall, the Panasonic RPTCM125's are great-sounding headphones for the price, which you can take around with you almost anywhere. They will withstand a lot of abuse but, sadly, are only covered under warranty for the first three months. Recommended for the listener who wants a pair of powerful headphones for cheap.

Sound is excellent, more bass resonance than there is any reason to expect (I tested them on the filmscore suite to ""Blood Diamond."" Pull it up on YouTube if you haven't heard it -- all amazing African percussion),  The best part is that the little hard straight bit that extends directly out from the bud itself like a stick is quite short, so it fits smoothly, without pinching or pressing the earlobe, under a heavy-duty sound killer headset designed for using on a firing range or heavy construction -- I'm not a shooter, but I am a writer in New York City, and there are times when an artillery range would be preferable.  With the sound killers, these little buds put you on your own planet -- I can't say enough good about them.  The 3-size selection of bud caps to custom fit to your ear is a brilliant touch.
The bubble package is a complete pain in the ass to get into -- be careful you don't have the little spare bud caps fly across the room when you finally wrangle it open.

I thought they were pretty good, but these are better.

The sound quality is very good. My laptop has always had a very pronounced hiss over my S3 headphones. With these, the hiss is much less pronounced. Obviously they won't be able to duplicate bass the way larger speakers can, but because they seal the ear canal they actually do a pretty good job with the bass, producing a very nice and even sound.

Comfort is also very good. They come with three different sizes of rubber cushions, and the shape of the earbuds very nice. It's lower profile than my Samsungs and it also conforms more to the shape of the ear, helping to keep them from falling out.

The way they seal the ear canal also provides a little attenuation of background noise. You couldn't use them as ear protection when shooting a gun or anything like that, but they help a little with background noise and such.

All in all, very happy customer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Since then, I've bought the same thing for my wife, and another one for me, just in case my first set ever goes out.  In Zoom/Slack conference calls (not phone calls), I often get compliments on how well my voice comes through and when I switch from my phone's built-in mic to the Panasonic headset I've been told ""wow, that's a lot better, you could be a podcaster now"".

I really like the low price, nice fit, and high quality mic.  The headphones are very usable, but for the price point, don't expect thumping base or even frequency response across the whole spectrum.

I've used them for about 2 years and have purchased three pairs within the time span. The sound quality is great, and I love the shape of the ear bud - you don't have to squish it in your ear, it just glides right through! Also, while being comfortable, they don't fall out easily, and they also aren't bad for working out from my experience. Aside from that, they have also lasted me for quite a bit, the longest being 8 months.
My complaint is that out of the blue, my earbuds are having this horribly loud static noise coming from the left ear after putting them in. I've had these for 8 months, so I'm shocked they kept up so long, but normally when my earbuds start ""dying"", one of the buds does not have any sound. I would have taken that over the horrible static. It was so loud you could feel it, and my ears are a little sensitive, so it was extra unpleasant. So that's the big reason for the 4 stars, but also because I feel that they could improve on the audio jack shape (if that's what it's even called?) for the cable. It's a bended L shape for these earbuds, and they may not suite some phone cases. I recently changed cases, and the only way it would fit was by me positioning it a certain way. It was bothersome having to keep it that way, because I move around a lot and like to keep my phone in my pocket while I clean or exercise. Suddenly, my music stops since I moved a bit, and I keep having to repostion it. My new phone case probably wasn't designed for this type of cable shape in the first place, but I feel that if they stuck with just a long, non bended shape, it could be better suited for all cases. If they won't change it, it would be nice for them to add a photo of that to show the buyers the shape of the cord so they know what they are getting.
I suggest buying 2 pairs after you try them for the first time and getting one of those two year warranty things. That way, you can still have one pair to listen on while the other is being repaired (this option is for the die hard music lovers like me who need it everyday and night!). Now I'm switching over to another brand that may suit my phone case and my preferences, but I definitely recommend these. I'll probably come back if I'm not satisfied with my next pair.

EDIT: Hands down best earbuds you'll get on Amazon. My last pair lasted 8 months, much longer than others I've had. Other earbuds here that are at a decent price don't sound as great as these. I tried moving onto another brand, but they were about the same price, and they were horrible! I'll take Panasonic back, so sorry for ever switching. Now and forever my go to for earbuds. Also, the audiojack fits perfectly with the case, I'm assuming they changed something, at least for the earbuds with the mic. Love Panasonic, never leaving again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wear these for 3-5 hours a day for commuting and workouts.  The first pair lasted 8 months before the right channel started cutting in and out.  This is from the tip wearing out over time which is expected. Other models in this price range would fail under heavy use as soon as a few weeks and certainly within 3 months.

The sound quality is nothing to get excited about.  When they are fit properly in your ears the sound is VERY mid-range heavy almost like an old AM radio and they also suppress external sound.  I have no idea what the  Wirecutter is talking about in their review by the way.  For apps with EQ I cut the mids and boost the bass and treble to clear up the sound.  Apps that don't have EQ are muddy and unlistenable.  The noise suppression caused cramming an expanding earpice in your ear is disconcerting for phone calls.  I find I can't hear my own voice and have to take the left earpiece out to hear myself.

Still for the price, this is a solid option.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They were 5 star quality compared to more expensive headphones that I previously purchased. I am a runner so I constantly run into (no pun intended) the issue of sweat seeping into my earbuds and causing them to die out. That was not the case with this pair of headphones so I thought that I was in a good place. After everyday use for about 10 months, one of the earbuds went out. Considering their price, I thought that was great! I had no problem purchasing another pair. Because I loved them so much, I purchased 2 pairs this time. One for use now and the other for use after these eventually blew out. I bought these two back in May of 2017. The first pair of the May purchase just blew out last weekend. BUMMER, but that is what the second pair was for! My only issue is that once I opened the second box (of the May 2017 order) and placed the earbuds in my ears, no sound was coming out of the right earbud. I am super irritated. It would have been different if they died out after at least a couple of months, but these babies were defective right out of the box!

When they first arrived I was so happy with the sound quality, comfort level in-ear, and their ability to block outside noise. I use my headphones for schoolwork or to watch movies on my computer; I am by no means rough with them, I store them carefully, I'd had my last pair for 8 years, etc. However, only one month after purchase, the left earphone suddenly shorted out and ceased working. I attempted to return them through Amazon and was instead told to contact Panasonic directly.

I tried numerous times to use the Panasonic website's live chat support feature but kept getting a message that there were no employees on live chat at this time (no matter what time of day I tried). I then called their 1-888 support number and the first thing the automated message warned me was that I risked being charged a $9.99 service fee for help if I continued with the phone call and if my product turned out not to be covered under warranty. Given that I didn't know if the earphones were still covered under any limited warranty, I opted to just hang up at that point, write off my money spent, and order a second pair. They arrived on January 25, 2018, and again, I was satisfied. Less than two weeks later, while watching a homework video, the right earphone suddenly shorted out and stopped working.

I called Panasonic again figuring that this time it had to be covered under some warranty at less than 2 weeks old. The customer service rep sent me the e-mail instructions to submit my proof of purchase for both pairs and I later received an e-mail back with the instructions for shipping the headphones. They stated that I was only allowed to ship the product in one specific type of corrugated cardboard container, that it needed to be  certain size of that container, and that I would need to pay for tracking and insurance on the product on top of the shipping. The total amount for shipping cost more than THREE pairs of these headphones and they wouldn't guarantee that they would send me two new pairs to replace the two broken ones.

This is the worst experience I've ever had with a purchase from Amazon. I was disappointed and frustrated that I could not conduct my return directly through Amazon and have a replacement sent to me or my money refunded like is usually the case on Amazon, but instead had to do the whole runaround with Panasonic, and I still don't know whether Panasonic will honor its warranty and send me two new pairs. Based on the number of positive reviews for these earphones it seems like I did just get unlucky (twice) with defective pairs, however, if you're one of those unlucky ones you can count your money spent as lost based on the incredible hassle and lack of good customer service to make it right.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

These came up near the top of the list and, though I was a little skeptical with the idea that you get what you pay for, I figured I'd at least use them as a back up if they weren't the best product. I received these at my doorstep in two days' time and ripped open the packaging (may take a pair of scissors, it's packed very well) with the solid intention of beating them up a little.

The first thing I noticed was how much environmental sound they blocked out just by the fit alone. Straight in, the cups seal my eardrums from the outside world nicely, a plus in my book. They don't cancel the noise, but they do work as earplugs in a pinch. One of my ""go-to"" tester songs is Alabama 3's Woke Up This Morning. I actually had to turn down the volume on my MP3 player with these buds in my ears. The bass response was good (don't expect 8"" subwoofer hits with an $8 pair of earbuds) and punched nicely, the overall midrange level was crisp. Next, I tried some Blues Traveler and the clean guitar sound came through beautifully. Having played it for a few hours almost non-stop while working, I can confidently say the fit is still as cushy and comfortable is it was the first minute.

Laflamme","Great sound quality and blocks out background conversations in a variety of languages...","September 15, 2016","I needed a new set of ear buds to use with my phone and iPod for use primarily while I was at work.  I work in IT in a busy, noisy environment and while I was intrigued by the noise cancelling ear buds, I was very put off by the price.  Initially, I chose these because of the price point and their high rating and I have to report that the price point belies the quality and performance of these ear buds.  I found that it is important as noted in another review to make sure that these fit snugly in your ears - then you will marvel at the quality of sound and their ability to block out background noise.  Listening to a live recording of Dave Brubeck, it was almost like I was at a concert of his.  The added benefit is that they also effectively blocked out nearby loud conversations in English, Hindi, Urdu and possibly Russian (or some other Slavic language).  With these babies in my ears, I can barely hear the guy in the next aisle who suffers from a chronic and untreated sinus condition.  All in all, I love them.

The only bad points I can possibly see - and time and use will tell - is that they seem a bit ""delicate and small"".  The buds that fit in your ear are well made but the part that attaches to the cords doesn't stick out of my ears and I worry when I have to gently tug the bud out of my ear by the cord.  As I use these more I'll find out how tough they are - they may very well stand up well.

All in all, these are a great product - fantastic sound if fitted properly (easy to do) and they effectively block out conversations and distractions in a variety of languages and dialects.  I give them two thumbs up and am buying a couple more pairs so I can have them on hand perchance I misplace this pair.

They are getting worse and worse I swear. I should buy the warranty but I always forget. I think I should just invest in better earbuds. And not those airpods crap - there is no way people can not not lose them.

Now, I'm treat my earbuds so well, yet they still die on me. Are all the affordable earbuds just total garbage? I heard that Beats by Dr. Dre only cost $14 to make, yet are sold for like $200.

So far, these do not disappoint!

With almost all other earbuds, I find that If they start out fitting nicely and working well, something usually breaks down; the fit gets messed up, which either degrades the seal between the earbud and the ear and reduces the sound quality by a lot, or becomes physically uncomfortable. If not that. Not with these.

With other earbuds,  there may be moments where the fit and sound are excellent ...but then I cough, chew, smile, or do something totally normal, and at least one earbud slips out. Not with these.

The sound quality, most likely due to the excellent seal within the ear, is exceptional for something at this price range. clear, rich sound, with decent bass!

The weight is so slight, that I hardy feel them at all.

They’re also relatively comfortable to wear while laying down, meditating, side-sleeping, etc.

Soon as I experienced these earbuds, I bought a second set, and a set for my mom.

Excellent value!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Byers","Panasonic RPHJE120K In-Ear Headphone: Great once you learn how to wear them","March 22, 2016","I've had a love/hate relationship with these earbuds until I learned how to properly use them (I've had them for a few weeks now). These are my first pair of in-ear earbuds and as many have already said, they are to be worn sealed into the ear canal to get the proper fidelity. You cannot simply fit them into the opening of the ear and get any bass response at all. I knew this but didn't know how you were supposed to get them inserted properly and I struggled in the absence of any pertinent guidance. I understand that everyone's ears are shaped a little differently but what I found that worked for me was to insert the bud into the opening of my ear canal and rotate it while applying inward pressure (kind of like turning a screw) until the cable/shaft points upwards (see my pic). When the bud is situated this way it slides into my ear canal and makes the appropriate seal and I can run the cable behind my ear. No amount of inward pressure could get the proper seal with the cables hanging downward like you would think it is intended.  It took me a while to figure this out. I also discovered that there is a fine line between pushing it in just enough to create the seal and pushing it in too far. Go too far and they begin to hurt rather quickly... and they hurt pretty bad. So find the spot where they seal but go no further. Again, it took me a while to figure this out. When positioned correctly I can wear them for extended periods.

That being said, once fitted correctly - sealed in the ear canal - these buds provide an adequate (quite a bit actually) amount of bass and sound isolation compared to the regular headphones that simply rest in front of the ear opening. The bass was too much at first. I realized I had my EQ settings on my device set to a high bass boost to compensate for my old headphones. Once adjusted to flatten out the bass they sounded fantastic.

I've never had any other high-end earbuds to compare these to but I feel that these sound great especially for the price. They do a very good job of keeping out surrounding noise. I used them on a recent flight and they did a MUCH better job keeping out the background noise of the jet than my old phones. Use caution when walking/running as they can block the sound of traffic and other hazards you would otherwise hear.

Summary: These Panasonic in-ear earbuds are a great value and have exceptional sound... once you learn how to properly use them. Experiment to achieve the correct and comfortable fit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

When I tried listening to them the sound in the right ear kept shorting out.  Went to Amazon to try to return them and learned I could not return them even though I had just purchased them a few days ago.  Instead I was given the phone number to Panasonic customer support.  I was disconnected twice from customer  support while they tried to transfer me to the right person.  I realize these headphones we’re only $8 but it’s the principle of it that they make you jump through all of these hoops from the manufacturer to return a defective product. Normally Amazon returns items quickly with little effort.  Given all of the positive reviews of these headphones I am assuming I just got a defective pair.
UPDATE:  I called Panasonic to start a return. They told me I would have to ship the $8 earbuds to them first then they would fix them and send them back to me. Very disappointed as it would cost me at least that much to ship them in the first place.

The problem is that in order to get that deep, rich audio - particularly bass response - these have to be really well-embedded in your ear, and these are so painful to wear that it's borderline intolerable.  And that's surprising, because Panasonic is a company I generally trust to produce great stuff.

These are all hard edges and unyielding, bone-crunching solidity where there should be soft-as-a-pillow comfort, and a veritable 3D geometry puzzle of angles and tangents and things evocative of the proverbial dog's hind leg where a simple straight line would be fine.

They're hard to get far enough into your ear because of that big disc-shaped thing in the middle of the horizontal axis; they hurt like hell all the way in because the pads that are supposed to provide cushion between the plastic and your living tissue are both small and thin; and they're hard to keep in your ear once they're there (assuming you've chosen to grit your teeth and take the pain for the sake of music,) because the business end that houses the actual speaker is too small in diameter and too short in extent to get any useful friction - particularly when that big disc thing is snugged up against your dorsal metamoglopsolesis or whatever it's called, which is pushing it in the opposite direction, namely: out.

Lest you assume I have abnormal ears, I've used dozens of different earbuds and earphones and roughly half of them feel better in your ear than nothing at all.  'Don't know about Panasonic's other models, but this one is just a mechanical design gaffe.

Believe it or not, some of the best-sounding - and most comfortable - earbuds I've come across are the pairs that come with the Roku streaming TV units.  I hadn't noticed until I heard some good, punchy rock in some movie soundtrack or other, was duly shocked at the audio quality, and tried them with my MP3 player.  I like them so much that I went to the Roku site and bought a three-pack of them. [And no, I'm in no way affiliated with Roku and nobody is paying me to say this.  'Just the facts, ma'am.]

So unless you've got a high tolerance for pain, stay away from these.  Yes, they're dirt cheap, but... they hurt like hell.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Over the years, I have preferred closed-back Sennheiser headphones as open-backs annoy my wife if she's watching tv while I'm listening to music or an audiobook in the same room and buds won't stay in my ears. The only time I use earbuds is when I'm working outside, mowing the lawn, etc. and I always had to wear shooter muffs over them, not only to reduce the noise, but to keep the stupid earbuds from falling-out of my ears while I worked.

I like these angled buds. Upon putting these earbuds in and plugging them into an early iPod Nano, the first thing I noticed was that they didn't fall out of my ears every time I moved and my wife can't hear them when I'm sitting on the other side of the sofa. I also tested them mowing the lawn and trimming hedges without shooter muffs and they stayed in and sounded great.

I can't speak to audiophiles about range, and whatever, as I have some high & low range hearing loss, but I will say that when listening to mp3s on my iPod from Brubeck, to Billie Holiday to Irish Punk and an audiobook of The Count of Monte Cristo, they all sounded great. I even jacked them into my pc speaker for a few minutes of Oblivion.

The sound quality is great (others have written about it more extensively- good base notes, balanced sound). Only in the last few WEEKS (after 3.5 years!) has the cord started to become a bit testy, forcing me to be careful to keep it at just the right angle to get sound in both ears. BUT I think that's MY fault -- in 3.5 years I've put these headphones through a lot! They've snagged on things and been pulled out of my ears, dropped to the ground with my phone at the gym, had textbooks piled on top of them in my backpack, and so much more. They're just so good for the price point. I accidentally left these at home before heading on a road trip and bought headphones at a rest area for $15 that weren't one-tenth as good as these. (I still regret it to this day.) In addition to delivering great sound, the material the earbuds are made of is comfortable (earbud plastic is NOT created equal) and of the three sizes I was able to find one that fits my ear perfectly.

You will not find another pair of earbuds or headphones at this price that will have anything close to this level of sound quality. You'll have to get to the $40+ range before other earbud sound quality becomes more comparable.

You plug it into your phone, tablet, or computer and you listen to a song or video, you'll get probably one of worst sound qualities you can imagine. It can pick up sounds like instrumentals decently, although you'll hear some feedback and static. But when it comes to vocals, for whatever reason the headphones decide to not pick it up or lower the voices to such a low level, it becomes incredibly hard to hear. My advice is if you just need it to listen to basic sounds, the price is very cheap.

**UPDATED REVIEW BELOW**

I just have to say WOW, I had to spread the word on these guys. I am super impressed with these earbuds. If you told me that I could have a pair of earbuds that sounded great, did not distort any sound, were comfortable, looked decent, and they were only 8 dollars, I WOULD SLAP YOU AND CALL YOU A LIAR!! I would be severely mistaken however (and arrested), as I am dead wrong.

I had read reviews on a couple of different websites that these were the El Dorado of earbuds under 50 dollars. Some were so brave as to exclaim that these were the best earbuds under 100 dollars. I then found 33,000 reviews on Amazon with the overwhelming majority saying that these are THE best cheap earbud to get. These brash claims caught my attention, and as a gadget guru and headphone enthusiast, I had no choice but to succumb to the lavish price of 8 dollars.

For those interested in a breakdown: these come with three sets of eartips, which I had to play with because I could not find the right size at first. Making sure you have the right size ear tips in is CRUCIAL, because it will form a seal around your ear and you will be able to isolate and block external noise better, hear the music louder and clearer, and the bass will be more prominent. I have had these for a week so far and have used them for a multitude of things.

 I’ve watched movies, listened to music while mowing the lawn (these were sufficient at for drowning out most noise), worked out with them, and used them for playing games. The best things I would recommend them for are for just casually listening to music and watching movies. This is my general test on how good headphones are: Play Rage Against the Machine and see if I can get pumped up on the bass, then play I Saw Her Standing There by The Beatles and see if I can hear George Harrison twanging away on his guitar over Paul McCartney’s overpowering bass. These definitely beat a lot of over the ear headphones that I own. The sound is balanced and I could hear everything almost exactly like the original audio recording.  They also had a reasonable audio level and got as loud as I needed them before I hit the highest setting.

I would not recommend these for working out, as they just kept falling out of my ears and distracting me while I was running.I also would say that these are not an acceptable headphone for FPS or multiplayer gaming, as you really need an over the ear set to amp up all the noise in the game and help give you directional listening. I could not pinpoint footsteps / etc. with these earbuds as well as with my Audio Technica and Polk Headsets. Also, you need a decent mic for voice chat and this model does not have a mic. Generally though, these are worth it for everything else mentioned.

So, here I am. Telling you to get these. Get them now. Don’t hesitate.

**TL/DR: 8 Dollar headphones, why you not buy?**

**PRODUCT UPDATE 08/14/16** 5 stars dropped to 3
What am I doing up at 1247am on a Sunday? One may answer that I am at a club having a great time, or watching a movie with my fiance, or having a sleepover with my family, but the answer to that question is none of the above. I am awake at this hour as your sworn headphone avenger, to tell you not to buy these headphones. You should buy these headphones instead: JVC HAFX5B Gumy Plus Inner Ear Headphones -Black

Why? Because I was a bit over zealous on my initial review. At the time of writing the original review, I had not found a suitable alternative for a cheap and reasonably decent sounding pair of headphones. But - just like all politicians, at some point when you make a public statement you have to back track when you're mouth was moving faster than your brain.

I bought the JVC Gumy headphones from Best Buy a few weeks ago and I was intending to test them side by side with the Panasonic Ergofits. I noticed some immediate improvements that the JVCs had over the Panasonics. One was that the gummy seals for your ear are a lot more comfortable. secure, and provide a much better seal than the Panasonics did. The next improvement was the mic and control button(which the upgraded ergofit has, but you shouldn't go without it). The most important feature that the JVCs have over the Panasonic is its performance. When I listened to One More Time by Daft Punk on both headphones, the Panasonics were very level all around and there was nothing spectacular that stood out. When I used the JVCs, my ears exploded with delight from the much better bass response it had. I have been using the JVCs for everything since then and I haven't looked back.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The thing that disturbs me is this recent pair I got sounded like some cheap Walmart crap, I don't know if it was a single defective pair or because this is the #1 rated earbud that they are now choosing to lower the manufacturing quality.

I bought a set of these and a set of JVC HAFX at the same time.

My first impression of these on my ipod 3 was, damn they're shrill! But then I remembered my wife used my ipod when she went for her walk the day before so I adjusted the treble and these sounded pretty good. Then I took them out and plugged in the JVC buds. My first impression was damn they're shrill! I checked the settings and turned the treble most of the way down, on the same song, Cannonball by Supertramp, and listened to the whole song, every time the cymbals were hit, it felt like they were the main instrument in the band, even when I turned the treble off, midrange down and the bass up, they were still shrill!

So I kept the Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds and put the JVC's in a drawer in case of emergency but it would have to be an extreme emergency! Just to be sure, I bought my wife a pair in grey so she can lie in bed at night and listen to a movie on her ipad. That way if mine ever break, um, babe, take these JVC buds, you'll love them and I'm sure she will because she loves extreme treble. But really these are the best on Amazon! I bought Skullcandy, they lasted a month because when I take mine off, I wrap them around my ipod and toss them onto the floor where the charger is. And yet with both my wife and I abusing the same pair, turning the ipod all the way to 100% all the time and me tossing them on the floor, these have lasted me over a year! I actually bought this pair Dec 12th 2004!

I love them so much that I'm going to get a set with the microphone because we just bought a smartphone so I'm getting a 128 gb card and putting all the music on there so I can ditch the ipod and free up some pocket room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are replacing a set of Sony earbuds in a similar price range.  Like the Sony pairs, they will not last long.  The sound quality and overall functionality are also similar.  These buds lack grommets where the wire enters and it's almost certain to be a failure point.  Even the strain of pulling them out of the excessive packaging risks a short.  The cable holds a coil very well and will likely never lay flat - having a cord constantly tickling my neck or cheek makes these much less comfortable than the cheap Sony devices.  And lastly, the plastic cups that you stick into your ears are made from a gummy material that attracts small particles like dust and lint.  I would not recommend using these devices for stow and go scenarios unless you carry them in a Ziploc or something.  Otherwise, you're going to be introducing a LOT of foreign materials into your ear.  Although the driver is ovoid, the little cups have round openings; swapping them out is tremendously difficult.  The stock cup on one earbud I received had a tear in it and had to be replaced before use.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

My primary function for these is gaming on the Xbox.  No echo with the mic (unless accidentally blasting sound through the TV) and the volume is perfect.  Bass and treble are average per cheaper cellphone headphones.  I recently purchased the HyperX Cloud Pro Gaming Headset due to in-ear bud discomfort, and there wasn't a very large difference in sound quality.  The HyperX is definitely more crisp with regards to the tone and carries about the same in bass, but other than that.... not much better overall.  For ten times less I'd recommend the Panasonic over more expensive over-the-ear headphone/mic combos.  My only gripe is the discomfort of in-ear buds over a long duration of use.  It must be noted that the shape of the bud is oval, not round.  I don't believe this makes a large difference in comfort for me, but it may for you.

If you want high quality sound from headphones I recommend doing some serious research (if you're reading this, you're already on the path.)

They work in all my portable devices without fail and do the job they're supposed to do.

I have heard some complaints about sound quality such as bass and hearing all the sounds in the music. These are valid criticisms I agree. However, I have headphones for my hi-fi so if I want to listen to music. I have my expensive headphones just for that. When I need a pair of reliable, cheap headphones to listen to a podcast to pass the time, laugh at comedy album, enjoy an audio book, or listen to music on a portable device while I take a hike these are great! If I want to sit down and really listen to an album I'm not going to be moving around and likely will be in my home. In those situations I won't be grabbing these. You want higher quality for sound you're going to have to pay more than $10. For my on the go needs these get the job done. They work with my iPod and my Kindle just like they're supposed to and they are very durable.

Also, I would like to add that the ear buds fit nicely into my ear. They are able to drown out excess sound when you need them for that. I live in a noisy area near train tracks and my neighborhood has lots of kids enjoying play loudly outside. Whether it's lawnmowers, motor cycles, or any noises typical to the city neighborhood I can crank up some white noise on my laptop, kindle, or iPod then use these to enjoy a book or even take a nap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The best rivals to these under the $50 range are earbuds available mostly in China (although they are also on Amazon). Ones such as Xiaomi and Vsonic, however, reliability on those is hit or miss. You don't want to spend $40 on a pair of earbuds end up being defective trash, so in my opinion these Panasonics are pretty good.

Although it's hard to expect perfect build quality on a $12 item, the pairs that I've owned have held up well. The biggest issue will be the lack of strain relief, so the part where the wire connects into the earbud is almost always likely be the cause of the demise of these earbuds.

For the money they are great.

If you have a tin ear these might please you. Tinny doesn't even begin to describe their sound..The crappiest headphones I have ever purchased. I read a review on CNET that these were great and had great bass sound. Nothing could be farther from the truth. They sound like music in a tin can. Extremely bright treble crashes on your ear drums like clattering silverware on a marble floor. Using the EQ doesn't help much at all. Don't buy these unless you have no ear for quality sound and hate anything non treble.
UPDATE: I have found that using the largest silicone cushions greatly enhances the quality of sound. So I have upgraded from one star to five. The bass came forward way, way more when I used the larger cushions. I should have remembered that from my last set of buds that used fitted silicone cushions. Also, I put the buds in my ears according to their marked position which required a magnifying glass and strong light to see on the back of each bud. Panasonic needs to color in the L and R to be more visible. Yes, these are much more comfortable than the Apple earbuds, but not yet ready to say they sound better. I still feel they are too bright on treble, but I am way more happier with them now. Well worth the few bucks in comparison to Apple's pricing.

And you may have different results than I did, but I had two problems with it.

First, the cord developed a short within the first 40 days of ownership. I use it several times a week, and I'm using it while trail running, so the unit gets bounced around a bit. Still… 40 days? I've had other headphones I use while trail running that have lasted two or three years.  I personally mind if the sound cuts out occasionally, so I had to downgrade this one considerably for value. A $50 headset that lasts two years is actually cheaper than a $10 headset that lasts less than two months.

Second, I've never been able to get a solid fit with the earpiece design. I've tried different sizes of the earbuds, but not been able to get them to stay in place, unless I physically hold them with my hands into my ear canals.

Raphaelson","Best cheap earbuds I've used","June 14, 2019","I've been through a bunch of earbuds in the $10 to $50 range, and these have by far the best sound quality of any of them. They're not audiophile 'phones any means. They don't have much treble extension, or ""air,"" and the bass is a bit indistinct (but warm and reasonably full, without being exaggerated, like in all the horrible Bose and Beats consumer products). But anyway, I get these for running and for the gym, where they will be thrashed and sweated on and broken, or possibly just lost. So the price is right.

My only gripe is that they're fragile. For the sound quality, and a bit more durability, I'd happily pay twice as much. Which is why I now buy two pairs at a time. Which is an ok solution, but wasteful. And yes, I've looked at buds that cost twice or three times as much ... they look equally flimsy.

Why all the one-star reviews? Probably inconsistent quality control. Which is not surprising at the price point. I've just been lucky so far. If you get these and they sound bad out of the box, or if they break right away, you got a lemon. Send back and maybe give them a 2nd chance.

Here's a tip if you're using these for running or the gym: get the ones without the mic. The mic/volume button assembly isn't even a little bit water resistant. As soon as you sweat on it, your music will start skipping and going crazy, like your phone's taken over by a poltergeist. I've fixed by covering the mic/buttons with duct tape. For the next pair I was going to fix with shrink tubing, but then saw they make (for even cheaper!) a mic-free version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've had them for about a week so far. I'm pleased.

The shape of the ear bud is a little weird, but it is shaped to your ear. The package came with two additional rubber ear bud ends if your ear is smaller or bigger than the set already on. I've been okay with the standard set so far. There have been a few times when I felt like they were slipping out but overall it is fine. I've used them around the house casually and have used them while speed walking around the park. One of the days when I did use them in the park on a windy day, I thought they were going to fall out a couple times.

I had a pair for YEARS with no problems but I lost them, which caused me much emotional turmoil. Bought a new pair but upgraded to the ones with the mic, which is a game changer. I can now browse adult content on my computer and use both my hands while talking to customer service reps from Spectrum.

The earbuds run a little small, so I use the biggest size on my average size ears. They fit pretty snugly, but still could be a little bigger.

The sound is FANTASTIC for the $10 price tag. I actually got rid of my Beats by Dre and use these instead. They don't cancel out all sound but they drown out a good amount. With a little audio EQ, the sound is crisp, with good mids, highs, and bass.

The cord is a LITTLE flimsy, but the first pair lasted so damn long that I have faith in it.

They do go rather deep into one’s ear, which is probably good for noise cancelling (I’m just not used to it.)

My two drawbacks are the thinness of the cord (worryingly thin.... I foresee tangles and fraying) and the plug.  Unlike the straight plug/jack on Apple headphones, this has one of those bent jacks that look very old-fashioned and are just asking to get bumped out of your phone somehow.

That being said, I am sure they will do the job I’m asking of them.  At this price, if they last well for at least a year I’m sure I’ve gotten more than a bargain.

Update:  After having these for a week or two, I've decided I don't like them.  I usually spend this much on ear buds and they hold up better; the left ear bud fades in and out as the wire moves.  I also don't like how the microphone button does not have a volume control.

Another con for me was that archaically big wire jack.  It's in the way if you use these with your phone, so actually using your phone while having head phones in is difficult.

Their one good feature is the comfort, but for me it isn't worth it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've run my phones amplified, un-amplified, through my Dragonfly DAC, straight from the laptop's line out, from multiple phones and media players. Long story short, I do possess the ability to provide an educated opinion on whether a pair of buds should be worth buying and which shouldn't be.

And you know what the real shocker is? Hand over fist, I'd recommend these Panasonics over just about any pair of earbuds under 50 bucks. There are a few exceptions in the budget arena, such as the Xiaomi Piston II and Forte Life S which excel in their own rights, but as an all-rounder these really can't be beat. They're ridiculously comfortable, seal very quickly (though they could stand to come with another pair of slightly larger silicone tips for listeners with Viking-sized ears...very few people will need this option), offer a very pleasant sound signature, and (maybe most important) has a price point that makes it a serious contender in the budget arena.

As far as the sound signature is concerned, I feel safe in saying they were tailored to the average consumer. First, there's definitely plenty of bass. Much like the Forte Life S, it's hard to look at the size of these things and expect them to dig down towards the sub-bass regions. Granted, it's not going to give you the sensation of strapping a subwoofer to your skull, but they shouldn't leave you lacking, either. Next, there's a healthy amount of midrange and listeners of the majority of rock subgenres should feel very happy. Electric guitars have a definitely advantage here and there's a lot of meat in tracks like Crossfade's ""Washing the World Away"" or Dark New Day's ""Brother."" Finally, at the top, you get a smooth yet (in my humble opinion) premature rolloff. Perhaps in an attempt to tame the typical sibilance of most consumer-level headphones, they thought an early rolloff would be an advantage and most listeners certainly won't complain. There are those, however, who will want a pair with more ""sparkle,"" in which case I'd suggest doubling your investment and going with either the Xiaomi or Forte.

As far as fit and comfort are concerned, I have zero complaints. If there ever was a straight drop-in solution, Panasonic has things on lock. I don't find myself needing to perform intricate maneuvers like pulling my ear lobes back (a la Etymotic) or twist-locking (Yurbuds is notorious for this). Instead, I get an immediate seal without feeling like I'm putting undue pressure at any point. I can see these providing hours upon hours of comfortable use.

Final notes:

The remote and built-in mic work as intended, though only has a singular button for accepting/ending calls vice separate volume controls (most likely to assist with cross-compatibility between Apple and Android devices). I can't speak much on durability as these have only been unboxed for a few hours, but will do my best to update after I run them through the gamut that is your typical submarine underway period. Cord length feels more than adequate without feeling like I have far more than I need. For your person of 5'10-6' tall, you'll be fine keeping these plugged in and storing your media device in your pants pocket. The 45-degree termination for the headphone jack should help provide the necessary strain relief and the jack itself is skinny enough that it shouldn't have an issue with phone cases that don't offer a healthy opening for headphones.

TL;DR: These Panasonics should be a MUST OWN for anyone concerned with good sound. Are they a replacement for my Shures or Etymotics? In a way, yes. I can pay 20 bucks for these and replace as necessary without worry in a more rugged environment. Still, if pristine sound quality or a truly flat signature is your concern, these probably aren't the way to go and you're probably not looking at the $20 price bracket. I feel comfortable in saying that you'd really have to more than double your budget to attain that goal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These earbuds are the pure utility, throw away and don't worry sort of ear buds I always wanted but quality is NOT sacrificed. I use my ear buds all the time. I run and work out with them, sometimes I fall asleep listening to music with them (then of course you get tangled up in them by the time you wake up). I've gotten them stuck on something in my backpack and gave them a good yank to free them. Basically, a lot of things you really shouldn't do with ear buds and things I would be horrified to try with earbuds that cost more than these bad mamba jamas.

If you want quality sound, you probably aren't looking for these and really should be perusing the Senheiser and up with the audiophiles. But the sound out of these is still what I would call ""really good"". Bass is bass and and treble is treble.

To anyone who wants versatile, cheap, throw-away ear buds, these should be in your shopping cart now. Good sound, good comfort, good price and if you lose them or tie them in a knot, so be it.

The only con is there is no integrated microphone or audio controls but that is a trade I am MORE than willing to accept. These are your basic barebones, ear buds.

I also have small ears so I have a hard tome finding comfortable earbuds that fit and don’t hurt. I had a cheap pair from a store that broke and they didn’t have them in stock when I went. I started using the earbuds that came with my iPhone but those are the most godawful uncomfortable things ever- I don’t know how anyone uses them. So I found these for under $10 and figured what the heck. They came today and I am very happy with them. First pro the price of course. At this price I wouldn’t be upset if I lost them or one of my kids/dog destroyed them or if they don’t last long. Second pro is the fit. As I said I have small ears, so I usually look for earbuds that come with multiple sizes and use the smallest ones. With these, the smallest ones are a actually a tiny bit too small. So parents looking for earbuds for kids, or anyone with small ears, these are a great choice. Third pro is comfort. They are surprisingly more comfortable than I expected and stay in my ear well without falling out or putting too much pressure on my ears, even when laying on side. I haven’t worked out in them but I think they would be good for that as they stay in and are comfortable. Fourth pro is the sound quality which is pretty good as well. The noise cancellation isn’t great as I can still faintly hear my husband snoring lol but I honestly didn’t have high hopes given the price, and that’s not really an important factor for me anyway. All in all these are great.

N.","I've been using this brand for 3 years, and the quality has sharply declined","October 17, 2019","I first bought a pair of these 3 years ago and was amazed at the quality of sound, especially for the price. They were clear and balanced, not too bass heavy or distorted like so many cheap headphones are. And they lasted for over a year before the sound went out in one ear, which is pretty good. I listen to music for several hours a day so most headphones in t price range don’t last beyond a few months. I bought a couple more pairs and enjoyed them very much for the next 2 years, until my new kitten ruined them by chewing through the cords.

I bought another pair and waited patiently for them to arrive. It was really hard working without music for several days, and so I was beyond excited when I checked my mailbox to see they had arrived. My excitement didn’t last. As soon as I put them on, I realized the sound quality had declined significantly from the previous pairs. The bass is too loud now and the treble notes buzz and crackle in a way that hurts my ears at normal volumes. And the left ear keeps going in an out, requiring me to adjust it and wiggle the cord frequently. I doubt they’ll last long at all, and seeing so many other similar recent reviews has really made me sad.

I don't play nice with my earbuds - they're almost constantly plugged into my phone, even when I'm not using them. I know you're not supposed to wrap your earbuds around your phone, but that's really the only way I store them (whoops). Usually they break at the end of the wire, near the jack. There was once where the plastic part of the earbud itself popped out.

I'm not especially picky about sound quality - I can tell when an audio file was ripped off YouTube, but that's about it. I AM, however, really picky about fit. Most earbuds and headphones cause too much pressure in my ears and can make me feel nauseated. These earbuds fit comfortably and don't cause any pressure. That's honestly the main reason why I've purchased these year after year. I've tried high end earbuds ($30-100), and none of them fit as comfortably as these.

I originally bought a green pair (because it was the only color on sale at the time) to try these out and I ended up loving them.

The first thing I noticed was how nicely it fits in the ear.
It's snug, but not uncomfortable by any means.
You do have to make sure that you're putting the correct bud in the proper ear, of course, or else they'll be uncomfortable.
They're angled a bit so that you can't wear the left bud in the right ear or the right bud in the left ear - this makes for a better fit overall, though.

I came back and bought a couple more pairs (in black, orange, and blue) after my wife and I began fighting over who got the ""good earbuds"" while working out at the gym together.
Now, these aren't $50 earbuds, so when I say the quality is good, I mean it's notably good considering the price.
I like how the fit of these seems to help keep outside noises out - such as people running on the treadmill, for example - and allows me to just lose myself to my music.

The sound quality is pretty good - not ""tinny"" like many cheap earbuds tend to be.
I heard some people complain about the lack of base, but I didn't really notice to be honest - maybe because the music I listen to isn't super base heavy?  If you're listening to dub-step, I suppose these wouldn't be the best for that.
I listen to mostly alternative rock and pop, and I've had no issues with feeling that any part of the sound quality was lacking in any real, noticeable way.

Beyond the great fit and good quality, the price is probably the biggest selling point here.
For about $8 a pair, this is a real steal.
The only thing left to do is to see how long they hold up in the long run.

Plus, I like the selective range of bright colors - makes spotting them 10x easier when you could have SWORN you put them right there, but of course you didn't, haha.  Plus they have orange, my favorite color, so yanno.  Little biased there.  Just a little.

Final line, if you're wearing these on a plane, bus, out jogging, or at the gym, these are pretty great.
If you're used to $50+ earbuds in general, these might not be for you.
If you're a gamer and rely on pinpoint sound accuracy, these also may not be for you.

A few months ago I lost that pair, so I reordered the exact same version, and it showed up in the same packaging, but immediately I could tell that the wire was much flimsier than the original set, and when I tested them out, the sound jack was loose, so I could only hear bits and pieces of music unless I physically pressed the jack into my phone at *just* the right angle and held it there, and the slightest wiggle or twist of the jack would cause the sound to cut out or distort (it was completely impossible to work out with them). I returned those and ordered a replacement set, which did work, although yet again the materials and the cord seemed much flimsier than my original set. Also, it's been just a few months since I got these and they're already starting to distort and cut out just like the pair that I returned, so now I'm only using them in situations when I'm sitting and not moving at all (though they still cut out sometimes anyway!)

Weber","Best earbuds I've ever owned, period.","May 21, 2019","These are hands-down the best earbuds I've ever owned. Tl;dr: they're insanely cheap, comfortable (even for side-sleeping), sound great, and durable as hell. I 100% recommend these. Read on for the longer version.

I used to go through a pair of earbuds about every 9 months to a year. One ear would quit working, a cord would break or pull out, etc.. I'm not super careful with earbuds--I keep them in my pocket, occasionally drop them, get them damp, things like that. However, these buds lasted me a year and a half, working perfectly the whole time. The only reason I had to get a new pair is because my old ones got run over in a parking lot. And they still sort of worked! Despite being literally in pieces, sound came out of both buds and the remote button still worked. I was genuinely gutted when they broke because I was afraid they wouldn't still be available--thank god they are!

Other than amazing durability, these are just all-around quality headphones.

First, they're comfy. I regularly sleep (on my side) in them, and I almost never wake up with sore ears. They're also usually still in when I wake up in the morning. These are the first buds I've seen that had the actual speakers (like, the part inside the rubber tips) shaped to fit the ears. Most are circles, these are ovals. This would probably also make them comfy for small-eared folks.

I'm no true audiophile, so I can't comment on the specifics of the sound quality. But for my purposes, the sound is great. It's crisp, the bass is pretty strong, and the volume range is good. The noise isolation is also pretty darn impressive. (These are noise-isolating, not noise-cancelling, to be clear.)

Another little thing I find handy is the right-angled connector. My audio jack is on the bottom of my phone, so this lets me rest it on things without feeling like I'm breaking the cable. It also makes it harder to accidentally catch on things.

The only negative thing I have to say about these is that I really wish the mic/remote had volume controls. It does have one ""universal"" button, so you can accept and end calls, pause music, skip tracks, etc., but it's annoying to have to pick up my whole phone to change the volume.

I guess for some another negative might be the looks. They're very plain, plastic, not flashy. Personally, that doesn't matter much to me. And apparently they do offer some color options, if that's your thing.

In sum, these are fantastic. For under $15, you really can't beat them. I'll definitely be repurchasing (if I ever need to).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Also, I've accidentally tugged on wires NUMEROUS times and it still works perfectly fine and when I store it, I like to knot is to keep it from getting tangled and just throw it in my bag pocket. (I've attached a picture)
It also comes with 2 extra pairs of earbud tips in case you need one smaller or bigger than the one it comes with. (or if you lose one!)

The static in these are getting worse. I can no longer play music on low because the static is louder then the music and voices.

Have to wait till next paycheck and then getting ear buds from a different company and these are going in the trash can.

I read people complaining about no white noise. They should have the earbuds I bought. Every times music plays there is annoying background noise. It is like listening to old speakers that you know are dying. I tried it on different devices and the noise it there all the times when sounds are coming through. Also the second day I was listening to them, the right earbud will not play on my computer and it plays softer on my cellphone in the right earbud. When I take them out after wearing them for a while. The package was sealed so I know I didn't get a used product but they are very defective.

I was primarily looking for a set that would perpetually remain at the office, and not knowing is a sticky fingers might roam the halls, I didn't want to spend too much. After some searching, comparing other brands, I decided get these for that sole purpose.

Overall, I'm happy with the purchase, they're a decent pair of headphones for the price. I opted for the one without the microphone, since certain places at work would no allow them if they had a mic.

I was skeptical about the whole ""ergo"" design of them, especially when I took them out of the package and noticed their weird shape, but those fears turned out to be unfounded. These headphones are comfortable to wear, more so that they any other in-ear pairs I owned over the years. I've owned some that felt more like earplugs, while these just rest in the ear without slipping out.

I think it's this ergo, comfort fit, that might explain my only criticism with these, and that's the sound quality, they're muted sounding. My stock Samsung headphones were quite loud, and I barely needed to have the volume high to hear sound out of them, these are the opposite. The the quality of sound coming out of them is still good, I find I have to raise the volume higher on phone just to hear what's being played. I'm not sure if this is normal for them, of a side effect from ""ergo"" design, but felt it worth mentioning. Either way, I'm still happy with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I don't expect miracles from such cheap ear buds but the sound quality from this latest pair was so unacceptable that I wondered if they were a counterfeit product.  The first two pairs (identical models) I bought had such differing frequency responses that I assumed that the factory slaps whatever the cheapest drivers are on the wholesale market at the moment inside without any consideration at all regarding quality.  I think I was correct.  This latest pair was so sibilant that they were irritating, even at low volumes.  To add insult to injury, the left ear had an intermittent connection right out of the box, and each wire was able to move freely in and out of the housing, meaning that the weight of the wires is likely supported by the solder joints (pure junk).

I'm not an audiophile and don't know what I'm talking about. Also not everybody's ears are shaped like mine.

I have bought 9 pairs of these headphones going back to 2014, back when they were Wirecutter's recommended earbuds under $50. They have since lost that title. However, I tried those and I still buy and use these ones instead. Here's why:

Pros:
- And I cannot emphasize enough - they are actually shaped like the HUMAN EAR. The silicone insert is oval, like your ear canal. It is angled forward, like your ear canal. Why most earbuds are still shaped like a can of soda and fall out of your very not-can-shaped ears, I will never know. Maybe it's a patent thing?
- Audio quality is good. Super low bass drops off a bit, but normal bass is great. Mids can dominate the highs, but let's be honest most of us are listening to Spotify at ""Normal"" audio quality with lots of ambient noise around. If I wanted to hear the sound of the dude's shirt rustling as he lifts the arm to play the first note I'd buy open-backs and a DAC.
- $10 is a steal. I keep them everywhere, and have given them away when someone needs some. I have one at my desk, one in my pocket, a backup one in my bag, and one in its box for when another one breaks, and oh yeah-
- They don't break. Of 9 pairs, only one that I used almost every day for 3 years eventually separated the cone part with the cord from the angled part with the earpiece (sealant stopped working because I probably accidentally yanked it out of my ears one too many times from dropping something it was plugged in to and I jog too much). I was traveling (with a backup pair!), but if I had super glue one drop would have fixed it for probably another 3 years.

Cons:
- These were released 6 years ago and nobody has released anything competitive that I've tried near this price point. I've tried $100 earbuds that aren't shaped ergonomically with barely noticeable audio quality change, and still come back to these. Who knows, maybe one day soon I'll take a leap and splurge and spend $13 on those new Betron BS10's which look similar and boast better audio. They don't have a mic though :).
- Maybe minor improvements to durability or audio quality but at 10 bucks who cares.
- Could use some volume up down buttons on the mic thing, but haven't noticed it much, usually easy to change using phone volume buttons in my pocket.
- They aren't Aipods. Fortunately, I can buy 16 of these for the price of Airpods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Battey","The single best cheap investment to upgrade your entire music library!","July 30, 2018","It seems like a waste to pile on another review of these fantastic earbuds. After all what's let to say after some 20,000 other people have weighed in on their quality? Just this-these are the SINGLE BEST INVESTMENT I HAVE EVER MADE IN High-Fi sound. I have a $1300 Oppo CD player, $900 amp & $1,000 speakers. Together they don't sound better than these puny earbuds & an IPod! They deliver deliver terrific soundstage, instrumental nuances and subtleties I've never gotten from my $3200 stereo, Just to cite a few examples from listening to my favorite band the Rolling Stones-the cymbals & snare in It's All Over Now are analog-record real, the bass has a fat tuba sound and Mick's voice sounds as clear as if he was singing in an isolation booth. On Satisfaction I noticed double tracked acoustic guitar strumming I barely sensed before. I have no doubt you can spend more and get even better sound but come on-around $10 for something that is GENUINELY immersive?
Two obvious hints-these ARE delicate buds-handle them with care & they'll provide years of pleasure but they're not abuse proof. Secondly I'd recommend installing the largest earpads & sticking the buds as deep in your ears as is comfortable and you'll get a great seal and phenomenal sound.

The mic seems to work just fine; I use it for business calls and recording my voice and it's about as good as any earbud mic. Only flaw is that they do not have a volume control - there is one button on the mic piece and that just stops and starts the music. I love the bright blue color, as it makes them easy to find in my bag. The angled jack means less stress on the cord, which is essential, since that’s where most earbud cords break.

To date, I've never heard such beautiful sounds come from any device. They must be crazy to sell these for under 20 dollars! I almost cry listening to the rich sounds. To be clear this is not hype. If you every meet me irl, I'm very picky about my music quality.

Honestly, I've put a few through the washer and ruined them. But they still sound better broken then other's in this price range. Don't believe me. Buy these and find out! I've tried so many different brands and models with my music, and dare I say it's on par or better than Bose!

Most earphone I run across sound muffled or have too much bass. These find the right balance and fit all genres of music whether it's house, funk, classical, hip-hop, or pony. Please stop reading this and buy some already. You'll thank me later! Do it!

As a bonus, I love the built in mic and button so I can skip songs. It's something you get used to and can't live without.

I watched half of a movie on my laptop, switched them to my MP3 and walked 3 miles, did a little stretching then put them on my dresser...the next morning I started my MP3 and the sound in the left ear kept going in and out, I checked to make sure the jack was plugged in all the way and as soon as I touched it the sound came back but when I let go it went out in the left ear again.

YAY! Finally a pair of earbuds that don't hurt my ears... Not sure why it is, maybe I have small ears, but I frequently have problems with earbuds hurting after wearing them for only a minute or two.

I can't speak for their ability to stand up to daily use as I haven't had them long, but if they fail I'll come back with an update.

I mostly bought these because people said they're durable, but first impression is: the cord feels thin and cheap, so I'm not so sure about that, but I can't judge. I'll update my review later with my long-term thoughts.

The earbuds themselves are reasonably comfortable, and they stay in very snugly. They block out a lot of noise so you can't hear surrounding background noise, which is a plus.

I've used these earplug headphones for thousands of hours of manual labor.
I've yanked on the cord with tool handles, driveway gates
I've cut over 800 lineal feet of granite slab and polished over 70 square feet of granite (soaking wet activities, sometimes even done while it's raining outside)
Dug ditches

LOTS of manual labor.

The highs are fairly shrill at first, but as your ear wax coats the little fiber screens, they die down quite a lot. Eventually, the highs become lacking, and you have to take out the little screens and clean them. You can easily lose 6dB total sound output just because of earwax.
I really wish they either included extra screen things, or at least instructions as to what to make them out of. I suppose I do have some superfine stainless steel screen that I could use and soak in acetone whenever I need to clean them. I dare say I've got about 10 square meters of that stuff lying around.
Bass is satisfyingly boomy. Puts you in a rhythm. Great for EDM, which is what I listen to almost exclusively.
That microphone button doubles as a Pause button for my spare phone (music player). Priceless when you're wearing gloves, safety glasses, have your cord running through your shirt to your back pocket, and have your music player in a water-protective plastic bag.

Honestly, I do have some concerns about the build - the wires to the buds are pretty small, after all - But - that audio quality is really pretty nice for the relatively low price.

If you are tough on your headgear, I would probably say that these will sound great while they last - but not to expect them to last long.

BUT, If you tend to take good care of your gear, the sound quality easily makes these worth the low price.

Tried the other inserts and huge difference.  Counter-intuitively, thought the smaller inserts would allow the buds to go deeper into my ear canal and give me a better sound.  Wrong.  The larger 'block out' external noise and 'trap' for lack of a better term, the sound in your ear giving more mid/base.  These are not great but I don't hate them the way I did at first.

They simply do not last. I suppose if I simply sat still in a comfy chair, the wires would never sway, the connections would never be challenged, and the durability might be eternal. But the wires are a very thin gauge, the connections (especially to the angled jack) vulnerable, and even if you never catch a wire on a doorknob or counter corner - and I took special care not to - these earbuds will fail, apparently from the simple natural swaying motion of walking or jogging, within months. This my third failure, this last one having been comped to me by Panasonic after the failure of its predecessor, and three strikes you're out. Years ago I bought a straight-up no frills version of these Ergos - no mic, no pause - and today that's what I'm using, until I  decide on a replacement. Is the newer version made of cheaper materials, or with lousy quality control? Take your pick. The old ones are still functional. The new ones have all failed within 6 weeks.

I wish it were not so. Love the fit, can wear them to sleep, love a mic and a pause, and the price is brilliant. That's probably the issue. I'd happily pay double for a more durable product, but I generally buy less expensive buds because, well, they fail.

I'm actually shocked at the quality of the product for such a small price tag.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The buds are comfortable to place and don't make my ears hurt after extended wear (many products do).  I've had these for several months now, and with moderate use I've noticed no change in the quality or the performance.  I have an IPhone 5S, and even with a case they fit into the jack well.  My husband has a different case and they don't fit quite as snugly, but he's still able to use them.  In fact, my husband had a more expensive pair that he used daily.  They stopped working a few weeks ago so he asked to borrow mine.  After one use he noted that these are better than the more expensive ones he'd previously used.  He enjoyed them so much he asked me to order a pair for him.

I ordered the blue ones, and they're a beautiful electric blue.  The color is exactly as pictured.  The right and left are clearly labeled.  The cord is an appropriate length to use on phone, Ipad, etc.  The buds are clear and have stayed clean and maintained their shape throughout hours of use.

The only small draw back is the lack of microphone (unable to use these to make phone calls).  That's not really an issue for me, but it was the one thing my husband said he liked more about his other pair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Durability and Reliability test - Passed. (Four years of daily use and still functioning)

Been using this since 2012 during the day while I work to listen to music. These are the only earphones I use that do have not an in-line microphone because it is not needed for my office work. This gets rolled and tossed into my bag every weekday, yet.. no tears, no loose wires, earpads in tact. Fully functioning. Sound still crisp and clear. It can definitely stand the mild abuse.

Comfort test - Passed.

The fit is perfect for my ears - very ergonomic as the bud rests nicely in the concha (bowl-shaped cavity) of the ear, cradled by the intertragal notch - like a snug hug. The earpads insert easily into place for a gentle cushioned feel, loosely 'locking' into place very naturally. I've worn these for hours at a time without any aching of the ear or hint of tension so the comfort is definitely there. I have also used them while walking, running, cleaning, and they rarely fall out - thank goodness! It's so bloody annoying when earbuds slip out!

Sound test - Passed.

Let's be real. Don't expect Sennheiser quality audio on a earphone that costs less than popcorn at the movie theaters. But also don't brush it off either. The sound quality is rather good. To the average user, one most likely won't pick up the nuiances between amazing full bass, mid, or treble. These are definitely not bass-enhanced so don't expect these to pump out your favorite bass-powered beats to your liking, but they will do an acceptable job at nice highs and clear mids.

General notes:

Because of the fit of the earpad into the ear canal, it does block out some noise. Because I do use these for work, I normally just keep one of these earbuds in for the music while still being attentive within the environment. These earphones also do a decent job at keeping the audio 'localized', meaning if you are jamming music at full blast, the sound will leak from the earphones, but not too much. I can be listening to music at a somewhat loud scale and no one around me can hear it at all.

Comfort/fit comparison:

I am an android user and faithful Samsung Galaxy series smart phone user. I have the old Samsung Galaxy S2 earphones and the new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge earphones to compare comfort/ergo fit to. You'll see in my picture the stark difference in overall shape of the earbud from just three earphones. Yet despite my loyalty to Samsung Galaxy smartphones, the fit of their earphones are always terrible, even the latest S6 Edge earphone accessory. Here is why the fit and comfort of the humble Panasonic make my ears happier than most earpieces:

- See Samsung Galaxy S2 earphones. Nice soft silicone gel earpad but poor earbud shape that doesn't 'lock' into place with the natural shape of the outer ear. Thus, it frequently comes out like a loose, thick q-tip.
- See Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge earphones. Better quality silicone gel earpad that attempts to cushion the supposed natural shape of the ear canal entrance, but utterly fails for anyone with normal sized ears. Even with the smallest size gel earpads, the earphones frequently pop out and is very annoying. Not only that, the gel earpads frequently loosen from the buds itself and falls off. I got my S6 Edge summer of 2015 and I have already used all spare gel earpads + another set of replacement earpads (if you look closely at the photo, I had to resort to a Left earpad for my Right earbud because I had no more replacement earpads to use). I am now down to a single earpad and am giving up on these stupid earphones in general.

Verdict:
WORTH! Four years on a product that works on a daily and fits great for price of $6-$10? No brainer. Incredibly reliable and good quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Yeah. I totally underestimated the Panasonic RPHJE120V In-Ear Headphones. Holy s***. Let me tell you. For $7.49, you can have a wonderful in-ear headphone experience with these suckers. Although the violet didn't look like the picture, it's no reason to take a star away from these cute earphones. With every in-ear headphone, IT IS CRUCIAL TO FIND WHICH SET OF EARBUDS PROPERLY FIT YOUR EAR. These earphones came with three different sizes, similar to some other earphones that I have. These specific earphones have a circular structure, but  an oval-like design. Thus, they are supposed to fit snuggly into your ear and they are supposed to literally fully plug your ears to reach their maximum potentially. Please keep that in mind when you are trying to by in-ear headphones. I learned after buying, returning, and losing a few earbuds, as I never had a chance (or gave them a chance) to test the earbuds out out of my laziness.

These earphones are comfortable, have a very impressive sound, and music can be clearly heard. I listened to a few intense piano pieces to quiet ones, and also listened to Wu-Tang and then some Frank Sinatra after. Lol. I'm not disappointed by these and I don't think I ever will. I consider this a dark horse because Panasonic may not be Bose, Sennheiser, Audio Technica, or any other high quality brand, but these will sweep you away if you just let them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are the things that keep me up at night. So I listen to podcasts. Soothing, calm, Australian podcasts with the most lovely voices that I get so lost in I can't focus on the words ... which puts me to sleep. Sweet, blissful, sleep. Except Snorey McSnorepants can't sleep if I play my podcasts in the room at large, and I can't sleep with snoring. These headphones have a low enough profile that I can sleep on my side without hurting my absurdly sensitive ears, AND they manage to block enough sound that on a good night, I don't need earplugs, just headphones. On a bad night, I put one earplug in the ear facing up and one headphone in the ear on the pillow and I sleep beautifully.

You will not confuse them with a more expensive pair; however, they are reliable workhorses when you do not want to risk ruining or losing your $100+ buds. The fit is excellent, and these come with multiple latex/silicone ear pieces, so you can find the style that works best for you and your wearing routine.  These also are relatively effective at external noise reduction, and I can wear them easily and comfortably for  much of the day, many hours at a crack, when flying, etc. Used previous pair for over a year before they got caught on a drawer knob and suffered wire fatigue which resulted in a crackly hearing experience and thus the replacement.

The experience for music is fine and above average for the price. When it 'counts' I wear a higher quality set, but wear these the bulk of the time out of the home. No one is going to mug you for these, and you are not going to cry if they get broken or are lost, and that is precisely why I bought them.

Very satisfied, and will likely order yet another pair to have on hand to mitigate potential lack of availability later when I need them. Cord is longish, so I use a cord keeper with these, though your habits might not require one.

I buy lots of pairs because I use them for everything! I have some in my shop (instead of ear plugs, when working with noisy tools), some at work, some for next to the bed, some for travel. Plus, I lose them once-in-a-while, but for $8/pair, I'm not worried.

I use them while working, reading, mowing the lawn, shoveling the driveway, riding in a car, flying on a plane, etc etc etc. I have tried various wireless earbuds (Bestfy QY7 Bluetooth 4.1 Wireless Sports Headphones Noise Cancelling Sweatproof In-ear Stereo Earbuds Earphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad iPod and Android Devices (Green)), over-the-ear headphones (Sony MDRV6 Studio Monitor Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil) and others.

Suddenly the right headphone stopped working. Wanted to get another Shure but i will not pay more than $50 for a headphones again. Another problem with the Shure are the cables they broke down in the same place always. Saw this for $7 and the reviews, well brought them. They are nice, sound good, the sound quaility is worse than the Shure, this are 10x cheaper than the sure. The sound is what 20% worse? Is not noticeable, the bass is stronger than the Sures. That is something i did not like about the SE215 was the bass. So the sure cost $100 plus $60 in cables. Get this and forget about Shure. How much will this headphone last? Who knows but they are $7, cost less than the OEM Sure cables or replacement cables.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These earphone sound very very good, far better than $8 should sound. And they are FAR better than the similar looking/priced Philips SHE 359OBL/10s. The Panasonics have real sound and, no, not saying they sound as good as $100 earphones but if you're looking for an inexpensive set of earphones that you're not going to treat harshly then you will enjoy your music just fine with these. The Philips sound better than the very cheapest 'phones but the Panasonics are FAR better. Now, realize you're not getting the most sturdily built 'phones ever. Abuse them a bit and I'm sure they'll break. But if you're looking for very good sound for $8 these are what you want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Lipsitz","Sound quality not what I expect from this brand","November 26, 2019","Sound quality is about average, low base and high treble, maybe appropriate for phone calls but not to great with music, which sounds like an old AM transistor radio I built as a child once.  Noise cancellation is poor, but then this style rarely does the job adequately (over-the-ear headphones are much better at noise cancellation).  As moisture wicking is not a function of this style headphone, that was scored as a 1 and not considered in overall score.

In short, it is functional for calls, the main reason I have it, but beyond that I could not recommend this to others.  Panasonic had once been a great brand, but if they can't get this right, I don't think I should consider much more costly and complex items from them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I take good care of the big headphones at home, but when I'm on the go I tend to destroy them in no time. So, thanks to the rate at which I destroy the things, I decided to stop buying nice earbuds and get ones that won't matter if I destroy them in a month or two.

They probably won't last long. The cords are really thin and plasticky rather than the thick braided cable that come with the better units I've still managed to break. Of course I can just grab another pair of these when they break and not be sad that I just destroyed an expensive pair of Sennheiser earbuds again.

The worst thing about these are the really poor earpiece selection. None of them properly fit my ears leaving me with a high tinny sound and almost zero bass unless I'm wearing a hat that can press the buds into my ears. I've read in reviews here that this is due to poor fit, but when none of the ear pieces actually fit me I can't test that out for myself.

It's okay, and for the price it's not bad at all, I just need to set the EQ on my player to be very bass heavy and turn the volume up higher than I normally would have it.

I'll keep my quality at home where I have nice cans that are safe from being destroyed and take these with me so I can still listen to my music but not worry about taking care of my headphones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

There are NO earbuds under $100 that will sound next level.  None.

What you want in the under $100 level is a clear mic and clear sound that's lively.

All mics at under $100 sound muffled/muddy.  But these Pannys are a smidge/notch better/intelligible than the others.  Only the proprietary digital plug iphone earbuds trounce the Panny and all others for that matter.

As for sound.  Good bass and clear.  Nothing offensive.  Good enough to please.  The ""next level"" will be above $100.  Don't kid yourself thinking you'll get some awesome sounds for anything less.  Trust me.  I've tried multititudes of earbuds that have been raved at several price points.

So with that said. $10 Pannys give you what you want.  If they get lost or crushed.  No biggie.  You're out $10.  And the mic/sound is more than good enough to do the job.  Want something markedly ""next level"" better?  Then be prepared that you'll have to crack open the wallet big time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/product-reviews/B003EM8008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
