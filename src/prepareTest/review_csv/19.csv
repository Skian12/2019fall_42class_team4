The headphone came with a nice package. The experience is pretty great with my smartphone and MacBook. Right now, perhaps the wire has some connection issues because my puppy chewed it, and sometimes it triggered my MacBook's Itunes accidentally. Thus, I purchase another Panasonic ErgoFit Earbud Headphone to avoid the situation. I feel the Betron's one has a stronger Bass effect and Panasonic's one has a cleaner voice.  One bonus point from Betron's one is it won't get tangled easily.

Unfortunately they appear to have added a microphone/remote to all of the models, taking a good product and making it way below average.  In just 2 days I’ve had to deal with bizarre static every time I try to use the microphone and, if you wear them while moving around, the remote constantly and randomly changes the volume any time it brushes against your clothing (forget about using them on the treadmill, the volume changes constantly).

They used to make a great set of basic headphones with no remote or microphone - I hope they bring those back because the microphone/remote model is nowhere near as good.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Folks, I've bought & tried several types of phones/buds the last few years.  These are undoubtably the best I have ever used.  Because I am deaf in one ear, I am unfortunately unable to hear stereo but the music to the one ear is crisp and clear!  There is no missing parts of any song that I can hear!  It nearly cancels out any outside noise like my wife watching TV.  I'll read and listen to my music.  You know the saying, ""Happy wife, happy life!"" The ear buds are so comfortable I have fallen asleep and never noticed the ear buds stillî in my ears!!  I can't speak to durability yet nor can I comment on phone compatibility because i doubt they will ever be used in such capacity.

The other ear buds sizes feel weird n doesn't stick in your ears for too long when workout out or moving upper body section too much.

My headphones broke recently for the second time n it was over the same reason. It got tugged a few times as in grabbing it from my bag n pocket, however that was too much pressure for it.

They look and feel sturdy, and have a very sleek design. The sound quality is also really nice, especially the sound quality of the bass. The buttons also feel fairly sturdy and secure, so they don't fall off like other brands' buttons.

My problem with these is that they just don't last! I've bought two pairs and both times, they deteriorated after like two months. Both times, the microphone and controls started going haywire really soon after I bought them. They either stop working altogether, or start making my phone do weird things like randomly turning on Google assistant or constantly pausing or skipping music. In the most recent pair, they've been emitting a lot of static for the past week or so.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They are definitely more concerned with style than comfort in the way that they are made and the last thing they are concerned with it fitting in one's ear properly.

They always fall out because of their poor design and weight.  I have tried to shove the back part of the bud into my ear to squeeze the headphones in and keep them in my ear.  Not only is this painful, but it also does not work.

Oh my word yes.","December 22, 2018","Ok, here's the thing. For the price, the sound is excellent, the very good bass was unexpected. I messed around with the equaliser and my mind was blown. The metallic material feels surprisingly good coming from my wooden Symphonized NRG 3.0's.

HOWEVER! The surprising thing is that NONE and I mean NONE of the earbud rubbers fit my ears, not even the ones that came on the earphones. For me, the medium size works and it's been that way for my Sony extra bass, Skull Candy's, JBl's T110's, Anker sound buds slim and Panasonic headsets, medium works perfectly. None worked for the Bertrons. That was disappointing. Especially considering that I had to resort to my old buds from previous earphones (luckily I kept them all). Almost gave a three but the sound quality compensates if you have other extra buds.

I have to say, no regrets. Admittedly the gold color feels a little blingy, but the sound quality is better, the cables are more sturdy, and (while I recognize this may not be useful for everyone) the color makes them easier to find amidst the crowds of cables that live at home and at work for me.

Hoping to use this brand for another 10 years for sure!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

1. Sound is decent for the price
2. Remote works well
3. Nice packaging

Now here are the problems that ruin it for me:

1. The earbuds sizes are all too big. Even the smallest size offered is not that different from the medium and large sizes. As a result they keep falling off my ears and never stay in place. That is also the case for the ""memory foam"" pair of earbuds. They are too big to begin with and after trying them out for 2 weeks, thinking they would shape nicely and become a snug fit, nothing. This rules out doing anything involving movement, even a light activity such as walking becomes problematic. Since I listen to music a lot going to the gym or walking in general, it quickly becomes annoying.

2. I sometimes experience a disconnection while plugged in my smartphone. This never happened to me with any other brand before. What I mean is that the earphones are plugged in, and all of a sudden the sound will stop coming from them, but from the phone's speaker, until I unplug/plug back in. I checked several times if it came from the phone or the connector, but I tried friends' ear/headphones, and didn't have any problem.","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

But be sure you experiment with the different silicon nibs. Sizing those right is the #1 reason your earbuds will sound too bassy, too distant or not full enough.

The build of the earbuds is very good. The sound initially was harsh and rough.  But after several days of burn-in, the sound quality improved significantly. The pair of earbuds I have has a quite nice mid-range, and the high-range is pretty clear and clean, while bass is fine.  Overall the sound quality is very good, in some case, is actually better than that of those cost me more than $60.

If you're only concerned about bass, these are well worth the money. I bought them for gaming, thinking the reviews expressed a general quality of sound. And sure, they sound good, but they are way too heavy on the bass for gaming.

Voice comms get distorted and even low music volumes disrupt the sound of ambient sounds.

My first impressions were that it looks mediocre at best with it's golden finish and not exactly an ear friendly design. Owned a Skullcandy Method before them and those were SURELY more bass heavy, but again, it's a decent compromise for the price. So if you prefer something understated and sleek, looks elsewhere please
Regardless, I would say no headphone is worth even a dollar if they don't last longer than a house mouse. The right ear has gone out, the mic seems to not function at all. Maybe it's me, maybe I rough housed it a bit by throwing them in my jeans back pocket and THAT'S where the difference lies- just buy a more expensive model so that you have to take care of it. These aren't cheap but rugged, just cheap.

They would be great for a steampunk Halloween costume.","October 3, 2019","I had good expectations. The packaging was nice. The overall look quite retro/steampunk. Fit in ears wasn't great, although they get one extra star for including pretty high quality foam earbud pieces. You'd expect for the ear bud bits to be multiple sizes, but they look to be all one size. (And no, they don't stay in.)

These bud cans are quite heavy. Edges are sharp, and I wouldn't want to fall asleep with them. They are legit sharp enough to slash paper.

Now the sound; the only thing I cared about. Garbage.  My reference standard is a set of MDR-ZX110. A $20 set of headphones. This pair of Sony's is a ~ 3.5/5. My $200 pair of Bose earbuds from 8 years ago are a 4.5/5. A pair of RHA-150's from 6 years ago which has been in the washing machine and on a few hundred runs with me are a 4.0. And lastly, stock apple ear buds are a solid 3. These are a 1/5.

Sound is empty, full of extra tin, completely uncomfortable and no bass to speak of.

There are time when spending top dollar doesn’t always lead to top quality either. With that said these earbuds offer a decent quality sound for a decent price. Also love how it functions with my iPhone. There are others out there who claim they’ll work with iOS but don’t.

Only flaw I see in these earbuds is some more options for the earpieces like the cone shaped ones maybe. Apart from that they are great. Although the memory foam tips are more comfortable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The sound definitely has a v shaped sound profile. The lows can be overpowering and make the mix muddy. Even with songs that you want bumpin can sound like you are just listening to a kick drum. But with a little EQ fu they sound pretty clear. The drivers are definitely capable.

I would say this product was a teeny bit disappointing. I was expecting a much clearer listening experience with some strong bass. But it was just all lows and bass. I'd say check them out if you love that big bass. Compared to beats I can say they are much stronger.. so I guess they've got that going for them?

However, I have had several issues with these earbuds. None of the earbuds provided are actually small enough to fit very comfortably. There is also so heft to these compared to other ear buds I’ve used. The tight fit of even the smallest pair creates a feeling of my ears needing to pop. If I am still I can rest them in my ear without the tight fit. If I need to stand, walk, or move they constantly fall out of my ears.

I am very pleased with the durability and reliability of these earbuds/headphones. As far as sound quality over a wide range, I DO NOT have  a BOSE or similar pair of headphones to compare, but I feel that I lose nothing in terms of sound quality over a wide range of genres. The only negative that I can think of is that the wires sometimes become unwieldy, but I am not sure if there is a solution to that, as this problem occurs with all similarly wired earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Fact is, I really do not want to jeopardize material and sound quality despite having because cheap on my investment in headphones. Here, I have the perfect product for me. I simply cannot believe this kind of quality is possible for a product at this price point. I feel like I won the lottery on this one. It is also good looking and I don't feel embarrassed using it. The product feels like it has been made with care and love and allows people on budget to really enjoy some good sound quality. The only issue, which probably is not much of an issue at all, is that the metal part touches my skin on my ear. When I first put it on, its suuuper cold.

Solid build quality,nothing is flimsy and it has some heft to it. Im no runner,but that may be an issue.
Not as tangle free as flat wired headphones,but ive had no real tangles either. This model works with IOS button wise.
No complaints on the other end of phone calls from the mic. They do tend to extend into the ear well and not stick out far.
Bass is clear and tight but will boom when you want it,mids and highs dont seem affected by the bass waves either and drown them out.

The bass is good and the overall sound quality is also not bad. I've owned more expensive headphones that had better overall sound quality, but these are pretty great for the price point. The mesh-looking material on the back of one of the earbuds came off after only a couple of months of use, but I'm not particularly careful with these. One earbud has even taken a swim in my coffee mug and lived to see another day. If you're looking for something super durable this might not be the right item for you. Overall think this is a great pair of earbuds for the price range.

I've had these headphones for almost a year and the experience has had its ups and downs.

At first, I was very happy with these headphones. The build quality was good and the sound was very good for the price range.

Eventually, some flaws in the design made me less happy. I do want to note that I use these headphones on a semi-daily basis and they still work great. I've had no issues with build or sound quality. But, if you walk a lot or exercise, these are not the headphones for you. They tend to fall out of my ear when moving around even when I tried the other ear sizes. I've had some issues with that in the past with other headphones but never as bad as this.

But the biggest issue is that the metal construction and the cylindrical design with sharp edges actually dig into my ear. I can position it so that it won't hurt me but that position also makes it more likely that they'll pop out. I can't wear these for any length of time unless I know I'm going to be motionless for the majority of the time. This is probably dependent on your ear shape but for me, these were NOT comfortable headphones.

Otherwise, the build and sound quality were admirable for the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Only thing better are my Bose and Sony noise canceling  headphones at $350.00.

- they look amazing
- very well packaged
- sound range is loud
- bass is very prominent (didn’t change any equalizer settings on my devices, just the basics)
- the microphone works

- First CON with these: the buds are on the heavy side and seem to FALL out with the slightest movements. I’ve tried (over and over again) to really bury them into my ears, along with trying the included different sized silicone bits. They still end up falling out.
- Second CON: the earbuds tend to get WARM after about 15 minutes of use and that’s without the volume being turned way up. (About 3 ticks on an iPhone)
- CON #3: you can hear when the wires of these are tapped or touch anything solid

Pros:

High Quality
Affordable
Great design
Has Mic

Cons:

Not good for working out at a gym. Constantly falls out of ear at Gym.

Note: This only pertains to the Gym, these have no issues with falling out of your ears while doing non-vigorous activities such as riding in a car, at school, walking, biking, etc.

I would 100% recommend these to anyone who appreciates high quality music, good bass, ability to make calls with the headphones microphone, smooth-fit design.

I consider these to be equivalent to those $150 Dr. Dre beats headphones. I've had both these and Dr Dre and these are identical in quality and only a fraction of the price.

I received these headphones today.  They came in a nice package which included the extra rubber tips, as well as a pair of foam ones.  I think the tips tend to run larger than normal (I have used the medium sized tips that have come with headphones I have previously bought, but needed the small ones that came with these headphones).  The tips still don't feel like they fit quite right, but that could be because the headphones stick out of the ear quite a bit.  They do not seem to fall out, regardless.

The sound quality is actually pretty good, though I am no expert.  I can clearly hear a wide range (I played a diversity of songs and compared the sound with some Sennheiser HD 598 Cs close-backed headphones), with decent balance throughout the range that I can tell.  The sound obviously is not as nice as with the Sennheiser, as these headphones are not as noise-isolating, but I would say they are really good for being so cheap.

In terms of build quality, these are made of cheap construction.  That should be expected with such cheap headphones.  The plastic components (all the gold looking parts that are not the actual metal jack are made of some cheap plastic.  The speaker casings are also made of cheap-feeling plastic.  The cord seems to be decent, however, it is lacking much bend protection at the joints.  The plastic piece that slides up and down the cords that go to the individual speakers seems pretty loose, but appears to do an adequate job.

The microphone seems to work fine, and the controls are adequate for a Samsung Galaxy S8 (No fast-forward or rewind, but it still has volume, play/pause, call control, play next track, and play previous track).

I hope this helps.  Will update on durability if parts begin to fail.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

And pay close attention to the ad; This seller is a Chinese shop posing as the real Betron dealer!! I should have read the description carefully, then I would have seen the 'Chinglish' grammatical errors. Don't buy these from this particular guy, it's not Betron. These are a very very clever knockoff, but not quite good enough.

These earbuds are nothing more than $3 drivers crammed into a cheesy gold plated case that feels like low-grade cast tin with a lousy ugly gold coating that immediately rubs away. The build quality is utter garbage. The bass is OKish. Mids and highs sound like wank through a tin can, just plain unacceptable. I have a set that came with my Roku that blows these away.

Cheesy Chinese bling.. don't waste your time or money. They're about on par with $8 gas station earbuds.

Maybe I have a really clever knockoff. But after seeing the design in person, I don't want the real thing either. What a huge letdown this was.

Now that I think about it, these definitely have to be counterfeit. All the logos are correct, but this box looks nothing like the box genuine UK Betron YSM1000's come in. And only 3 sets of mediocre ear pieces. Wich the the REAL Betron website shows is completely different to what's being sold here in the US under this Chinese rat shack Amazon shop.

The portion that is sticking out is longer than the portion inside your ear, so they are off-balance and can tip out of your ear.  So they are only good if you are sitting still in a quiet place.  If you are moving around, they will fall out.  Also, they do not stay in well in general, so they are not noise cancelling on a plane, which is the main time I use them.

Bass is really good. About 20% louder than some cheaper earbuds I just bought to replace my old ones.
The GOOD:
+ Sound is really good. Good Bass and loud.
+ Foam earpads are a plug
+ Tangle free wires? Yup...my first pair of tangle free wires and they actually don't get tangled. Imagine that.
+ Comes with a nice carrying case, very slim. I actually use this one.
+ Mic and controls work great.
+ Construction definitely better than any cheapy earbuds. The wires are a bit thicker in clear housing.
+ And did I mention....they sound really great.

The Bad:
- Took me a couple days to figure out which one was Left and Right. On their website, they show a picture of a pair with Gold colored bases on the wiring marked L and R. That's where this one is, but the base is black color, so missed it the first couple of days. No biggie, just a bit strange to mark anything in black plastic.
- Kinda ""blingy"" with gold, silver and shiny cords. Probably really nice if you like that, and any other options may drive cost up, but something to note if you are not into ""blingy"" stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They work perfectly. You can see in the picture he rolled up the left earbud and just twist-tied it so it's not dangling while we use just one side. The mic is on the right earbud line, but they're bullet shaped so you could pop it in your other ear if you prefer. The cable is covered in a very soft, flexible silicone-feeling insulation. It's got a little weight to it so it hangs nicely but doesn't tangle easily. It also comes with a little plastic clip you could hook to your shirt, four sizes of silicone earbud cushions, and a nice carry pouch with a pinch-open top. I have very small ears and don't usually like this style of earbud, but the smallest cushion size (while a little tough to get on the earbud itself) fits my ears comfortably enough. I haven't worn them long enough to tell whether I'll be comfortable wearing them for an hour+ of gaming. My husband can wear most any style of earbuds and says these have been comfortable for him for hours of gaming wear. We're both very happy to have found such durable, nice looking earbuds that work for the PS4 without shelling out a lot of money or settling for annoying, sweaty, over-the-ear gaming headsets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Comfortable and good sound quality.","January 2, 2019","I bought these to replace an aging pair of JVC “marshmallow-type” in-ear earphones. The standard ear buds that came with my iPhone are okay - nothing spectacular - but not very comfortable and don’t stay in my ears very well. My old JVCs were good for filtering out the outside world, but the ear cushions eventually get hard and I wanted something with better quality. These Betron YSM 1000 earbuds are awesome! Very comfortable and sound quality is very good for small, in-ear buds. Not exactly studio monitors, but for inexpensive, compact phones they are excellent. Base response is surprisingly good, and they stay in my ears without falling out. For the money these are an excellent buy! Highly recommended. Serious audiophiles will need to shell out a lot more money as these aren’t going to satisfy true hifi enthusiasts, but then again they probably aren’t shopping for in-ear phones anyway. For the average consumer who wants to make phone calls and listen to streaming music on their phone or iPod or watch streaming video, these are an excellent choice. They work great with my iPhone and iPad. The remote works as expected to answer calls, adjust volume, and pause videoI don’t think I could find anything better in this price range, or even at twice the price. I’m very happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I tend to be very gentle and careful with headphones especially after my last pair broke, but somehow while I was sitting down listening to music, the earphone for left ear stopped working. The sound just stopped out of nowhere and won't come back. Also the piece that connects the actual earbud to the cord keeps slipping off of the right earphone. Other than poor durability, these earphones don't offer the best sound. I like earphones with crisp and clear sound and a deep bass. The bass is great but in my opinion, the sound is somewhat muffled and drowned out. However they do get really loud. The sound quality isn't really an issue when u switch out the standard earbuds covers for the foam noise isolating ones. But they break very easily, are impossible to clean, and don't stay in your ear. These earphones are also quite bulky.

Of course the material and durability quality is just a tad bit lower (the transparent wiring is not of the highest quality, there are some hard plastic coverings on certain areas, and to my disappointment the earbuds are low quality which detracts from the overall above average quality ) than those crazy expensive earphones but it will last you for enough time. If you are a professional musician you will definitely notice that the bass tries to drown out some lack of crisp music clarity and that the sound quality is a bit on the non clear side. But to an average person wearing earphones these will sound just like beats and any other top notch brands. I have seen a few people comment about using these to workout, I have used these to go running for 3+ miles on treadmill and outside and they are just like my apple earphones. They will occasionally slip out and you have to push them back in but they work fine for me during running.

its also important to note that if you watch youtube reviews of these earphones the box and stuff is not the same as what is offered here on amazon.

edit bumping from 1 star to 2. Getting the right fit and reshuffling all of your audio output helps a tiny bit. But the quality is still wildly inconsistent in left ear due to possibly fit? Got to move my jaw and tilt my head a certain way to hear more than treble out of it.

Betron is a fantastic company and I highly recommend their earbuds. First off, I've never tried out $50+ earbuds and don't know if they'd last any longer than a cheap pair. But I stick to $8-25 earbuds because every time, in a year and a half or less, is when earbuds start dying on me. More often than not the sound starts going out of one ear far sooner than a year even. Plus, most earbuds for that price range don't have the high quality sound that this pair from Betron does.

Not only that, but 8.5 months after I bought my first pair, when the sound finally started shorting out in one ear, I contacted Betron and politely told them about my issue. They no questions asked, an hour or so later responded apologizing for the earbuds not meeting their usual high standards and sent me a replacement pair for absolutely free. My new pair just showed up today about a week or so later.

Oh and one more thing, it looks like Betron is working on improving the earbuds. The button switch design is different on my replacement pair but they have the same model number. I highly recommend Betron's earbuds. They don't have the subpar sound quality of other $20 or less earbuds and the company is very nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

On top of that, the microphone seems slightly better than the phone's build-in microphone, according to people I call often. The sound is quite crisp, compared to the many other inexpensive headsets I've worn out.  More informed reviewers than me state it has ""great bass response"", I think that is correct.

It has a number of music-player functions that vary from obvious (volume, next track, pause, etc) to Morse-code (""Press the center button three times quickly and hold"" to rewind current tune). I imagine if you need that don't-touch-the-phone functionality, well, there it is.

I usually don't mention packaging as it is not relevant to performance, but they do toss in extra pairs of ear-canal-bud-adapter thingies and an unusual pouch to store the headset in.  The foam-lined magnet-latched box is grade-A, don't see how that helps to sell online.

I do have two nits to pick with these headphones, but these are sort of begrudging compliments:  (1) The ear-buds are unusually heavy, so you might have to swap the ear-canal-thingies and/or not do aerobics or kick-boxing with these. Jogging or treadmill might be a real problem.  (2) Your mileage might vary, but my wife liked the sound/microphone so much that, uh, I needed to buy a second set.  Which I did and it performs as good as the first sample :^D","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Excellent sound quality. Clear highs, nice mids, bass is surprisingly good as well. Music sounds excellent as does spoken work like audio books, etc. All three ranges are equally distributed. I wouldn't add or subtract from any of the three. They feel solidly build and the chord looks like it will not tangle easily. The gold colored volume control/mic piece is place on the left side which makes reaching for it feel natural with my right hand. Most earbuds have the controller on right side and that makes for awkward reaching. They fit very nicely in the ears and are very comfortable. I think they will be good for work even for wearing them all day without discomfort. They look cool too. I really like the fact that the red ear bud has a red ring around it and the left has a black ring. This will make it easy to know which is left/right. They also have L and R on the earbuds. Overall a great buy. I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

They have an amazing depth of sound and cancel outside noises relatively well. The microphone is also pretty sensitive. The only complaint that I have is the weight of the earbuds. They are a lot heavier than average earbuds since they are made out of metal, which makes it easier for them to fall out of your ear.

My source music is often from analog tape to CD (AAD format) so the quality and sound will be much different than more modern music from recent years. So having said that, I believe the bass is much more Dynamic and clear than similar priced headphones. Highs and mid-range sound good too even though the style of music I listen to can often reveal the tape Source sound. These headphones do not reveal as much of the tape source as others. Comes with the standard interchangeable earbuds for different size ears and a small carrying pouch. Standard  volume buttons, track selection, pause, mute, microphone so no new innovations or surprises. So overall I'm very satisfied with these headphones. The cons are the wire seems rather flimsy and delicate and I can only imagine that they are going to pull out of the plug in the headphone piece itself. This hasn't happened yet it just seems flimsier than other headphones. I'm a bit hard on headphones and the wire usually breaks for me around the 3.5 mm Jack and I have a hard time getting headphones to last for a month to a year. Wireless, which these are not, break on me even faster so I don't wish to invest a lot of money in headphones. These headphones seem a good value for the money I just hope I can make them last a little longer than normal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Not so great for everything else.","July 30, 2019","I've spent an entire day with these so I'll give a review.

I'm really conflicted here. On one hand, the bass sounds really good, like high-quality expensive good. But when it comes to actual vocals and certain instruments, the quality weakens. Vocals sound muffled, distant and cheap. Instruments like the piano sound painful. It sounds like a cheap pair of earbuds with top quality bass - which feels weird because some songs will sound amazing and some will sound pretty bad. The bass also really feels like it overpowers the vocals. You'll find yourself wanting to louder the volume in more lyrical based songs, but that also loaders the bass - so it really conflicts with each-other.

Aesthetically the earbuds are really nice. They look and feel really expensive. But for some reason, they hurt my ears after a while. I've never had this problem before with any other pair of earphones. They're actually pretty heavy earbuds - so maybe it's that, or maybe the strong bass just gets to my ears after an hour or so.

I used to have a $5 pair of earbuds that I loved. I purchased them for years, and the company that made them went out of business. I decided to try these, based on the reviews - but they don't live up to the hype. I see some of the top comments saying ""as good as Beats!"" and stuff, but there's just no way.

I wouldn't say they're horrible, but they're just not for me. I'm probably going to return them and look for something else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Idk)
I need noise blocking earbuds because i listen to white noise at night to block out my noisy neighbors, seeing as I live in a college dorm and college kids are always loud. Turns out that these buds sometimes randomly SHOCK my ear and jolt me awake. The sound pops as well. There are times when the fear of being electrocuted kept me up and even, ironically, prevented me from sleeping.

So I went onto Amazon right now and looked at all the 1 star reviews, and a substantial number of them included how the earbuds do, in fact, electro shock you, which confirmed that this isnt something that happened because of mistreatment to the earbuds, and that this is a manufactering problem for the product period.

I'm not sure if these shocks are dangerous, but i just ordered another pair of earbuds because although these ones are in relatively ok condition, I can't risk inflicting lasting damage on my ear.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I sent and email to Betron about my problem. Within a week a new pair was sent to me for free. I was astonished at the customer service. Here is my updated review.

These earbuds are an excellent choice at their price point. For $20 or Under these headphones have a lot of pros and very minor problems which is stated below.
First, the contents of the box. The box Includes 4 pairs of ear tips. Large, Medium, Small, and Memory Foam Type. The selection of ear tips included makes sure that no ear size is left behind. I favored the foam tips because they provided great sound isolation, snug fit, and overall great sound. The box also includes a carrying pouch and a wire clip. For just under $20 these earbuds come with a lot of different options for the user. Now, let's get into the pro's and the con's.

The Pro's:
Great Sound Isolation
Great Ear tip Selection
Deep and Powerful Bass
Handy Carrying Case
Stylish Look
Snug Fit and Comfortable

The Con's:
When Listening Too Classical Music, the Lows Can Slightly Overpower The Mids And Highs, But This Is Almost Not Noticeable.
The Memory Foam Ear tips Can Tear, So Be Gentle With Them.

In Conclusion, if you are looking for an affordable, great sounding, and comfortable pair of earbuds, I would totally recommend these. The Sound, Comfort, And Style make the Betron YSM1000s a great choice for just under $20.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Nelson","BEWARE - painful to wear, failing within less than a day of use.","March 7, 2019","These earbuds look sleek and stylish but are not practical. Since these are earbuds, they are meant to sit comfortably in the ear for an extended amount of time.  This is not the case, they did not sit in the ear well and I really had to jam them in to keep them from falling out. Additionally, there is a sharp metal edge that bites into the antitragus area of your ear after a short time. Within two hours of wearing I had noticeable irritation and swelling from the friction/bite of the earbuds. Seems like a bad design for something that is meant to fit in the ear. As far as I know I have a normal outer ear, never had any problem with ear buds before.

I was planning to sand down the sharp edges and work with getting a better fit to my ear - however within 3 hours of use the left speaker started to crackle and hiss at a high decibel in my ear. I plugged them into a variety of sources and all the same.

Bottom line, these are poor quality, painful ear buds that I regret buying.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They seemed to be high quality, the sound was great for the price, and they were comfortable enough. But there is a big problem which is not excusable and made me give these phones 2 stars.

Whenever my phone shifts in my pocket and the headphones are plugged in, it makes a static like popping sound right in my ear, and the volume changes on its own. Usually the volume goes down, which is better than up since that could damage my hearing, but it is still extremely annoying and not worth it.

I should note that this is not just a problem with my specific pair. After discovering this problem, I returned the headphones and they sent me another pair. These ones had the same problem.

Out of the box they sounds GREAT with IOS and for earbuds the bass sounds amazing. The button on neck are easy to push small and the casing around them is tough so they will likely never get damaged.

The only thing I wanted to note for potential buyers is that the cable is thin and lightweight which I really like you can barely even tell you're wearing earbuds. The only thing is they seem like they could be damaged easily so these are not for heavy working conditions or accident prone people unless you don't mind risking it.

That aside, product has to be given five stars because of the price. My only minor quibbles are that although the picture clearly shows the 3.5mm plug, the description says for iPhone; and it really isn’t for most iPhones. Secondarily, the wires are just the slightest bit thin, but they’re made from what appears to be a tangle-resistant material.

The sound is equivalent to the $100+ bracket. I’m extremely picky and occasionally an amateur audiophile. I do have a set beats pro (with a desktop amp they put 650’s to shame and I prefer the sound over qc35). Anyway, I have traditionally always purchased the $20 Skullcandy headphones with the mic. They have a much wider range and better clarity than other similarly-priced earbuds. That has changed.

These Betron YSM1000’s are simply better. They’re the best budget earbuds I’ve ever heard. While the SC earbuds might be equal for most mids, there is no comparison in depth or range. The YSM1000’s have a clear edge in lows, and an even clearer advantage in highs. Based on craftsmanship, I expect these to equal or outlast the SC’s. I have used the mic 3-4 times and have had no complaints. These are not $10 or $15 earbuds, I guarantee you that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They're heavy and want to fall out of your ear from the weight.  Biggest issue? They didn't last!  I take very good care of my earbuds.  I once had a set of Sennheisers last 9 years.

What you get for the price (as you can read from the other reviews) is really high value.  Fair base, mids are best, and highs are decent.  One of the ear buds went out after a few months so I contacted customer service, saying how much i love the pair with the small exception of a broken bud and they sent out a new set.  No questions asked.
I would've rated these headphones 5 stars before, but with my experience and ease of replacement - it'd be nice if i could rate it higher.

I needed a cheap set of earbuds to use when it really didn't matter if they were lost or damaged. These really sound good. I've been a Sennheiser guy for quite a while, their sound fits me. Sound, like beauty, is relative. People like what they like. I wasn't expecting these to sound anywhere near the way they do. I'm not saying they sound as good as my Sennheisers, but they outperformed a lot of brands costing many time over what these do. The Midrange was clean and really surprising, they actually have good Bass. The thing that shocked me the most was how loud they play. Almost every brand of earbuds recommends an amplifier, which can cost thousands of dollars. I plugged these in and actually had to turn the volume down. That really got my attention. In fact, I've even found myself reaching for these when my others were closer at hand.

I think these are the best $13 headphones I’ve ever bought.  I don’t care if they last 6 months, still cheaper than buying a better pair with similar sound quality.

Not at all tinny like you would expect from cheap headphones, full range of bass and treble, like you would expect with headphones these days, you need to be sure to adjust the fit with the provided rubber ear adaptors to get the best sound.

Far better than skullcandy in same price ranges 16+.

My favorite brands in the past have been skull candy and bose. I feel the overall balance is very nice, the bass is there but you can still appreciate every other piece of the music as well which is nice.

I do happen to have smaller ears and wish that the small size marshmallows were just a tiny bit smaller but this is a common thing I run into anyway.

I’ve owned these for a few weeks now and have noticed no deterioration in music quality or on the outer materials.

They also include a mic so you can take calls or use them as a headset to play games with friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

First, they came prime fast, no problems. In the time before Christmas came, I received TWO emails from them asking how I liked them. Pretty impressive. Material quality: when she opened them, she didn't want to touch them, they looked ""too fancy"". Sound quality: She plugged them into her phone, and her eyes lit up. I haven't been able to listen to them myself, but by her reaction they must sound mighty fine. I had been buying her some Panasonic earphones, which don't sound bad for the price, BUT, these are about the same price. They LOOK tons better, and (apparently) sound better.

The wire is generally very resistant to tangling and the metal 3.5 mm jack seems very sturdy. The sound is balanced aside from the accentuated bass.

Design and feel of the headphones were great out of the box. Amazing look and construction.

The sound however... it sounded almost like you were listening to a speaker on the other side of the room. The lows were audible but the highs were very flat. The overall sound was not good for human voice. Which means video/podcasts were no good.

Don’t get me wrong. The ear buds sounded very decent, especially when I was comparing them directly to the cheap Sony $9 earbuds. You might not even notice the “distant” sound when listening to a lot of songs. But if you want to use this for more than that — it’s going to sound off.

Not a good shock...","January 3, 2019","Item continually shocks me, literally. I bought these to use at the office so I could hear my podcasts and listen to music with more subtle nuances (as a musician, I frequently listen to music with a wide dynamic range).
After being shocked multiple times, I contacted the sellers and their response was to tell me that it is not possible for them to shock me, as the piece fitted in the ear is not metal. They say it is likely static build-up.
However, it happens whether there is dry or humid conditions and it is always only the left ear piece. I believe there is likely some strange defect or malfunction, and that causes me to get zapped when the metal does in fact touch my ear. I have since bought a cheap pair of metal ear buds from WalMart for less then half the price, which haven't shocked me once (even in the winter dryness with a space heater next to my chair). Been using the WalMart pair for over two months with no problems and the sound quality is just as good.

Don't waste your money on these. Over-priced for something that isn't any better than a $5 pair and causes physical pain.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These have really good bass when turned up louder. The bass isn't as overwhelming when the volume is low.
I like bass so it works for me. The controls on the cord are responsive and convenient as well.
Came with many variations of replacement and sized rubber ends to the buds. The cord is also a very slick rubberized coating that helps to keep them from tangling. Nice clip included also to keep you from tugging them from your ears when being active.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Unfortunately one of the earbuds cracked after merely 1 month of regular use (either sitting at my desk, or transported in the included carrying case). After reaching out to customer support, they said that the warranty did not cover earbuds and that they don't sell earbuds separately. They did direct me to another vendor for replacement memory foam earbuds, but weren't able to help replace my broken earbud.

Overall, I found the sound quality very good, and was pleasantly surprised that they included a carrying pouch for the headphones, and 4 sets of earbuds with the purchase (3 sets of regular earbuds, small, medium, and large, as well as a memory foam set).  For the price of the headphones, I would say it was still a worthwhile purchase, I was just disappointed with the durability of the memory foam earbuds, especially since those were my favorite fit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The box was nice. And in this case, first impressions really do matter. I was pleased with everything. The headphones were snug inside their protective casing. They also came with a lot of extra stuff, for example they came with different sizes of earpieces as well as some that are memory foam. I am thankful for this additive. They also came with what I assume is a carrying pouch. The material is nice, and is also of really good quality.
The sound quality of the headphones is overall really well. My last headphones were skull candies and I like these a lot better.
The overall quality of the headphones is nice. They are durable, but still feel delicate and nice to hold. The cord doesn't feel cheap.
As far as durability goes, I will update my review when I see that they stop working, but for now I will put them to the test of the everyday college student.

Just an update, these headphones are still working strong. I still love the quality and they have taken a couple of hard drops but have no damage and are still working fine! They are very durable and I am so happy with this purchase. Sound quality is great, but I have discovered the quality depends on the device you are using.

UPS is the spawn of hell.","May 14, 2019","Great product - the price is right for these super durable, super cheap for the great sound quality they give too. If anything, they're a bit heavy on the bass, but you can fix that if you care enough, and I mostly listen to funk anyways so it doesn't bother me. This is just an alert to not ship this via UPS if you can help it. Package got delayed twice - once due to weather in a city with blue skies and sunshine, and again where it sat in a warehouse for a week for no specific reason, and finally came to my stoop two weeks after I bought it with the box absolutely ripped to shreds, and a small, mini-version of the box these typically come in without the foam earbuds I was hoping for, for some reason, was inside. I seriously recommend these buds - I've used some other models of theirs too and they're also good, this is just my fav - but UPS can suck me till I'm dry.

In conclusion, they're a great buy, but avoid UPS like the plague. Would've liked those foam tips that they came with the other times I bought em though...","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However, they are soooooo lightweight that even the tinniest pull of the cord or knock at the earphones and they fall out of my ears, and I have small ears and am using the foam tips so I figure they should be fitting super snugly in my ears and not fall out so easily. Sometimes just moving my head a little bit or leaning back causes them to fall out. Thankfully I just use them at home while sitting at my desk so this isn't a huge hassle. I sometimes work out at home, but haven't tried them out for that yet. I can't imagine trying to use them while walking, running, or working out though...they'd probably fall out every 30 seconds if not more often. But otherwise I really like them. Only real downside when I opened them was there was no L/R lettering to indicate which side was right and left. I just went by the graphic of them being worn by someone on the manual and am using the side with the control buttons on the cord in the right side.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After reading a nice write up on an independent site, I found these on sale at Amazon and ordered them.  I've been using these for a few weeks now and can't recommend them highly enough.  One can tell just by handling these that the quality is far superior than even more expensive ear buds; these are built to last.  The wires are tangle-free, they fit comfortably, and (most importantly) the sound is incredible.  Given the price on Amazon, you have nothing to lose and so much to gain by purchasing these.  Do yourself a favor and get a pair!  You'll be so glad you did.  After years of buying and using disposable ear buds, I've finally found my go-to brand.  Thank you, Betron!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

They had the button controls I was used to, noise-cancelling, comfort, and amazing sound quality. For the price, it seemed way too good to be true. The quality never diminished, and for a few months I was using these everyday. However, these suddenly stopped working one day. It seems like a problem with BOTH the cord and/or the button player. Plugging the headphones in just entails a static noise and it constantly pauses, changes the volume of, restarts, or skips songs. It got too unbearable that I just had to scrap these. And I couldn’t file these with the warranty because you can’t claim it if it has damage involving the cord! Sad to say that I wasn’t even rough with these at all, and my Apple earbuds lasted longer (which says a lot, as those usually break on me after a short amount of time.) Had super high hopes, but dissappointed in the end. I’ll have to find a new pair now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sound quality is sub par, really bright highs and bass is nonexistent, idk why others say it's great.

The sound is clear with even response and not too much bass, also quite efficient for good volume range.  All of the components seem high quality and rugged; cord, buds, plug, control.  I have been through a lot of well-known earbuds for far more money that failed but I anticipate better performance from these Betron YSM1000 headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

First, no sound came out of them when I connected to my Samsung Galaxy Note 4.  According to the specs, they are suppose to work with ALL Samsung phones.  I played and played with them and found that you had to depress the talk button on them to hear anything.  What good are earbuds if you have to hold a button down constantly.  I found a work around, the apparel clip that comes with the earbuds I clipped to the talk button to keep it depressed.

Second, the sound quality was horrible.  It sounded like I was listening to my music in a tin can.  The bass was almost non existent and the highs were extremely tinny.  I have a pair of earbuds that came with a $15.00 Chinese MP3 player, very very basic cheap earbuds, but they are far superior to the Betron earbuds.  These earbuds arrived in a cheap paper box, like you would get from a jewelry store to put the ring box into.  The earbuds were in a ziplock bag in the box.

Third, I contacted their customer support and after sending photo's of the earbuds, they acknowledged that I had received a pair of counterfeit earbuds - stating that their earbuds have their logo on them and that they come in a nice container with their logo on them.  Customer service apologized for what I received and stated that they were going to notify Amazon about counterfeit's being shipped.  They also stated that they would immediately ship me a real pair.

Fourth, 2 weeks later I still have not received the replacements and when I wrote to customer service they said it wasn't their problem.  Amazon shipped them so I had to deal with Amazon.  2 weeks ago they couldn't apologize enough and promised to fix the situation and now it isn't their responsibility.

Horrible sounding earbuds, counterfeit (as admitted by Betron), and no customer support.  Beware buying these earbuds.  If you like tinny music with no base and walking around holding a button to even get sound out of them and spending a lot of money for that, then these are the ones to get.  If you want a quality earbud then don't buy Betron, they don't care about their product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Great Sound and Quality","December 24, 2018","i was looking for good quality sounding set of ""wired"" earbuds for a long flight.  I did Not want wireless ones because i didn't want to worry about trying to crawl around on floor of an airplane if I accidenty dropped one.  I've always been a bit of a snob when it comes to music quality and was an amateur musician for years and been in recording studio.  Keeping things in perspective I don't expect to get studio quality sound from ANY earbuds, wired or wireless, because they are afterall earbuds.  Having said that,  the sound quality is very good and the bass is punchy,  not muddy.  The stereo sound articulation between the individual earbuds is great.  I even plugged 2 sets of these into a Y splitter on my cell phone jack to watch movies with my wife on flights without any notice of loss of volume.
I'm very satisfied, pleasantly surprised from the sound quality.  They do feel like quality materials and made well including the wire which feels thicker than standard wired earbuds.  Not sure if this is due to a thicker guage wire, casing,  or both.  I always keep my earbuds in a small empty hard hair product case with screw top lid when not in use to protect them in my laptop bag from damage so I expect to have these for a long time.  I ordered 2 pairs of these and recommended them without reservation.  I can't imagine you will find anything close to this quality of material or sound at this price point (or probably even higher).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I gave 4 stars but if there was a rating for comfort, I would have rated it a 2. I am a female and the earbuds were still too big to stay in my ear. The ability to adjust the sound volume on the microphone is an excellent idea, and that is why I purchased them, but it made that side of the ear phones too heavy and earbuds kept falling out of my ear. I tried using the clip that came with it and a safety pin, that I had with me, to tie the cords to my shirt and nothing worked. I lost so much of my running time stopping and trying to fine a solution to keep them in my ear that I final gave up and walked my 3 miles. I still like them so I told my husband that they would use them to work out with weights but I wouldn't use them for my runs .
I will stick to the other ""wood"" brand I have purchased on amazon that I would rate as a 5 star in every area for females with small ear canals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Definition-Smartphones-Microphone/product-reviews/B00XBZY0EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
