Carpenter","Nice set of headphones, great sound and seem to extend the antenna pickup range on a cell phone radio, price is good too.","August 5, 2017","It's not the extra bass I liked or the ear hooks to keep them in place when I move about, but the copper wire inside made a better antenna than most of the cheaper earbuds I've used.  At work I listen to local radio and some of my favorite stations I have to move around my cell phone to receive without a lot of static.  These work better than any of the other sets I've used, so to deliver that bass, the wire must be a better quality to supply sound to the drive and likewise the antenna seems stronger.

They come with four different sizes of ear pieces so you can get a comfortable fit, and three sets of ear hooks to keep them in place.  There is alos a microphone to talk when a phone call comes through.  They cords are long so I don't have to keep my phone in my front pocket when using at work.  I tried the bass out too with a track from Iron Butterfly, and the drumwork really came through nice.  I'll have to add some more bass intensive songs to my MP3 collection. Remember these are not wireless, so you do need to plug it in, but that's good if you use the radio tuner on your phone because the wire is the antenna.  Recommended for cell phone users or just those with MP3 portable players.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

It may take a few tries to find the right fit with the ear tips and Arc supporters.

They come with many pieces so you should find the ideal fit for your ears.  The design is also set to keep the headphones firmly in place.  This worked for me but I am well aware it may vary person to person based on the shape of their ears.  They were comfortable and secure for me but just may not do that for someone else.  I also found the sound to be very good.  Certainly not of the superior level but well above most headphones in this price range and the extra bass strongly advertised is no gimmick.  The bass is great.  The reasons I would not use these as my regular headphones all the time is due to the lack of volume control on them as well as due to the fact I now prefer to use bluetooth headphones.  After being spoiled with that needing a pocket or place to keep your phone due to these being wired becomes cumbersome.  But these do work great answering calls and going forward or back with songs.  And the fact they are indeed waterproof is a great plus.  So I am thrilled with these for exercise but they just don't suit my needs for every day, all day use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They produce balanced sound without emphasizing bass or treble. Contrary to the claim of having extra bass, my experience with the earphones so far more flat. They are very comfortable to wear and in my opinion don't need the arc support. They fit in my ears just fine with one of the smaller rubber sizes. The earbuds come with an assortment of sizes for the arcs and the in-ear buds. I'm confident you'll find a size that's comfortable for you. The button on the remote when used on the GS8 pauses and resumes whatever you're playing. A handy feature if someone tries to talk to you with the earbuds on. Additionally, the cable is made out of a harder thicker rubber. They don't snag or tangle easily. The packaging claims that these earbuds are water resistant, but I won't be submerging them in water any time soon.

If you're only looking for sound quality, I'd recommend the Sennheiser CX 300. Those don't come with a mic though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

It does work with my iPhone 6 to play/pause music (did not test it with a phone call) but since these are Sports headphones I needed them to work with my iPod.

I can't figure out why, but my old 2011 Monster Isport Immersions work with every Apple device I've ever used, and it's a full 3-button ControlTalk remote... but newer headphones (including the new version of the Isports) do not work with an iPod Shuffle, and at best only one button works with iPhones.

Prior to these Sony headphones, my favorite was Bose soundsport. The Bose had great sound, and great fit for running.  However, two sets of soundsports both failed the same way over ~5-6 years. The insulation on the cord of the Bose fails as it ages and then this shorts out the headphones.  There are many complaints about the Bose cord, see reviews. This time around I was not going to buy a 3rd set of Bose headphones.  I tried these Sony's, Sennheisers, and Koss.  Of the three, these Sony's have the best combination of fit and sound. The Koss sounded great, but lacked a good fit for running and kept falling out. The Sennheisers had a better running fit with a hard 'hook' but didn't sound as good, and the fit was still not great. The Sony's have multiple soft hook sizes and bud tips. I found them to fit great and sound great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I've not been to a gym for years.  I don't like sweating.

That being said, my husband does exercise regularly, so I can draw upon his experience and my distant memories from when I was fit to assist with this review.

These have some definite pluses for their intended use:  it is great that they are water (e.g. sweat) resistant.  They also come with a variety of tips and earhooks to ensure that they stay in place while exercising.  The bores are very long and weighted towards the end that does not go in the ear, so the hooks are a must.  A shirt clip and mesh carrying case are also included.

The downside to these is the audio quality.  They definitely have ""extra bass,"" so much that the bass is overpowering and bleeds heavily into the mids.  The bass is not clean; it has that artificial ""bass boost on"" quality of the old Sony cassette Walkmans.  In a noisy gym, the thumping bass might be an advantage with the right playlist, but I would never choose to listen to these at home.  These are not horrible expensive but nor are they cheap; my recommendation would be to buy a bunch of KZ or other ChiFi IEMs instead of one set of these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

It would have been much better if they had put the mic much closer to one of the headphones, instead of so far down on the cable.

Normally in-ear headphones are difficult as they fall out. I've tried many brands, but most of the time they loose the seal and that's pointless for these types of headphones. I'm no audiophile, but do appreciate good sound. I read the reviews on these Sony's and thought I'd give it a shot. Glad I did. I did change the rubber earbuds to the small size that comes in the set. They stay in my ear while working out (jumping jacks, squats, pushups, etc.) The winged arc supporters are amazing and simple and really works. And the sound -- well they sound great to me.

 The headphone rig itself, with an installed set of earbuds and clips
 Two more sets of ear clips, in different sizes
 Three differently sized additional ear buds set
 Two cord clips
 One small mesh bag for it all

When they came out of the box, there was one Medium ear clip on one, and one Large on the other; it’s unclear if this is intentional or inattentive packing.  Also, the clip for the left was mounted on the right, and right was mounted to the left.  That can’t be intentional, right?  Pay attention to it when pulling it out of the box, to make sure it’s set up right.  And if not, make sure you pay attention to the instructions for putting on the clips; it’s not intuitive.

Fit: the ear clip thing is just about totally counter-intuitive to me.  It took me a while to figure out the clip size, and then the earbud size.  So, you can’t just start using these right out of the box, at least not in the way they are intended.  You have four choices in the earbud tip size, and then three size choices for the in-ear clips.  You have to do the earbud tips first, to get the fit right in your ear canal.  Then you have to take these buds off to get the right size/fit for the in-ear clips.  All of this took me a good 20 minutes to suss out.

Another fit issue is the inadequate length of the cords from the Y split to the earbuds. I don’t have a particularly large head or face, but there is not enough play from the molded plastic block where the joined cords split into the two separate cords.  I don’t really get this, how Sony could manage to screw up this basic aspect of fit.  Another two to four inches of free single cord is needed.  This single aspect of this product brings it down a full star rating, as I cannot use these comfortably; they keep getting pulled out due to the short cord.

Sound: well, this is what it’s all about, and this product makes the cut.  The box touts “Extra Bass,” but I’m not hearing it.  The bottom, mid, and high ranges come through clearly, with good separation.  With the phones fitted properly and tightly, outside noise is minimized and the sound reproduction is good, clear and crisp.  I ran most of the songs on my “Bassic” playlist and while the sound was good on all auditioned tunes, I just wasn’t really hearing any extra bass.

The multi-function button worked just fine on my phone to answer a call, and on m iPod the single tap paused and resumed play, with the double-tap skipping to the next track.

Documentation: As a Sony product, you get ample paperwork.  You get a detailed limited warranty, with plenty of contact information if you have a beef.  You also get a fold-out set of operating instructions in English, French, and Spanish.  The text is excellent, as are all of the diagrams and their annotations.  Pay attention to what they call the “arc supporters,” what I’ve been calling the “ear clips.”  There is a total of three sets, small, medium, and large, and each marked left and right.  There are specific instructions for installing them on the set, so make sure you get it right.

Price: The current price of approximately $47 seems fair for the product and what it does, noting my complaint about the cord length in Fit, above.

Bottom line: This is a nice set of sports/active earbuds, with a slightly confusing clip system to keep them in your ears a little better.  While the cord length to the ears is surprisingly short for an adult set of phones, the sound is adequate","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The bass response is great and they will stay in your ears with no problem but there's not a lot of mids.  I listen to a lot of Metal, Techno, and PsyTrance so the lack of mids is a letdown.  These are definitely built for the people who like rap music.

Also worth noting, there is no volume control so you have to manually adjust the volume on your phone which is a big deal if your phone/iPod is in your run pack.

Warm, gobs of bass. I’d had the $99 Bose, which sounded nice, but I went through three pairs that all died in about a year. Sound quality, build, and comfort are all superior on these Sonys. I’m no audiophile, but I am a musician. And I just wanted a decent-sounding set without having to shell out a lot. Love these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Solid specs.","June 28, 2018","I needed a replacement for my Razer Hammerhead Pro. And after reading about the current situation with earphones, I got this one.

Pros:
1. Price (Razer Hammerhead was 3x with... no extra benefit)
2. Technical specs (Decent unit driver. Nice on low frequencies. Noise reduction as a bonus.)
3. Built-in mic

Cons:
1. Cord too short and too frail. (I pray I don't force unplug it one day. I know it will break.)
2. Cheap packaging is cheap.
3. No volume control. (Will live without one. In fact, happy that it didn't have one. You know why? None of the head/earphones I have used didn't bug.

They stay in when I run. They’re comfortable. They have great sound and full bass.","June 15, 2018","Finally. They fit. They stay in when I run. They’re comfortable. They have great sound and full bass.

I used to have Sony vertical side-firing folding headphones (for years.) Perfect fit. Perfect sound. Then one side died and that was it. Can’t find them (discontinued.) They were something like the Sony MDR-A35G. (You’ll see how much folks are charging for these discontinued headphones.)

So I tried the Koss KPH14W Side Firing Headphones. I should have believed the reviews. Uncomfortable as heck. Left side ok. Right side was trying to burrow into my brain. Hurt the top of my head too.

Tried the new iPhone buds that come with the iPhones. Great sound but they don’t really want to stay in my ears.

So I gave these a chance. Really glad I did. Gotta screw them into your head a little (well I do,) to make sure they stay in and that you get the sound you’re supposed to. Comfortable, great sound, worked while running - no adjusting during the run at all. There’s also an inline button so you can answer calls. I use it with a clip-on Bluetooth adapter that makes them hands free and I don’t need the button on the headphones.

Comes with several in-ear earpieces as well as a few different arch thingies that help them stay in. All silicone and comfy. Also an optional clothing clip, a little storage bag, and some other doohickey I honestly haven’t looked at yet (maybe for winding/storing the cord?)

Anyway I think you’ll like these. They’re a bit more expensive but worth it for the superior fit and sound. Get a Bluetooth lapel-type adapter and who needs Bluetooth headphones?","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I traded in a pair of ear phones that connected to the phone because with a leash and keeping my iPhone in a purse as I walk or trying to take pictures, it could some times be a hassle.

Labye","Fantastic sound, but uncomfortable (just me though)","August 22, 2017","Hands down, for the price, these earbuds are fantastic...great bass sound, but it doesn't overwhelm mids to highs in the least.  For under $100, you can't do much better and these will rival earbuds that are OVER $100 easily.

My big issue, however, are the appurtenances poking out that are intended to secure the earbuds in place.  I, unfortunately, suffer from having a right ear that doesn't negotiate with these very well so it's uncomfortable for me to borderline painful in my right ear as the ""hook"" (as soft and pliable as it is) just causes irritation from the pressure that it exerts.  Unfortunately, the smaller one is just too small.

That said, I don't want to unfairly dock it because I have this problem with EVERY sports set and I was hoping that these would be the exception rather than the rule...unfortunately for me, they are definitely ""the rule"", but they work as intended.  Beyond that, it's a beautiful set and Sony has started earning my trust again on relatively affordable yet good-sounding headphones/earbuds again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Also Sony seems to provide the smallest canal pieces which my ears need. But these new headphones have taken thing up another 2 notches!

First, they are more responsive so will go much louder than my previous pair.
Second, they fit really snug in my ears and the little hook does a great job of keeping them in.
Third, the bass is definetly more powerful in these. The trebel also sounds cleaner. This is probably reinforced by the really snug fit because you need a good seel to hear the bass.
And fourth, the buttons work with my Android!! Finally!

I have 2 criticisms but don't get me wrong... I LOVE these earbuds!

The increased bass is almost getting into the muddy boomy territory. Some people want that... Most audiophiles want clean and quick bass response.
Also, the cord feels stiff and cheap. All of my previous Sony headphones have had very smooth and flexible cords. I wish these were the same.

But again these are minor issues. I doubt I could find anything better even in the sub $200 range. These are a tremendous value!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Have purchased at least 6 over last 10 years- some for others, most for me. I purchased the MDRXB510AS/B to replace the XBA-1, which I lost... I use Sony's only for work-out and backup when travelling (Bose for music and phone calls). I immediately returned the MDRXB510AS/B due to poor sound quality. Too muffled and lack of fullness compared to price- these are worth $10-15 IMO. Looks like Sony has not only dropped volume control but I don't see any headphones that still have a foam insert inside the changeable earbud covers.

Since the earbuds are waterproof and washable, I been wearing this for exercise and commute because I know the earbuds won't be damage by rain or sweat. But that's all the good things I can say about the earbuds. The sound quality is very subpar for the price range. The earbuds sounds very muddy, and I can clearly hear the ""hissing static"" from the earbuds during the quieter tracks or just leave the earbuds plugged in my device. This problem could be caused by the ""Extra Base"" default EQ in the earbuds. They must tuned the bass so high that the bass makes everything sounds muddy. Even though I'm satisfied with my purchase because I have a purpose for the earbuds, but I cannot recommend this earbuds in this price because I heard earbuds with better sound quality under $20.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

This app interfered with my media player, and it was this app's notification that I saw on my watch instead of the player's. And there are no track names, album names, and any other additional features that my player shows. This really didn't work for me, so I had to return the earphones.
Another big issue is the multi-function button. Since there is only one button, all possible functions are represented in one, two, or three clicks, which you can reassign using the aforementioned app. Maybe it's just me,  but it was very rare I was able to do three clicks without issues. You must be very sure-thumbed to be able to click three times in a row with exactly same intervals. So most of the time the earphones understood my three clicks as two and one, or one and two, messing up everything. In several days that I had this earphones, I wasn't able to master the three-click.
Other than that, the sound is OK. Exactly what you'd expect from $30 earphones. And they sit in the ears very comfortably.","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Great if you want to listen to music which doesn't have a wide variety of sound like rap, podcasts, folk.

Its very very uncomfortable, and I have not even ran with them in yet and unsure i will because I'm certain they wont stay in. I have used them so far mainly to play pubg on my phone, and can hear noises very well, until they fall out.  Also the clip falls off the cord all the time. Its not even being moved much and Ill take the headset off and then spend a few seconds looking for the darn clip. Heck even the pud and the piece that is supposed to hold it in the ear has fallen off.

Because of how low durability Apple earbuds are I decided to try some new earbuds to see if there was a better product for more or less the same price.
I stumbled upon these and thought, “Samsung must make pretty decent earbuds. And for 40$?, must be worth it” to be clear, I don’t like the little gel covers that go into the ear, so I’m biased from the start.
After almost a month of use this is what I’ve concluded. The product has potential but for 40$ this is not worth it. To put it simply, they just aren’t consistent. One reason I stuck to EarPods is because I could always get a “full” sound. Whenever I used other low price point earbuds I always felt like the sound was missing something. It didn’t feel like it was all there, if that makes sense. The same applies here, but not all the times, and that’s the issue. In order to get that “full” sound, you quiet literally need to shove these all the way into your ear. The issue with this is that In doing so you might hurt yourself if you push too far in, and the earbuds slip out too easily to get this sound. Although advertised as “sport” these earbuds slip out very easily. The only way I can ever get this perfect sound is when I’m sitting completely still. If I walk or move at all they slip out in the slightest causin the sound quality to drop. The slightest bit of sweat or ear wax and they won’t stay in place. You might think, “but they come with ear tips” yeah, those stay in your ear, but the earbud tip still slips out slowly and it’s rather uncomfortable, also, the eartip rests on the outside of the ear canal, which prevents the earbud from not fully going in, creating that not “full” sound I mentioned. I usually have to wrap the cord around my ear before putting the earbuds in for a more right, unmoving position but that does very little for help. Also, for some reason it seems that the larger gel covers = better sound quality. So if you find smaller gel covers more comfortable, too bad, you lose sound quality. One of my very nit picky complaints would be this: a 40$ pair of earbuds should have volume buttons. Also, the earbuds stick out a lot from your ears. It was actually the first thing someone commented about mine. They said it looked absurd. After my time of use I have had one instance where the earbuds decided that they wouldn’t be responsive and all they did was randomly blast the volume, or not play sound at all. It hasn’t happened since, but for only a month of use it doesn’t seem too good for the long run.

On the positive, the quality of the cable seems to be durable.

Overall, if these headphones didn’t slip out of the ear and disrupt that “full” sound, I’d love these. I actually believe that they rival, if not surpass the Apple EarPods in sound quality when they’re at their best position. The bass that is advertised can really be heard and it’s an amazing experience. I don’t believe these should be advertised as sport since you can’t move a muscle with these on.

My final thoughts: I don’t NEED to return these, but if I could, I would go buy some EarPods instead","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I don't like a lot of sony products but one thing they have always made well is their headphones.  From old school mdvr's to newer stuff.  These headphones are newer models of their sports one.  The soft silicon ear hooks on these are much improved over ones that you could get from 3rd parties.  They work good for staying in your ear while cycling or running or who knows what you are doing.  The part where they are full of crap is calling them ""Extra Bass"".  They are not even close.  They just sound like normal headphones.  If you want ""extra bass"" headphones then get the MDR-XB50AP/R's  Look them up on amazon and even look at the differnece in driver size.  The mdr-xb50ap/r BASS! but it's not all muddy mush bass.

It's not great but it's not terrible either.
Plugging these in (Standard stereo headphone jack btw) I noticed an immediate difference.
First of all when they say extra bass they mean it. But instead of a muddy bass it's clean and smooth. On top of that you dont lose the mids and highs.

The mic is pretty average but it does the trick. People talking to me can hear me fine but they can tell Im using the mic.

The fit is adjustable, the kit comes with multiple bud sizes and inner ear inserts so you can customize your fit and the material they use is really comfortable and flexible.

I still dont like them in the gym. I hate having a cord around my neck or dangling from my face. They do include an attachment you can use to shorten the cord considerably but... it's still a cord.
That said I lift for about an hour and work up a solid sweat. So far no issues.

Overall.
For the Gym I'll stick to my bluetooth earbuds. But for walking and hanging out while listening to music these are my new goto headphones.

Solid Set. I recommend them if you're looking for a corded set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Carry them with me in my pants pockets every day.  They are very durable and waterproof under normal circumstances (heavy rain and sweat, but don't go swimming haha).  Good sound quality and good microphone makes them very good for phones.  The ears seal well to keep out background noise (essential since I travel by subway a lot) and they stay in my ears where most (especially default Apple EarPods don't).  Cord is generous length to accommodate my height without being so long that it catches on things.

It loses a star for not having volume controls on the button on the microphone!  That's a very helpful feature so I don't have to reach for my phone to make volume adjustments!

They have the ear pieces to fit in your outer ear and even without them, they fit pretty well. But most of this stuff you could find in the description. Here's what you need to know: for 30 bucks, these earbuds put out some sound. As far as volume, I'm listening to them right now at about 75% on my iphone and that's about the max I could take without hurting my ears and I listen to my music loud. I grew up with a father who breathed 70s and 80s classic rock, so I usually turn up my music louder than most people can handle. These earbuds still sound great, and there doesn't seem to be too much distortion even at full volume, although I can't put them directly into my ears because as I said, they would hurt. They seem to block sound pretty well, although not much depending on volume. To me, they sound great. I'm sure you could pick them apart, and I know they don't sound near as good as the $1200 Bose stereo system my parents have sitting in their living room, but I'm a broke college student and these things are $30 bucks and have 12mm drivers; you get what you pay for. I can't say much about the durability because I haven't had them long, but I was definitely impressed by the sound. I got these because I didn't really have any earbuds left that worked. I had a pair of Apple buds that only the right ear piece still worked in. I bought the Anker Soundbuds Sport to get a pair of wireless earbuds for cheap that I could wear while running and talking on the phone. The problem is that their battery only lasts so long. Anyways, I needed a pair of wired earbuds. I thought about a super cheap pair, but I saw these and decided to give them a try.

I accidentally left em' in my pocket and washed and dried them in my washer and dryer machine at mid heat, and... THEY SURVIVED! Plus no signs of wear either, no sound degradation/distortion whatsoever, as well as no melted parts. Sound quality is better than any earphones I've ever had bass is impeccable mids and highs are really good too, bass doesn't bleed into mids or highs, doesn't sound muddy like beats but still give exceptional bass response.

BREAKDOWN:

DURABILITY - 11/10

SOUND - 10/10

COMFORT - 9/10

INLINE CONTROL - 8/10

Overall I'd recommend these to anyone who want exceptional earbuds for a stellar price.

EDIT:The earbuds died a few months after the washing incident.

Will not remove a star because I think that these are still truly amazing buds, after all they aren't rated for waterproof anyways and still lasted months! Get a pair, take care of em, and I'm sure they will last years.

Overall is still 10/10. GET THEM!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

These earbuds are clear, loud, and have great bass. You'll never get better sound for this price, and they blow beats, bose,and many other high priced earbuds out of the water.

This was a good choice.","January 30, 2019","These Sony MDRXB510AS/B Extra Bass sound great! Clear, crisp sound with a rich, little extra, not overpowering base. It easily produces the lower frequencies on my ""test track"" songs that some other headphones fail on. If you have it, it's worth the extra $10 more than $25 headphones. Good microphone for phone calls. Thick wires seem much more durable than my previous 2 pairs. Waterproof. There's some cons, like only 1 button instead of 3. The magnets are big, so they're a little heavy on the ear. Mine are already broken in by my bluetooth ear buds. The hooks work good though. They come in the standard 3 sizes and hold on great to my cauliflower ear.

If you're in analysis paralysis trying to choose between your top 5 possibilities, these are a great choice. Drop the extra $10 and go to sleep. This from an AKG/Koss and Brainwaves customer. Those are good too, just these are a quarter notch better with the bigger magnets. Especially since these are waterproof and have thick cables to last longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I consider myself an audiophile, so I approach buying earbuds/headphones without listening to them first with extreme apprehension. I also have spent years being a bit of a quality snob, usually filtering out anything sub-$100 on the assumption that they aren’t worth my time.

Well, I saw the writing on the wall for my trusty earbuds and decided to replace them before an overseas trip. Good thing I did, because no sooner did I make the order than my old buds died. After some searching I choose these because I was on an extreme budget and recognized the “MDRXB” from a pair of over ear headphones I got years ago that are my absolute favorite headphones of all time. Comfortable as all hell and absolutely bone-rattling bass. Figured I didn’t have too much to lose, so I’d give them a shot.

Once again Sony delivered. These may be my favorite earbuds of all time. First of all, they are insanely comfortable. The default silicon buds fit my ears like a glove, which is never the case! And once they are in, they are IN - never do I get the urge to touch, fiddle, or re-seat. In fact, once they’re in I can forget they are even there. I wore them across the Atlantic and back like they were nothing. I wore them for 10+ hours a day while filming like they weren’t even there, and wear them all night during overnight shifts at work without an ounce of discomfort or readjusting.

The earbuds do a good enough job of noise cancelling to let me sleep on the plane and hear what I was recording over a wedding band, are surprisingly light weight yet sturdy as hell with a thin but tough and textures cable, and come with a very convenient cable management piece, carrying pouch, and shirt clip (which I will admit got lost after a few days - be careful).

When it comes to sound quality, I’d put them up against anything I’ve tried. I’ve had earbuds that cost 5 times as much that are on equal footing with these bad boys. Wonderful bass, full, rich sound. As an audiophile I have zero complaints, and in terms of bang for the buck I’m absolutely floored. I intend on buying a few of these to make sure I always have a backup. There’s really no reason to skip these headphones considering the quality to price ratio.

The only downside, aside from the easily lose-able clip, is no volume control on the line-in remote. But honestly, that’s a minor thing, and for sub-$40, a fine sacrifice in the face of how incredible every other feature is. If you’re considering a high quality pair of earbuds that will make you look at inexpensive headphones differently - GIVE THESE A TRY!

UPDATE: Two months in and still great. However, they seem to randomly spaz and stop whatever I’m listening to, like the button was pressed even though it wasn’t. A minor issue, but still worth noting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB510AS-Headphones-Sweatproof-Comfortable/product-reviews/B01MTEU4V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

It is now September and they stopped working correctly today on my run.  The sound stopped coming through correctly, so I could only hear parts of the songs.
