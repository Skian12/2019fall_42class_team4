Quality packaging. No real (active) noise cancellation going on and none expected at this price point. No volume control/mic/track change, etc. (which is just what I wanted: no doo dads, no unnecessary queries with Siri, etc.>>>just a quality music listening device when you find yourself away from regular speakers). Size selection for ear pieces (s/m/l+ set of foams). Clip included (nice touch). And yes, the cords are thought out>nice and flat making them easier to keep straight and not tangle. Even a small drawstring carry pouch.  For the $, this is a nice set of basic buds..quality is everywhere and tolerances are tight..when you put the 3.5mm end onto your Apple dongle, you push firmly and then there is a noticeable click-no slop or sliding around, etc.
A mention on the ear buds and sizing: proper fit is critical for good sound-especially bass. Play around with not only how you put position the bud in your ear, but also the size of the ear piece fitted to the bud itself>if you don't have a good fit the bass will definitely be lacking..  Fitting the ear piece on/off the bud can be a tad challenging (those dang tight tolerances again), but worth the time to get it right-don't rush it. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Very low quality and cheap. The bass is overwhelming and distorts the sound for all audio, doesn't matter if it’s a video or a song. When I put them in I can hear the drivers being moved around and making a crinkling sound, and very quickly the left one became quieter than the right. The foam tips they came with seemed awesome at first until one got stuck in my ear! It was a terrifying experience! After one week I stopped using these because they are just plain terrible. I accidentally used them today, quickly remembered why I stopped using them, and decided to write this review.

2. MOST FRUSTRATINGLY, the earbuds do not stay in the ears. My girlfriend thought this was the case because of her ear shape (normal), but it also fell out of my ear (also normal ear shape). Literally within 1-2 min of putting the earbuds in, they would be nearly/falling out and I would have to shove them back in. If they're not in the ear, then they're certainly not noise cancelling.
3. The cord is wide and flat, not thin and cylindrical. This is just a personal preference, but I did not like the way the cord felt.
4. Why spend this money. Either get a cheaper pair of cheap ""noise canceling"" earbuds, or spend more money for something that actually works. This is just a waste of money imo.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I took off and star because when I put them on snugly, and create a seal in my ear with them, it actually mutes the sound, so I have to put the buds in my ears loosely and they fall out more easily. Also, I have problems with the shape as I can't lay down with these on because they stick out of my ears too far and it pushes on them. They are noise cancelling; my husband has to yell my name to get my attention when I wear them. I also am not taking off any stars for this, but I didnt realize they don't have a mic or button on them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Wow, now the base sounds excellent.  Not boomy but quality.  It is important to have a good fit to get the full base effect.  The mid tones and the highs are also as good.  When testing earphones or earbuds I usually go to one of my albums that has  good quality base, mids and highs.  This album is called Fourplay and the number is Max-O-Man.  With the proper fit this model is a pleasure and I am enjoying listening to all my favorite quality albums.  My ears are 78 yrs. old and if they sound good to me they should sound much better to younger ears.

But even while it did work, the sound quality was not the best, but I was used to it. So I wasn't prepared for what I was about to hear when I tried these earphones. Wow! It's difficult to remember the sound quality I was hearing back when I had my old Surround Sound stereo, but to me, these earphones remind me of that stereo system again. Quite amazing! I hope these will last me a long time. I plan to update this review later to report how long they are lasting.

They arrived quickly, are well packaged, look good, come with nice accessories, and have good sound quality- until I move my head.  I purchased them to use with a ""silent guitar"".  When I move my head or shift my body while playing the cord rubs against my shirt, or jacket, and the rubbing sound is quite noticeable through the headphones- definitely not what I was expecting.  The cord is a soft rubber and doesn't slide smoothly across anything with texture.  I tried using the clip that comes with the earphones, but that didn't help, I tried positioning the cord a couple of different ways- again without success.  I suppose if I jacked the volume up on the guitar, or played heavy metal, I might not notice the rubbing  sound, but its definitely there with finger picking. So, I'm returning them, though at a cost- I had to pay shipping both ways.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The other headphones I have tried before these from Betron left a lot to be desired when it came to noise cancellation and sound quality. So, I ordered a pair and thought for the price I couldn't get hurt even if they weren't all that. They arrived in the two days allowed by my Prime membership and I was pleasantly surprised how well put together they are. They actually have some weight to them compared to comparable headphones. I used them fort he first time the next day when I started the mower up. WOW!! Not only did they cut the mower noise down to a whisper, the sound that comes from these headphones is amazingly loud with excellent quality. I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend them to anyone searching for a great set of headphones. The only thing that makes these things any better is the price. Very economical.

They feel well constructed, come with a number of varied earbud tips; including a sound canceling foam type that I haven't quite been able to keep in my ear solidly enough to make it work to it's full potential (I have pushed them and held them into place to see how well they will block noise, which they do quite effectively.), and also a clip to help hold the wires in a way as to prevent the earbuds from falling out due to wires being pulled from varying pull stressors, such as when the mp3 player is held in ones pants pocket and gentle but constant pull created from that scenario while walking or working. Flat sealed wires are seemingly far more resistant to tangling, though obviously not impervious to the curse. Overall, vary satisfied.

Keep in mind, I'm not an audio fanatic; so if you aren't one as well you most likely with be very satisfied with your purchase as it's comfy, solid, inexpensive, and outputs a good clean range of sound. If you're a Noise Marine though, these may not be for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are mighty little earbuds.  I ordered these when my last pair of earbuds died (an old pair of Apple earbuds), which I used for listening to music, etc., at work on my phone or computer.  With my old pair, I needed the master computer volume turned up all the way, and then the app volume at about 75% to listen comfortably.  Not these!  I turned the master volume down to 50% and the app volume at 50% for the same sound level.  Lots of sound out of these, with great bass and crisp high end.  The bass sometimes is TOO good and drowns out some of the midrange, but overall very good deal for ten bucks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Impressive for the Price and HIGH QUALITY sound","November 28, 2018","I have gone through a lot of headphones. From $200 Bose (wired/wireless) to $100 Beats. But nothing beats the simple wired headphones. I produce music and listen to a lot of music and these earbuds do the trick.

If you're looking for simple headphones with high quality sharpness, these are the best for the price you are paying. The frequencies are all flat, so you get music and sound as its suppose to sound. Nothing on the Low end (Bass) is altered. And you can hear bass and all on these headphones. Very crisp and punchy sound. Does not sound cheap.

In fact, I can compare these earbuds to Sennheisers Earbuds which range from $75-$100... and they sound just as good almost the same.

... Think about that:
$10 Headphones = $100 Headphones

It comes with a nice bag to put them in and alternate ear pieces (Sm, Med, Larg). The packaging is impressive. It looks like you got expensive headphones.

Overall: If you don't want to spend more than $10-12 on good headphones these are awesome. I don't know about the longevity of them because I just got them. But I'll update the review once I see how long they last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

My Sony's started shorting out after 10 years. I gotta be honest, didn't want to invest more than $10. These Betron DC950's were well reviewed.

Let me say the positives first - they look good, feel o.k., and are solidly built.

The negatives - the sound is a'ight. Wasn't too worried about noise cancellation at this price point anyway. But I had some skull candy's at this price point many years ago that had better sound quality.

All in all - they are a solid 3 stars for price point and durability of the ear plugs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

As a replacement for my Omar earbuds that broke after a while, I very much enjoyed these earbuds for their sound and durability. Regarding audio quality, it's serviceable; I mainly used this for rock, the sound quality excels at low bass notes and really catches some of the guitars and vocals. However, I think the worst parts of these earbuds are the instances when the vocalist sings a high note or you turn the music all the way up, the speakers will give and will unpleasantly start to peak(clip). This problem is very apparent if you listen to classical music, or like to play your music loud. Regardless, a purchase well worth your money. I would recommend this as a back-up, or something you would want to bring on a vacation or in a travel bag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

My experience with buds under $20 (that's all I buy!) is that perhaps 40% lack punchy bass, 40 % lack any presence or highs and 20% are absolutely flat and missing lows and highs.

However, I noticed that the efficiency seems to be higher than most of the other buds I have been using. At least a 6 db increase in volume over the Skull Candy and a few others.  Have not tested with equipment but I suspect that the power band is pretty flat across the entire spectrum.

I had been buying Skull candy Inkd around $12 and they would last about 9 months or so before I would destroy the connector etc.

The flat rubber cable used with the Betron DC950 appears to be pretty durable and preferable to the plastic leads used by most others.

For the money sonically I would give these a strong 4 plus. Mechanically also a 4.0
By the way, this was a second choice product for me. The Model I wanted to order was a Betron also. Special sale at about $13.95 (Amazon) YSM1000.

I took a phone call and to my dismay as went to finish my order the supply went to zero. a day a later I check again and that same set of earbuds was around $40!  YSM1000. Today now $13.95!

I wonder how they compare? Unfortunately, I can only budget for only about $15 a year for buds!","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

But the sound quality is rather unpleasant. The bass is unclear. It sounds dark and muddy.
Virtually no clarity, indiscernible mids or highs. For the average listener this can be problematic ESPECIALLY if your music selection is not bass heavy. For classical, jazz, souls or adult contemporary music - these headsets will leave you woefully disappointed.
I've heard similarly inexpensive earphones that offered a much more balanced sound.

Sound quality is good with better bass than most, especially at this price point, but there is no volume control on this model. No sound bleed at normal volumes, when using the correct size ear pads, with slight sound bleed at higher volumes if close by. Noise cancellation is good, though not perfect.

To Beltron's credit, I don't have anything negative to say about these ear buds.  I only wish I had purchased the model with mic and vol control but my first buy was a test based on other reviews. So far these have been the highest quality earbuds I have ever purchased and at a fantastic price, and I have purchased other at a much higher price with worse quality.  I will purchase another pair or two from Betron as I hike a lot and use them constantly.  The selection of earbud jels and the inclusion of the noise isolation covers, the clip, and a product pouch for storage are only second to the tangle free cable, which it is, and the reason I purchased them. Obviously they can still wrap but they don't lock or tie themselves in a knot, so MUCH better than those I have used in the past.  Lastly, I use these buds for both music and movies, and while I am not an audiophile, to me the sound quality is very good!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Pros:
Decent sound quality
Good price
Seemingly pretty durable
Come with a clip and a bag
Multiple nub sizes included for good fit

Cons:
No built in volume slider

That's pretty much the assessment of it, and the lack of volume slider hasn't really affected anything, unless you're using it with an app or game that makes it problematic to change volume.

However, I, unfortunately, have smaller ears than most so I'm always betting on it to fit snug into my ears every time I get new earphones. They were too big for me even if I changed the earpieces to the smallest one that was provided. The sound from these earphones, I think are decent but again I couldn't get the full experience because they didn't fit properly. Because of this, the sound would leak, didn't cancel any noise, when I move around in these I can hear the rustling from the cord and the earpieces easily fell out of my ears.

These DC950 are much better in every aspect. They are a nice quality set of earbuds. Cable is high quality and cool looking being red on one side and black on the other. My only slight issue is that the 90deg plug is a little on the large side and the plastic doesn’t easily fit in my iPad case. I will just Dremel out the case a bit so this fits better.

The sound quality is great with nice highs and very deep bass that is boosted a bit, but not too much. Overall it’s a well-balanced sound that doesn’t get tiring to listen to.

They feel like they will last much longer than my previous go-to earbuds (Monoprice HiFi Reflective Sound earbuds).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The audio is clear, which is great for my transcription work. But they are super trebly; there is essentially no mid or low end. Some audio will pierce my ear because of the high pitch, so I'll have to turn the volume down even if it's not all the way up. For music, you will definitely want an equalizer. But there's no fuzz or buzz or distortion; they're very clear for the price, and the red and black looks pretty cool to me.
The buds are comfortable in the ears; I can wear them for hours at a time with no discomfort. I'm on the smallest size, but for my ears I could go one smaller. But they don't fall out, and I just push them in slightly when I need to hear something a little more closely.
Overall, they're great for the spoken word, but you'll want to get a bass booster or equalizer for your music. I'd recommend as a temporary replacement, backup, or travel pair.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Like everyone else, for the money, I was very happy with the sound quality.  Unfortunately, i am not convinced they will last one month.  Immediately I had to wiggle one of the cord lines because I wasn't getting sound through one ear.  It came back, but a second time it began to crackle.  So that part is disappointing and if you wish to purchase these, I would recommend investing in the protection plan.  If I get a year out of any earbuds I am extremely happy.  The Betron's come with a pouch, but I have started to always place my earphones/buds in a tupperware type small container.

I use to have brands that cost me over $100.  Neither lasted a year due to the cheap wiring.  Betron is no different, but placing other brands in a hard case seems to allow them to last longer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

They're destined to fail, and generally, it doesn't take long.  These ear buds haven't failed me after 4 months of heavy use.  Bought several more pairs as backups.  They sound good too.  While they're not noise cancelling, they do help to muffle background sounds.  Another plus is the extra ear cushions they come with (nice diameters!)  CONS:  If the angle of the buds in your ear changes , there can be dramatic changes to sound.  So if you are listening to something while sitting down or resting, great.  On the other hand, if you want to listen to something while cutting your grass, to avoid having to crank up the volume too much, I use 'over the ear' type of ear protection (big & cushioned).  What I've found is that I typically need to make numerous adjustments to the buds &/or ear protection to get everything sounding right.  Once I do, that's pretty much it, but getting there sometimes is a pain.  ALL IN ALL:  Highly recommended.  The pros really outweigh the cons!","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Firstly, noise isolation is wonderful (although I have no previous reference group to compare to, I still find it great). The sound when gaming or listening to streams is a bit tinny to me, but when listening to music the bass seems to kick in wonderfully and seems to produce a deep, full sound--so much so I had my wife come over when I was testing it because it sounded so great. Comfort at first was an issue with these ear buds but after changing out the size of the in-ear rubberized pieces to a smaller one, it felt much better. Previously the in-ears would stick out just a bit too far and the metal pieces on the back of the ear bud would rest pushing against my auricle which after an hour or so of use would begin to cause discomfort. This was ameliorated by using the smaller in-ear rubber pieces, though. The tangle-free cord is absolutely great, the color combination (red/black) looks great, and the overall construction feels strong and reliable. I wish the cord was just a bit longer, but I knew all that before purchasing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wanted to buy the JLabs J5 again but it is no longer available. After looking around at the bewildering number of choices, these seemed to be similar specs & in my price range.

I use these mostly for videos & some music. I am usually static so I can't comment on how they would perform during very physical activities. I use them on my phone & Kindle.

The sound quality is very similar to the J5 I've been using for a couple of years which means subjectively they sound pretty good for earbuds.

I felt the ear cushions on the DC950 are too ""stiff"" & not as comfortable as the J5's. The J5's cord is much lighter & thinner (though 1 did fail & was replaced under warranty) than ""bentron"" cord. Since I'm just sitting there it hasn't been a problem. The DC950 is definitely heavier all the way round.

I still prefer the J5's but since I can't get them any more, I think the DC950 will do a good job & for the price, I would recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

For the past 3 years, I reached a point in my life where I had to constantly buy a new headphone every month. Whether its at Walmart or Amazon, the headphones would just loose sound or the cable would tear apart from twisting in a pocket, getting snagged on a door knob, or being used while alseep.

Lately I tried to search for headphones that market themselves as durable. Last few pairs I tried were from Amazon. ""CHSMONB Bass Stereo Earbuds Headphones"" absolutely weak headphones, didnt last two weeks. Returned it after giving it a deservinv negative review. ""Kinden Durable Headphones"" had similar issues. Complete waste with an awkward design. Explicitly labeled as durable. It's trash. The ""Anker SoundBuds Verve"" was even worse. I was overwhelmed by frustration. I thought to myself; theres nothing good out there.

But these, these are good. I bought it about over a month ago and thought to myself within ten minutes of use, this might be what i've needed all this time. The flat cable design is brilliant, the elbow port is perfect for using a device stowed in a pocket since it redirects the cabling to avoid tension. The earbuds are fantastic. And the cable is remarkably durable for a flat cable and they definately do resist tge wear a rounded cable would have snap under. It also makes it super easier to detangle.

As I sat around using these headphones that have saved me the hassle, i came to realize a positive review was due. Im even a planning on buying extras.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I'm satisfied with the quality. They are well put together, have decent sound quality, and even come in good packaging with multiple different sizes of covers. The quality could be better, but they're earbuds. I won't complain. It's pretty good if you can put them in your ears correctly, but I guess you can say that about any earbuds over 15 dollars. The noise cancellation (WHICH I DIDN'T WANT) was okay. It makes everything sound like your under water. Also if you open your mouth wide while using them, you can hear dampened brown noise. I just thought that was kinda cool. It's about as good as my ignorant self would know about noise cancelling earbuds. One more important thing to note. Due to the design of the wire, it does tangle but can be easily untangled by just grabbing it from two end and shaking and tugging at it. That is if nothing is knotted. This makes it a lot more convenient than earbuds with slimmer wires.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I tried a number of different ones that my friends had, but most of them had something unappealing with them.  The exception were a set that ran $40 and a set of Beltron's similar to these DC950.  For the price, these playback almost as well as the $40 set and better than the original set that came with the MP3 player.
The box comes with three sizes of soft silicone ear pieces.  They fit tight on the earphone post, so changing them out is a bit tricky; but that's good once you wear them in the gym.  They set in the ear comfortably and stay set while running on the treadmill.
Overall, the Beltron units a good value for their price... clear sound production, nice strong bass (which is missing in most earbuds in this price range), and comfortable fit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Even when your not moving, it felt like there were going to easily just fall out with the slightest movement or tug.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

No complaints at all.
I then ordered 2 Betron DC950 earphones for myself and my wife. They are also excellent and in fact, I ordered one more as a spare.  Why?  Although the base is not quite as evident as the BS-10, the noise canceling seems to enhance the quality range fidelity by eliminating external sound influences, and the treble frequencies seem a little better for voice frequencies. Bottom line: Both earphones are great fidelity products, and well constructed. I prefer the DC950 because of the flat, no tangle cord (which really is true!) and the 90-degree angled jack. Both earphones fit snugly into the ears, especially if you loop the cord over the top of your ear. The BS-10 has about a 10-15 degree angle on the bud to perhaps enter the ear canal better, while the DC950 is conventionally straight. Both earbuds fit more or less flush and don't protrude externally = nice designs. It is sort of a toss-up, but for the reasons above, I chose the DC950 for my spare buds. Either way, you will not be disappointed in the excellent construction and fidelity quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I like that the price was reasonable. The only complaint I would have is they stick way out from the ear judging from facetiming my friend when he had them on. 😀 Some earbuds are not comfortable for small ears. He said he had to use the smallest size pad to make them comfortable. I don't know if the non-moldable part digs into his ear at all. Personally, I use earbuds when I'm laying down on my side a lot and if the metal or plastic hard part is too prominent, they become super uncomfortable when sandwiched between my earlobe and the bed. I prefer a low profile, almost flat style bud. Anyways, I just bought these so I can't comment on their longevity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

A bit thicker wire with red and black on both wires which is pointless. If the wires were color coded to know which ear to use, it would make sense. I use them with an iMac DT, so the cable length is important and the ""L"" shape of the connection to the computer back would give me another inch. All earbuds are intended to be used with your phone but I wouldn't mind paying a little more for earbuds with another 6"" added to the cable. These replace another pair of 2 YO earbuds that for some reason one side was at very low volume and with an iMac you can't choose mono output in system preferences.

But my wife sometime falls asleep with her earbuds in, and she has wrecked a few sets of earbuds this way. I wanted to find her a more durable set, and found these here on Amazon. The review were basically off-the-charts, so I decided to get a set each for both of us. WOW! When comparing side-by-side with our old Skull Candy earbuds, these Betrons easily surpassed them. First of all, the bass response is unreal. Rich, deep, and clear. Second, the overall tone and volume are superior. Third, these are solidly built, and the cables seem really durable.

Music quality:
Panasonic has a decent sound - both bass and highs are clear enough. So far, Panasonic are the best among other headphones I had in this price range. Betron is sealing completely air-tight to the ear canal and as a results had pronounced muddy bass drowning the rest of the frequency range.

Wear comfort:
The air-tight fit of Betron I mentioned above makes it rather uncomfortable, it is ironic that despite it Betron headphones are easier to fall from the ear than Panasonic. I’ve been trying various sizes of included ear-buds yet the result is the same.

Convenience for sport/activity:
Betron has tangle free cord, which does tangles less than Panasonic, but the cord is heavy so when you are running the cord yanks the headphones making thumping sound. Both Panasonic and Betron cords have rubberized feeling and tend to catch on the clothing. Also the ear-bud pieces on Betron fall off too easy when wiped and hard to put back - should be the other way around. On Panasonic it is equally easy off and on, not ideal but better than Betron.

Durability:
I had this Panasonic model for quite a while (three pairs) and can tell that the cord is well made and well attached to the buds, but the diaphragm fell off after few hundred hours of use - not a big deal considering the price. I didn’t use Betron long enough to judge its longevity, but it feels well made, slightly better than Panasonic.

Price:
Panasonic is slightly cheaper than Betron.

Conclusion:
Panasonic is better than Betron in almost every aspect, but still have shortcomings, so I’ll be trying other brands…","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I was able to get it to stop erroring out the second time I used them. This is probanly why i reveied an obvious return.

Sound quality 7/10 considering they are ear buds.

Product quality 5/10 for bringing up google assitant when not prompted (thus interrupring the music)

I think its ridiculous that i paid full price for an obviously opened/returned package of ""new"" head phones

I would not recommend them  because the package was torn up when i opened the box and it caused repeated errors on my phone (the unwarranted google assistant).

The only good thing is the buds fit well in mg ears, are somewhat inexpensive, and sound quality is middle of the road.

Would not recommend and i would like a refund or partial refund because  of these iasues

I do not recommend buying these.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wanted something that didn't cover my entire head and make my head look three times the size it was but was still able to give me great sound quality.

I toss these into the output on my Yeti and use the earpieces that were adjusted for my canals. The sound quality was great. The noise cancellation was so-so. I'm more or less feel like because I was able to fit them in my entire ear canal that it just stopped me from hearing more on the outside. I would assume that if I was in a louder area I could still probably hear people in the background. However in my studio of my house, it wasnt an issue.

Overall I would recommend and buy again","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Betron-Headphones-Earphones-Isolating-Tangle/product-reviews/B00LB01FNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was really surprised by these. the packaging was impressive. They seem very well made. i listen to music with pretty heavy bass so i was very surprised when these could handle it. Sound quality is pretty good for the price I would recommend these for people who want a quality earbud for a decent price. I wanted to try a cheaper version of these brand earbuds before spending money on more expensive ones. i will for sure be buying more.

Update
I was very disappointed when i went to listen to music and one of the earbuds no longer works. Not sure what happened because i keep them in the case. I really liked these headphones but i am not sure i will be purchasing these anymore just because they up and quit for no reason.

I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality of these buds. They're comfortable to wear and very light weight. The frequency response is excellent. It's been my experience with many other ear buds that when they say ""Bass driven"" or something similar, the response is skewed to make hip hop, pop and other bass heavy music sound cool to those who may not appreciate accurate response.
