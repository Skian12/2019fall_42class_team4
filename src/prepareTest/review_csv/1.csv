I bought these to have a back up to the ones that came with my iPhone and they are not the same in comparison as far as sound or build quality.

As soon as I plugged these in and fired up Spotify I could tell they were not the same. Tinny, echoey, no base resonance, and they scratch when you touch the controls.

I miraculously found my original EarPods so when these arrived I compared them directly to see whether they matched up. The ones Amazon sent me are just like the ones I got with my phone, and the packaging is just like all my other classic Apple stuff: everything sealed, meticulously held in place, documentation, etc.

Photos below show all the box details and the packaged EarPods. The only thing that seemed slightly different was the thickness of the main cord---these are a tiny bit thinner it feels like (but I got my IPhone7 some time ago so these might be the ""current"" version). As for sound, I can't tell any difference between my original EarPods and these replacements.  My one star off is because the shape of the actual earpiece is not my favorite. That's just preference---or ear size, maybe?

UPDATE: looks like Amazon isn't always offering these as Prime-Exclusive, or at all. I would never go for these if listed by others, new or used. Head to the Apple Store otherwise!","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Right before I had gotten suckered into buying a different brand at half the price -- it had a 5-star review average, but when I looked more closely, after receiving something broken and of poor quality, saw that it was because scammers had flooded the review sections with their 5-stars.  Amazon also removed the scammers of that by the next day and now it is properly a 1.5 star item.  Maybe you can get more expensive brands that sound better, but from reading the real reviewers, it seems that every type of earbud is prone to breakage.  At least these should last a year or two like the rest.  They work fine.  Not awesome  Just as good as the originals.

Not like the pics, I did not have this ""bursting"" effect, but i was able to easily scrape it off after about 5-10 mins.

Instructions:
1. Take a nail file or a buffer and buff off the top clear layer a little (can be patchy if using a file but try to scrape off the majority of the top layer, a corse file works better for this)
2. Brush on a THICK layer of the gel coating the nail entirely.
~*~ Wait 5-10 mins, don't touch!- I like this better than having foil wrapped fingers cause you can still do stuff so the time goes fast~*~
3. Take a metal cuticle pusher and scrape from cuticles up towards tip of nail. It should scrape off pretty easily, if not, scrape off what you can gently and repeat.

Polish comes loose much easier that soaking IMO. Also a lot faster and a lot more eco-friendly (cotton, tin foil, ect.) Taking nails off has always felt like such a production to me but this does make it easier, I would def buy this again over acetone.

It is clearly marked with Apple’s etching of “Designed by Apple in California Assembled in Vietnam” with the model number and a 12-digit serial number at the end of this text. This clearly is proof that it is indeed an authentic Apple product. This makes me feel really good in knowing that I’m only using genuine accessories with my genuine Apple iPhone. The sound quality is amazing with just the right amount of bass level to really emphasize the music but with out drowning out any other tones. To me, there just isn’t anything better than the kind of sound quality you get in genuine Apple EarPods for listening to music. The features on the remote is an added bonus and really makes navigating through my music list so much easier as well as answering. I really love it","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-EarPods-Lightning-Connector-White/product-reviews/B01M0GB8CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

When I recieved this product I immediately started using it since after my last pair broke I had no replacement so I had to use my iPhone without earphones for 2 weeks. At first it seemed like my product was working perfectly fine so I started binge watching YouTube videos to catch-up on most of the videos I missed (mainly asmr videos) however after a few hours I had to unplug my earphones to plug in my charging cable and charge my phone. The next day, I woke up unplugged my iPhone from the charger plugged in my earphones and on my way to school I noticed that the right earphone wasn’t working anymore..
I’ve tried to make myself remember if by mistake I may have pulled the lighting jack a little to hard and ruined the product but I’m usually very gentle about this so I don’t think it was my fault however, not being 100% sure, I can’t accuse this product of being faulty. So to be clear this product worked fine like it was supposed to at first but then didn’t.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Many of the reviews here claim this is not an apple product and that theirs broke too quickly so it must not be apple. To them I say that they are wrong. This is indeed An apple product, as shown in the images. The product is not bad but if you miss handle the headphones they will break.

If they came broken, then it is a shipper / distributor issue and you are likely due a refund.

I’m not an apple fanboy but these headphones work well for facetime and casual use.

The EarPod design is still a huge improvement over the old rounded earbuds, and are easily wiped clean or dabbed with a cotton swab. The proprietary Lightning Connector pin fits securely enough that if you fumble your iPhone, the pods are more likely to pop out of your ears than out of your iPhone. The audio is good, and the volume/button/microphone works consistently. I wish that the wiring was more durable, but considering the price of AirPods, and that most other third-party earbuds would have to plug into the 3.5mm to Lightning adapter, there are no other affordable, easy options for iPhone hands-free users.

I saw that some other reviewers had trouble recieving dud sets or no EarPods at all. The photos here are to attest that I was shipped a legit Apple product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-EarPods-Lightning-Connector-White/product-reviews/B01M0GB8CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I think it’s because the headphones don’t have a sturdy wire... it’s just thin plastic. Other than that, they’re good.

I would not buy these if you are going to do any fast walking or more.

Update:
So after three tries with the EarPods I finally just received a full refund from Amazon. On all three EarPods the left one stopped working right around after a months time. Two stopped working after the return window with Amazon however the Amazon Product Support Expert I chatted with was great.

For working out - see comment about length/slack.

Sound quality - they aren’t the big fancy ones but do the job.

I’d say it does a great job at cancelling out noise since my child always says “I didn’t hear you!”

This our second pair of earbuds. The first pair lasted a few months then one of the speakers popped out - was still connected & could be popped back in but it was a bit of a hassle doing it all the time.

She lost hers, and mine got caught on a gate latch and pulled a kink in it that I expected to short out any day.

They were branded as Apple items, and after a very close inspection, I could find nothing that told me otherwise. They work fine, and they are very comfortable. I have worn these earpods for more than 10 hours a day while traveling, and they felt just as good at the end of the day as they did at the beginning.

I read the reviews, which were very mixed. Several of the people also commented on feeling concerned about ordering from this seller, but decided to give it a try with a good outcome.  So I thought I would also take the chance.  BAD CHOICE  on my account!  The product LOOKS like a Apple product. The came in the usual Apple box, which was sealed, and was packaged exactly the same. They appear brand new, are clean with no viable damage. HOWEVER...., although I can hear just fine through these earbuds, the person on the other end complained of muffling, breaking up, or not hearing anything at all. All within a space if a minute, with no change in location or position.  THESE ARE NOT A AUTHENTIC APPLE PRODUCT.  They did not state that they were reburbished either. So even if they were, to sell them as a NEW item and in a sealed APPLE box was misleading!  DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER!  I don't know where they are getting this product, but it is NOT worth your money or time.  It was a waste for me, and now I STILL need to buy another set of earbuds in order to handle my calls.  VERY ANGERING and disappointing!!  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO COMPANIES (Amazon and others) holding up to the best possible standards and making sure their customers are buying from the best?!  As usual..., it's always about the money...., whether it AMAZON, another company, or one of their seller's....., the standards have gone out the window and consumers are on their own.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-EarPods-Lightning-Connector-White/product-reviews/B01M0GB8CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Focus on the quality it was like and not the quality of when they died if you are gonna review them. And the other reviews saying that they were not working out the box, you should make sure you’re ordering from amazon or apple or go to the accessories page in apple.com cause that should guarantee unopened EarPods. Just because the product you got was bad doesn’t mean the product you wanted is too.

They arrived and appear to be the real deal. I bought two sets of these and compared them to the originals that I had gotten with my iPhone. You can’t tell them apart.
They look, sound and operate in every way - these are authentic Apple Ear Pods with the Lightning Connector. All packaging appears to be legit too.
A good deal for the price.

As far as I can tell, these EarPods are entirely the real deal - the box is the unmistakable Apple designed packaging, and the ear buds themselves look, feels and perform exactly as the OEM that came with my iPhone. IF - on the infinitesimal chance - what I have here is not legit, then they represent a flawless, masterclass in forgery, and are still worth every cent. Either way, I'm very happy.

Side note: I've used noise-cancelling and sound-isolating headphones before, but I really think that EarPods - which have neither of these features - have a solid place. It's often a real advantage to be aware of my surroundings while enjoying music, podcasts, or whatever. I can groove away at my desk without disturbing anyone and still hear my boss ask me a question in the next cubicle.
