It's not great, you get what you get for the price.

First, the sound quality. The sound quality is definitely not audiophile level. It's good for 20 bucks. You can turn the volume up quite loud, but it can't go extremely quiet. Nevertheless, it doesn't leak sound that much. I think that the audio is fine for most people. If you're an audiophile, I don't know why you're looking at 20 dollar earbuds.

Next up, the design and material. I quite like the design of these. The earbuds and ear hooks are black. The rubber piece that connects them is a nice red color. I do have a few complaints. One, the ear hooks are not adjustable. They're flexible and you can bend them however you want, but they don't quite fit around my ears. If you plan on running, I can't guarantee that these will stay in, since I only use the for casual music listening. Also, they are a bit large and stand out a little. After some time using them, I got used to that.

Lastly, the performance. The battery lasts a good few days of constant use. They charge up really fast too - under an hour. To turn them on, you press the power button on the right earbud for a few seconds and it'll beep when connected. The volume buttons are also on the right earbuds. The order is a bit weird though. When wearing them, the volume up button is behind the volume down button. That threw me off a bit. It's nice, however, that there isn't a dangling piece on the wire for the control buttons, which usually make the weight distribution uneven.

I like these earbuds, but if you have a higher budget, I strongly suggest investing in a better pair. I'm not saying that these are bad, Im just saying that for a higher budget, you could probably get something a lot better. If you're budget is tight, these are fine.

EDIT:
For some reason the left earbud now doesn't work. It only works when the rubber wire is in a certain position. You should probably buy the new version instead of this one.

EDIT:
I contacted customer service and they were able to send me a new pair. The communication took a few days because of the different time zone but good customer service nonetheless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However there is a drawback and that has to do with bluetooth. It is a rare occasion when any bluetooth compatible device can see the headphones let alone connect successfully to them. And it doesn't seem to matter if these headphones are the only bluetooth device when you try and connect from a PC or tablet or cell phone (all with bluetooth compatibility).Invariably the headphones are never found and if they are they fail to connect.

The headphones are as pictured and it comes with the case, extra earbuds, and a charging cable. Pairing it with my phone was easy; all I had to do is hold the power button for about 6-7 seconds until it entered pairing mode and it connected easily to my phone. I still haven't tried it at the gym since I just got it, but I tried shaking my head and it didn't fall or even feel like it is going to fall. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the sound quality could be better in my opinion; however, since I'll be using it only when working out, I don't really care about the sound quality as much as long as it is good enough since I already have other headphones that I use when I want to listen to music while I'm chilling or not doing extreme physical activity.  I just hope that it won't fall out of my ears when working out and that it holds up well over time.

I bought them mainly because of their advertised water resistance - I tend to sweat heavily when working out, and have had poor luck with other headphones.

The good: The battery life, and charge time, both seem great. My ""charging habits"", such as they are - mean plugging them in in my car a couple times week when I happen to think about it. Usually for less than 20 minutes. I've never once been caught by a dead, or even low, battery - so that's nice.

They stay in place, for me, very well. No amount of activity, changing position, or running seems to shake them loose - which is another reason I like these, with the small ear-wraps, over the in-the-ear-only ones.

They also pair very quickly and easily - exactly like Bluetooth stuff is meant to.

The bad: Acknowledging the sweat issue, I've had poor luck with reliability on these. My first pair lasted maybe 4 months. I ordered a second pair, figuring I had gotten my moneys worth from the first. The second pair worked once. The very second time/day I went to use them they were totally dead.

Amazon replaced the two day old set with my current pair. They're now about 6 or 7 weeks old, and I'm beginning to hear the telltale crackle I did right before my pair stopped working.

EDIT: To their credit, I followed up with Otium when the third pair finally died a couple months in. They sent me a new pair, under warranty, with very little hassle. We'll see how long the new set lasts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I paid $19, and I can't expect a whole lot more for that price. That said, I rated three stars because these just haven't worked out well for what I primarily bought them for: that is, bluetooth headphones for running.

First, the pros:
- Easy to pair
- Good sound quality
- Comfortable enough wearing around the house
- Pretty decent water-resisting performance (more on this below)
- Nobody's complained about sound quality when I've taken phone calls on these
- Battery life is solid (I can go at least three or four runs without charging)

Cons:
- When I'm running they just don't stay in my ears. I have to wear a headband and pull it down a bit over the buds to keep them from falling out completely while I'm running. Even so, I end up having to push them in and adjust them constantly during my run. Ear shapes are different though, so that may not be the case for everyone.
- They can get really uncomfortable when they get sweaty. For me at least, when sweat gets into my ears, these can suction into my ears really, really tightly and get very uncomfortable. At that point I have to pop them back out and... oh, hey they're falling out again.
- One half of the volume/track change is no longer working. I'm pretty sure this happened due to sweat and moisture exposure. I haven't been particularly kind to these as far as moisture goes, but they are listed as waterproof.
- The rubber connector between the two buds always seems to swing to one side or the other and then catch on my neck and pull out one of the buds if I move my head. Not sure if that makes sense, but the bottom line is that the ""stickiness"" of that rubber connector causes a lot of pulling and discomfort.

The bottom line is that if you want these just as a solid, low-cost pair of bluetooth headphones for around the house, walking around the city, making the occasional phone call, and doing lower-impact sports (like biking maybe?), these could be a good choice. But if you're looking for a pair of running headphones, these may not be the right pick -- your ears are probably shaped differently than mine, and these may stay in better for you, but I've gone through months of frustration trying (unsuccessfully) to keep these in my ears.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

When I would go on a run with normal headphones they would always pop out or my dumb arms would get tangled up in them. These headphones are great for running because they're lightweight and have a piece of rubber which wraps around your ear itself to keep hold. They are a bit uncomfortable at first if your ears aren't used to the plastic fitting that goes in the ear itself, but you will quickly get used to that. As for boxing I use these with music to keep rhythm when shadow boxing or using the heavy bag and they surprisingly stay snug in my ear during the high intensity movements, something other headphones aren't good at doing, plus no stupid cable to get in the way. The sound quality is amazing and the buttons are such a big help so I don't constantly have to pull my phone out and waste time fumbling to get in and change a song or artist I'm listening to. They also seem to handle swear well, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've gone 2 days without needing a recharge, meaning 2 full work outs and listening to music at work for 2 days.

When they are low battery, you might as well stop using them, this is especially frustrating mid workout.  They will continue to beep and tell you low battery every minute or two and then eventually shut off.  There is not way to gauge how much charge they actually have.

The loops to go around your ear are also worthless, they don't even touch you ear and the earbuds themselves stick out about an inch or so from your ear so they look a bit ridiculous.

Overall quality and sound however is good and they do stay in place.  I have yet to do any outdoor runs but on a walk, the wind was definitely an interference.

***EDIT for 1 year use***
I stand by my past review but would like to update even further after almost 1 year of use.  The loops around your ear, I will edit to say, I found if I twist the entire piece back they sit much better.

This update is mainly for their customer service.  One ear bud fell off while I was at the gym, not sure how but it was hanging by the wire.  I contacted Otium and reference their 1 year warranty.  They gave me the best customer service, emailing promptly with updates and I received a brand new pair not even a week later.  I'd buy from them again and again.

Oh, and I have yet to run with them outdoors so I still am not sure about wind interference there.  I'm guessing it should be fine though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I honestly think these would've lasted longer but, like I mentioned, I literally used these every day through my work day.

Green","These are great headphones if you hate music","January 9, 2019","I am not an audiophile. I can't imagine shelling out $100+ on nice headphones. I have an $8 pair of wired Panasonic earbuds that I think are great (minus the annoying cord) -- and indeed, those are my baseline for comparison purposes with the Otium headphones.

The Otium headphones are inferior to my $8 earbuds in every possible way except for the fact that they do not have a cord that gets tangled as easily. The noise that comes out of them is flat and lacks richness. It has plenty of bass -- especially if you turn the volume up -- but it's like they had a meeting and said, ""If we crank the bass, nobody will notice the otherwise-terrible sound quality!"" I was listening to new music and hated all of it because of the quality issues and the small, nearly-imperceptible skips in the playback (I'm on a hardwired fiber connection; it isn't my internet). To say that these earbuds play ""music"" is like calling pasta sauce smeared on a saltine cracker ""pizza."" And again, this is from someone who thinks $8 earbuds are great.

And let's just say I got a defective model, and they don't all sound this bad (I think they all sound this bad; mine sounded bad but not ""holy cow this is defective!"" bad): these are SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE. The only adjustment you can make to the fit is by changing out the rubber tips. That's better than nothing, but since the over-ear piece is entirely non-adjustable, all the weight (and relatively speaking, it is a lot of weight) sits on your inner ears. I don't think I could wear these for more than an hour or two before I'd have to take a break from them. I also find myself wishing there was a joint between the ""ball"" of the earbud and the bulkier, outer-ear piece, which might make it easier to get a better fit.

The good: they came with few extra sets of rubber tips in different sizes, a nice case, a little cord-keeper (to help take up some of the slack in the cord between the ear pieces), and they were packaged in a cardboard box instead of a plastic clamshell (thank you!)

**UPDATE**
The seller contacted me in response to this review to offer to send me a new pair of headphones because I found the first ones so unsatisfactory. They did not ask me to change my review, which I appreciate. I'm not taking them up on the second pair because regardless of sound quality, I don't think they'll be any more comfortable than the first pair, but I appreciate their effort to resolve the issue and have left feedback saying as much on their seller page.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Here's the good and bad. Great battery life, lasts for several running sessions before needing to charge. Provides battery level on my phone under the bluetooth settings. Nice to know battery status, as there is no other indicator.
The sound quality is good.
The buds don't insert far enough in my ear to act as sound canceling headphones, which means they don't work well in loud environments. I use them while running, so they generally work just fine. They do appear sweatproof.
As I said, this is pair #3. My original set stopped working cold after about 6 weeks. I reported the problem and was shipped a replacement pair and received them in about 2 days. Great customer support. I've not had a similar issue with pairs #2 or #3.
My only real issue is the fit. My left ear canal must be ""normal,"" as the bud inserts cleanly and the ear clip holds the bud in just the right place. My right ear must NOT be 'normal' because I never seem to get the same snug fit. Oddly, it fits better when I wear the lanyard in front of me rather than behind my neck. There is no angle adjustment or clip adjustment (as far as I can tell), so after a long run, I find the right earphone begins to slip in and out as I sweat more and more. But it works well enough that for the price, it's hard to beat.
As for why I had to get another pair (pair #3), my second pair was stolen along with my wallet from my car.

Best $20 or $40-50) in-ear Bluetooth headset you'll find anywhere.","July 3, 2017","Ok, Yes, I'm surprised by this little dynamo.

(Updated 7/10/17 at bottom)

I am not a huge fan of most in-ear headsets, so i was already sitting on low expectations.  These came today, even though Amazon said they'd come tomorrow (yes, Jul 4? They deliver?)  Anyway, they arrived.  I will probably mention this again, but these cost $20.

Now, i reviewed over the ear headphones that were sub-par in every category, so these couldn't be any good, right?

Opened the box, a cute little hard case with a carabiner to attach to something.  The headphones, and 2 extra ear bud sizes and a short USB.. So, all the basics and really the case is not bad if you don't want them in your pocket.a little big but thats being picky.

Upon inspection, about the only negative thing I'll say is the L / R letters are printed really small... come on guys.  Do better than 3pt type for us not young guys.

I should disclose I'm an audio guy, so I know music, and know what sound should sound like.

I'll lead off with the good, since there's no real bad. Without BS, these are maybe the best <$100 BT in ear buds i've heard.  Better than Bose?  Nah, but who is?  But, for the price, these beat a wide array of other headphones I've tried and/or own myself. Many cost a lot more.

I don't like stuff in my ears, and while I don't really like these, they are tolerable for more than a few min.  I've left them in for 2 hours and still they're ok.  These look kinda cool, are comfortable, the ear loop keeps them on without even loosening.  It is just silicone so it won't conform but it fit me ok as is.  The buttons are all on the right ear, no extra piece on the wire. Main button does most everything with a rocker for vol up and down. Minor nitpick, it seems backwards to me. + vol should be forward, holding them, it looks correct, wearing them it's backwards.  A voice tells you what you did.  It dings when you're at min/max sound. Automatically quiets on phone sounds like email or text messages.. Goes off if the phone rings.

Oh but how do they sound? Wow.. Just fabulous.  With really low expectations I was shocked.  Rich, clear tone without overbearing, enough bass without adding it electronically, sharp enough without adding it, even sounds well balanced with EQ off.  IF you know who Jennifer Nettles is, she was the lead in Sugarland.  Her voice is unique and has a really distinct edge to it.  Just sounded perfect.  Leonard Cohen has a deep, raspy voice, and he sounds perfect.  Alicia Keys singing Fallin, breathtaking.  Elle King rocks.  I tried a few test tracks and they all were within optimum target ranges..  which means the sound is reproduced in the way it was supposed to sound.  Subtle sounds like an oboe don't fall off.  Music sounding like it's supposed to sound is kinda cool.

FYI.. These don't have ANC, but if you fit them correctly, it blocks out a lot of ambient noise, honestly more than the ANC headphones i didn't like much.  I have the TV on and at a moderate volume, with music playing i don't hear the tv at all .

The rest: Decent phone sounds on both sides, in-ear was pretty good, checked the phone side and also decent.

Ok, I should point out I PAID for these..  I am not being paid for this review, nor did i get these for free.  Maybe they'll send me a 2nd pair.. :)  I almost bought a different pair, but found these and figured it was worth trying them.  Glad i did.

Basically, the bottom line best $20 or double/triple that headphones you'll ever buy.  ! Really.  (Amazon don't block this review for being too good, i paid for these)

Im still wearing these, guess I have to take them off to sleep. :)

Update:  I just got back from a trip to sauna-land in Florida.  I used my new pals, my Otium Headphones, and i still love them, but one very disturbing problem was discovered.  Since the vendors read this stuff and are very concerned with these reviews, maybe they can fix it.  This isn't a deal breaker, but i feel it's enough of a problem it could change your mind.

According to my BT power app, when these headphones hit 30% power, a low battery alert started endlessly repeating ever 4-5 min.  It basically makes listening to music til they die untenable.  Out of curiosity, i ran them down with music playing and power on, i just didn't listen, and they continued to work for over 3 more hours.  They were still playing when i went to sleep, so i never really determined how much longer they lasted before the battery died. I don't think we need to know the battery is low at 30% and certainly don't need to know this every few minutes until they die . So basically, you can only use these for 70% of the decent battery life.

They need to fix this, maybe change it to battery life about 2 hours left and another at 1 hour.  after that, it just dies.. We don't really need to know they have 3+ hours left as low power every few min. ! Fix this and these will be way better than they already are, which is really good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I cannot recommend these headphones at all. On my second pair, that the customer support sent me for free, I haven't noticed any ringing sound, but there seems to be something more sinister in the back. I have felt that wearing these for longer periods puts some kind of strain in my eyes/nose area. I went back to the first pair and I could feel the same there too. I tried other wireless headsets that I have and I don't have this issue with those. Now I'm not sure this is due to bad shielding or what but this is indeed something I felt every time I wore these. I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't feel this way as I didn't see much about this in the reviews. I feel sorry for the support team as they're awesome people, but the product is too flawed to support. I'd say back to the drawing board Otium.

UPDATE #1: Without ever contacting the support, they spotted this review and were able to get back to me. Their support was quick, apologetic and understanding. They were kind enough to send a new pair of headphones and even extended the warranty to 2 years. I will update this review again once I've tested out the new headphones, but I must say that for a $20 pair of headphones, their customer support is better than most retail giants. 5* for customer support. I'll add the last star in once I've verified the new pair. Thank you OTIUM!

Beware of the issues affecting these. Was wearing mine to listen to an audiobook at night and now they have started making a ringing noise. It's subtle, in the background, but very annoying and somehow makes it uncomfortable to keep wearing for longer periods due to the persistent noise. It has only been 4+mo since I got them, so I cannot do Amazon return and cannot find otium contact for warranty. Will keep searching...

Otherwise the battery life is excellent and the build quality is what you can expect for a $20 piece. Good overall only if it wasn't for the ringing noise issue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

-Fits my ears well and stay in place. And I have weird ears and am picky about this.

CONS:
-Sometimes has issues connecting, especially if you consistently switch controlling devices.
-The ""max volume"" alert sound  is LOUD, high-pitched and painful. There is no reason for this and is a bad design

Slightly disappointed by the size, after putting them on, became instantly pleased how light, very fitting and comfortable these are. The first sound test after easily connecting, was near perfect to my ears. My hearing is still pretty good for my age so I like a headphone set that isn't high pitched at virtually any level. When I need that big sound during exercise, these have the power without leaving your eardrums tired also. They've never fallen off during walking , running or during any other intense, prolonged movement. I purposely tried to shake them off and ended up in a serious dizzy spell.(Not recommended.)  Sweat won't make them slip either. Labeled as left and right buds, for those of us that suddenly get confused.  Reception range is good too, no matter what side of your body the connected device is on. That was always an issue with previous headsets, constant connectivity during movement. One touch to answer an incoming call or just to ignore it without having to grab your phone. Built in mic also has crisp sound to it. The Otium Bluetooth headphones very much feel like they were specifically designed for my ears. I forget that I'm wearing them sometimes. Until you accidently jump in the shower with them on.

Convenient for all-purpose uses especially the use in the gym or in the car.  Good sound quality at a fair price. I have run through 5 pairs of this headphone in the last 4 years.  I kept a backup pair at any time because I lose it from time to time during traveling.  You may ask why I rate it 2 stars.  It would have been a 5 stars, if it were not that at my 4th pair, after several months use, it stops holding charges and became not usable.  Then I bought another same pair, I got the same problem.  After about three months of usage, suddenly it stops to hold charges just like the last one.  It seems their last year batch of the products are not as high quality as the old ones.
 Since this costs less than $20, spending time to call customer service about warranty amid a busy work schedule and constant deadlines is a pain.  I decide to move on to another brand of similar form of bluetooth headphone.  It seems after stick with Otum for 4 years, I am glad to see there are now more alternatives at similar or even lower price point with similar form factor, and similar or even better user reviews.

These headphones have this feature where if I turn up the volume all the way it will beep at me. It's really annoying, but that seems to be a feature on all new headphones.

They're comfortable enough to wear for a couple of hours at a time, the sound quality is good, and they've never fallen off. The battery life is also amazing, but that's part of their worst flaw: the ""battery low"" alert and the power on/power off/connected/disconnected messages. When any of these thing's happen, a recorded woman's voice announces it to you, and no matter what the volume of your ear buds or device is set to, she says it at the HIGHEST POSSIBLE VOLUME. I've learned to always turn them on and connect them BEFORE actually putting them in my ears, but every once in a while they scream BATTERY LOW and shatter my eardrums out of nowhere. It's horrid and I wish Bluetooth device manufacturers didn't do this.

But cheap.","November 8, 2017","I got these to try out the Bluetooth headphones for gym and to see if I would like that loop around the ear before purchasing a more expensive brand.
The loop is really big. I don't have small ears so I find it odd that it fits big. I don't feel like it would stop it from falling, but if its as good as a regular in-ear, I dont think it will fall off in the first place, I just find the loop pointless.
The sounds is slightly muffled. So no it doesn't have good audio quality. When I played music at a high volume, the bass seems to over power the sound and makes a crackling sound.
I got it on sale and still think my other cheap in-ear headphones (not bluetooth) work better than these.
First time pairing it to my phone took forever. After several attempts, finally it appeared on my phone's list of devices. It kept blinking and all like it said in the manual. It just wouldnt appear.
The good thing is that once you power them on again, they connect quickly and automatically to your device.

As such, I have included price point in my four star rating. Let’s be clear that had I paid 150 or 200 for these then the rating would be lower. But I didn’t pay 150 or 200, and as such let’s begin the review.

Sound
+ they have plenty of kick
+ sound quality is better than expected
- I wouldn’t say a lot of bass as much as I would say llacking mids and highs.
- Their lowest volume is a bit high (strange complaint I know but true nonetheless).

Fit
+ you can squeeze the hooks to make them a bit smaller so sort of adjustable which helps
+ Good assortment of bud sizes
+ cord is just long enough to be able to turn head etc
+ they don’t fall off, stay on during running exercising
- tend to pull away a bit as you move around but so do other more expensive pairs

Connectivity
- originally had issues with sound stuttering and unstable connection
+ followed suggestions left by company in other reviews on how to reset device and connection issues indeed went away.

Overall conclusion
More expensive pairs may sound better but the more expensive pairs all have durability issues that make me stay away from them.  These have decent sound at a fantastic price point, and for me they are a no brainer.

Overall pretty cheap though. The volume up button wore out after about a year. If you get a good seal with the earbuds it makes the bass way to much for my liking. Connectivity is great.

Update: The company sent me replacement headphones after I posted the original review. I noticed something with the new ones. The original earbuds seem to make the bass sound much better. I had lost the original on my old pair and replaced them with generic earbuds but that made them sound way to bassy. Overall I’m very happy with the new pair and the customer support.

Your phone will find the otium headset right away and you just click to pair them up. Done.

They turn themselves off after a period of no use to save battery. I always forget they're off and start playing pandora on my phone and it starts playing out my phone speaker lol.

Easy to charge, red light when charging, blue when charged.  Doesn't seem to take very long to charge and they last all day at work, 9 hours off and on.

They have volume up/down, skip, pause, and power on/off on the same headpiece all works great. You can even take calls with it. I even butt dialed someone lol. Only negative here is the volume buttons are somewhat unresponsive so I find myself clicking it twice or holding it longer which then either repeats or skips the song which isn't what I wanted to do.

It comes with three sets of earpieces and a nice zippered carry case.

Reviews on Amazon were overall positive however I wondered how they compare to other Bluetooth headphones. My coworker has the same phone I do, and she has the $140.00 beats audio headphones made by Apple. Her sound clarity 'may' be a little better, she felt like she could tell a difference.  I would hope so since she spent 7x what I did.  I wasn't sure if there was a noticeable difference but I can say the Otium headphones sound the same as the apple earbuds that came with my phone which is fine by me.  The only negative would be the Bluetooth. It's fine at my desk at work but you can't walk more than 20-30 feet away from your phone.  My friend could walk twice as far away and through a door and she said hers was still clear while the Otium clearly breaks up at 20-30 feet. These also occasionally break up at my desk and I think the pairing looses connection momentarily but then fixes itself.  For listening to pandora without a wire I'm not going to complain but it may be important to you.

For under $20 I am very pleased and don't worry about losing or breaking these lol.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sound quality on this headset is amazing. For the price, no complaints. The only real complaint, is that they do not stay in your ear when you are exercising. If you're looking for something to just casually listening to music, these would be great.

*update - love these.  They were slipping out.  I thought I needed to go down in size on the earbuds, when in fact I needed to go up a size. They did not pop out at all in my workout this morning in the sound was even better. These are a hit for the price.

I'm torn between a 2 or 3 star.  Has great sound for the price.  The problem is that they don't stay in your ears when you workout.  First time I wore them was at the gym.  Start to get that workout on and they fall out.  Several times I had to stop, towel them off and try again.  I would not recommend these for the gym.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

-lasted a while for the price
-good sound quality and keeps our external noise pretty well
-comes with different sized earbuds (my ears are small)
-had some trouble with the connecting wire going to one side and tugging, but as long as I make sure it isn’t twisted before I put the headphones in I don’t have that problem
-pairs and connects very quickly (and also tends to beat out other things I might already have connected to my phone)
-stays in well when exercising; I’ve worn it during lifts, ergs, and runs
-I’ve seen some reviews that express dissatisfaction with the range, but I’ve been happy with mine. It gets a little iffy around the end of the advertised range especially if there are solid objects in the way, but otherwise I’m very satisfied with the range

Cons:
-I bought this in October 2018, it’s now August 2019 and they suddenly aren’t charging properly anymore. I know it’s not the cable or the charging port as they both work with other things, the charging light just doesn’t turn on/takes a long time to turn on so I feel like they’re not charging. Don’t know if this might be because of sweat in the headphone charging port?
-has decent battery life but only warns you of low battery when it’s literally almost dead, and it does so extremely loudly
-I sweat a lot, and sometimes sweat goes into my ear and makes the earbud extremely uncomfortable. Overall moisture wicking works pretty well though","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Anyway, they're great headphones. Comfortable, amazing sound quality for media, and the adjustable volume separate from my phone and computer's sound is great for me. I love them! They're great for media, but the call quality leaves a lot to be desired. My girlfriend, who I talk to on Skype, says the mic quality isn't great but it's not terrible. I'm still trying to figure out if my problem is with Skype or with the headphones, though. As soon as I know, I'll definitely update!

Function as intended, found no issues. Holding the button to turn it on or off or just changing the song works without any concerns. It doesn't completely cancel noise so it's good for those who want some environmental awareness. When the volume goes to high, it will inform the user of the risks of hearing noises loudly. This can get annoying as you need to press okay on the notification to increase the volume. Once if reaches the highest volume, it will beep loudly which really hurts and its annoying.

At first, I was a little worry about the sound quality, but after tested it for several days, I have to say the sound quality is definitely better than I have expected (music is loud and crispy clear)

In addition, I really like it has physical button to control everything.  Compared with Air pod, which you have to control everything mainly through Siri (it can be painful sometimes when Siri does not respond correctly), I can basically control everything with few clicks of buttons.

Other advantages I like about this earphone are the fast Bluetooth connectivity to iPhone, and its water proof capability.  I can connect earphone to my IPhone in just a few seconds (faster than air pod), and it has water proof capability to fight against sweat and suitable for any sport exercise.

For the battery, it can last around 5-6 hours.  I usually charge the headphone 1-2 times a week.
For the price it worth ($20), I highly recommend this headphone to anyone who is looking for  a decent sport earphone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The bass is very clear, and it helps block out environmental noise. The waterproofing is great, I don't have to worry about sweat or rain at all. These are my first wireless headphones, so I can only compare them to wired headphones. Not having to worry about wires when working out is very convenient. When you need to take off one or both headphones, the cord clip lets you dangle the headphone off your neck and shoulders.

I have been using these headphones for a couple of months by now. About a week ago, one of the outer covers for one of the head buds got disconnected. I contacted the seller and they were able to fix the problem right away. While the headphones are solidly built, they are not indestructible. If you need to keep them in a backpack or pant pockets, use the protective case that they send you!

Pros:
Great clear sound
Waterproofing
The cord clip
Carrying case
Customer service

Cons:
Battery warning (other reviews may comment about it)
Needing to be charged (vs wired headphones)

Overall it is a great deal for what you pay for it.

Recently, the one that I have been using suddenly dead. So I purchased one from Amazon based on the product reviews. It worked but the control button and battery section dangling on the right side ear bud was too heavy and when I run or move the right earbud pulled out to the point that I cannot really enjoy my workout. So I purchased this one with the extra supporting hook. Also there is nothing on the cable between earbuds. I had this for about a week and tried 3 times during my workout and I am very happy with it. It stays where it should be. Battery last long and the batter hold time is superb. One thing I do not like about it is that it sound kind of muffled with the high frequency side deteriorated.

I am blown away.  I am by no means an audiophile but I have tried many versions of ear buds.  I have owned several Sure, ME, Jabar, and Bose. Some wired as some wireless.  I have to say these Otium are impressive.  Plenty of bass.  Mid range and vocals are clear.  I don't hear the highs as clearly as I use too but do not detect any defects in these earbuds.  Additionally, the microphone is great.  I took several calls, while working, and asked all callers if they had any problem hearing me and none had any issues.  My wife said she actually thought they sounded better than the mic on my Motorola Android phone.  The advertised ""noise canceling"" is a bit confusing.  I don't  think they can be called ""noise canceling"".  With the proper ear tips they do ""block noise"" effectively.  ""Canceling"" to me implies ""electronic cancelation"".  These do not do that.  Regardless, for the money, and maybe 3 times the money, these are great earbuds.  One more point, they are not small.  I ride motorcycles and there is no way you could fit these in a full face helmet.  Just so you know.  That aside, for work or while excersizing these are great Bluetooth earbuds.  You will not go wrong buying them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The life of my Plantronics Backbeat Go headphones came to an end, and I was super spoiled with the great bass they provided. So, when they stopped working, I was mega bummed because I didn't want to spend a lot on another pair.

I recently ordered an un-related generic pair from here on Amazon, but those had horrible bass and the Bluetooth reception was weak. Had to return those quick.

I will venture to say these Otium as just as good as the Plantronics I replaced, but the Plantronics cost me $100 at the time. Obviously, great value for these Otiums. It's very convenient that these Otiums have hooks to go around the ears, because when I am lifting a lot of weight in the gym I don't have to worry about them slipping out of my ears if there is too much blood pressure going to my head, as was the case with my Plantronics which had no ear hooks.

Nonetheless, it's a great product when it worked.

Update: Otium has been in communication with me regarding my issues with the above. They were very nice and sent me a replacement pair with all the accessories included. I tested the new pair as I did the previous one and didn't encounter the same issue under the same conditions. But, I do experience some interference when I am at the gym. I try to replicate the interference in the same spot at the gym, different day, but the issue seems to come and go in random locations within the same gym.  Otium let me know that this may be interference with wifi.

Other than the random glitches above, the battery lasts a very long time, I charge it maybe once or twice a week. Audio and style are very good, and Otium customer service is exceptional.

First, the spoken ""battery low"" notification startles me every time. The volume of the notification is noticably louder than whatever I'm listening to, even at the lowest volume setting.

Second, the battery level readings don't seem accurate at all. It seems to be at 70% most of the time, then suddenly drains to 30%, giving me the loud ""battery low"" notification, then a few minutes later the headphones are completely out of battery. I have no problem with the battery life itself, I just never have any idea of when I need to charge, until I get the notification which gives me maybe 15 minutes until the battery is completely dead.

Another thing I've had an issue with is that the headphones seem to get turned on really easily when I'm not using them, and as far as I can tell, they don't automatically shut off. To be fair, if I stored them in the case instead of just throwing them in my bag, they probably wouldn't get accidentally turned on so often.

2. I have small ears, and the smallest of the three included silicone bud sizes actually fit in my ear reasonably well (during workouts they sometimes fall out, but between the over-the-ear piece and the plastic (vinyl?) connecting neck string -- it's unlikely to lose them).
3. The sound quality is quite good. And the microphone works perfectly! I was able to take a phone call without interrupting a workout, and my caller was surprised at how normal my voice and call quality sounded (until I started breathing hard, he had no clue I was on a headset and working out. Lol.). For music, they lack the bass and richness of high-end alternatives, but really the quality has no major flaws to my ear.

These were an impulse purchase while ordering a few other things, and really glad I got them!

UPDATE after 1+ month of heavy use: My one annoyance is inability to use these while they're charging. But since I'm getting around 6-hours usage from a full charge, can't complain too much.

And a really minor IMHO design flaw is that the vinyl/plastic cord attaching these to each other comes out the front of the buds, e.g. towards your face, to fall naturally in front of your throat, rather than from behind to fall more naturally at back of neck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

McKenzie","Great headphones for the price","February 4, 2019","I’m a pretty active fellow, some would say. I also enjoy listening to music while I do things and stuff. And this is why I needed Bluetooth headphones.

In the kitchen: I love cooking and listening to music with earbuds. And I have a good sized kitchen so I’m always going back and forth, opening and shutting drawers and cabinets. Then whammy!! The dang cords get wrapped around a handle and my buds pop out of my ears and dangle on the floor. Bummer.

Running: not so much fun having little cords whip my face with every step.

Shopping: yes, I’m one of those people who listen to music while shopping. I keep my phone in the cart with the list facing me but when I reach out further than the earbud cord goes, buds pop out or phone drops into the cart.

There it is. My life with corded ear buds. So why don’t I just get AirPods? Because I don’t want to fork over $160 for something I’m gonna lose. Instead I opted for the Otium wireless buds.

The cost is great. Not too expensive. They come in a round case with a variety of ear pads for different sized ears and a charging micro usb cord which is a bit ridiculously short.

The ear pads were a bit large for my large ears. I mean, really? I have, I guess, normal sized man ears, but a quick change to a slightly smaller size and the buds fit perfectly in my head holes.

After a quick charge I put them to good use. First off, pairing with my phone was quick and easy. After a read of the instructions, navigating the buttons on the right bud was pretty intuitive. The fit snugly in my head without feeling like something is tugging at me at all times. And the connection cord around my neck is negligible. All in all a good fit and very comfortable.

So what about sound? Not bad. With the larger ear pads everything sounded like it was solely treble, but when I got the right size and the buds fit normally I could finally hear some bass. Not much. But enough to make a difference.

The overall quality of sound is equivalent to the iPhone ear buds, sans the bass. I kept my phone either in my pocket or in my arm band and the sound never scratched or skipped a beat. Not sure how far I can go before the Bluetooth connection disrupts, but if you’re like me, your phone will be nearby at all times anyway.

I have an eclectic taste in music. I listen to everything from classical, to 80s rock or pop, rap, film scores, alternative, and more. I’m not expecting to hear the quality of a live orchestra, but for all intents and purposes these are a great pair of headphones.

I give this product four stars for overall quality of sound, function, design, etc. Four stars means if I need to replace them in the future, I may look for another product, but I’ll more than likely stick with these again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I've been using a set of old Sony over the ear headphones for years.  My kid is 12...had them since before he was born.  So to say I have attachment issues is an understatement!  So I broke down and finally joined the new age.  I felt dirty at first to be honest.  Like I was cheating on my old Sonys.  But boy do I love these!  The battery life is pretty great.  I've connected these to my iPhone and my LG with no issues.  I sometimes layer up when working out.  So I put my phone in the pockets of my hoodies or sweat pants and these done miss a beat.  The range is really good as well for bluetooth.  For my rather large head they are really comfortable and stay in place.  When I do squats, clean and jerks and dead lifts the headphones dont move.  I had to change out the little ear buds to a larger size but that's okay it comes with the headphones!  I'm so use to having to move a cable out of the way for pushups or dips but with these its a breeze.  I cant speak about wearing these while jogging.  Quit frankly...I...don't...run!  So if your on the fence about these...just go ahead and jump off and buy!

At the time, they would not power on, charge, connect, etc. I was pretty disappointed at first because I took care of them, kept them in the case and only charged when the battery was low. After posting my experience/rating Otium reached out to me. They offered to replace or refund the headphones with no hassles. I loved them so I requested a replacement and they shipped them to me that same day. The headphones may have had an issue, but things happen, but there customer service did a great job correcting the situation. So I’m confident that they stand behind their products & take care of their customers.

As far as the headphones, I like is the comfort around the ears and ease of use. The sound quality and the noise cancellation were good, They also worked good for running, but when I start sweating they sometimes slid out of position/ears & I have to reposition. Overall, these are a good buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I wasnt expecting much for the price but they can with extra ear tips and a nices csrbon fiber like case. The material of the earbuds is this softplastic type which makes them fine to have in you ears for a couple of hours. Sound is fine, i didnt expect much for the price and they do the job, not much to complain about there. The biggest con i found was, at least for my pair, the battery life was horrible, for the same price is bought wirless earbuds and some headphones that least way longer.

I literally have a drawer full of earbud Bluetooth headphones.  Some mediocre and others not so bad.  They all have one thing in common...they don't stay in my ears.  These simply do.  They are incredibly comfortable and stay put, but not only do they stay put but they stay snug in my ear keeping the bass pumping.  They are very easy to pair, easy to operate and feel solid and well made.  Many compare them to Beats in appearance and performance.  I have not tried Beats so I can't comment on performance comparisons.  I can, however, comment on the performance of these.

1.  Battery life is incredible.  The battery easily lasts all day.  Time to charge is about average.

2.  Bluetooth pairs easily and connects to both my Samsung S8+ and my iPhone 6S+ quickly.  The female voice that comfirms connection is fluid and natural not robotic or stuttering.  Bluetooth range is the best of any bluetooth headphone I've tried.  Outside it is easily exceeds the advertised 30'.  Inside the range will follow me from room to room.  it's not until I am almost across the house from the phone that I experience drops.  Otherwise, I have not experienced any drops, lag, or static.

3.  Sound is more than acceptable.  On the Samsung I have the capability of tailoring the sound with EQ settings that I don't have on the iPhone.  Despite this both phones provide solid bass and good highs.  For some midrange might be a little muddy.  But, that's also going to largely depend on how the source music your're listening to is mastered. These are not going to dethrone the Sennhiesers I have but they are quite capable headphones.  I hear nuances of a recording I miss with other earbuds.  I was not dissappointed with the sound of these earbuds.  Quite the contrary, I was pleasantly surprised.

Now let's be honest.  These are $20 earbuds.  While they perform as good or better than advertised if you really wanted audiophile quality you probably wouldn't be here.  But, the days of audiophile quality music has sadly suffered greatly in this day of mp3 compressed recordings with further compression from Bluetooth reducing music quality even further.  These earbuds will not disappoint with fit or sound making them a..err...sound investment.  Not to mention, $200 Beats are just as easy to break or lose as these $20 Otiums.  So tell me, which one will cause you to cry aligator tears if that happens?","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have Beats Wireless 3 headphones as well, but wanted to venture out and see how a cheaper priced pair would compare to Beats. Well overall I am satisfied, these headphones seem durable; granted I have not taken them to the gym yet. A couple things that I wish were improved upon are the over the ear stabilizers (if that is what they are called); in my opinion they seem flimsy/too flexible, so I am not sure until this afternoon how they will perform at the gym. It would also be nice if Optium would include a excess wire keeper like Beats or Jaybird. Sound quality is decent, the pair I received I needed me to tweak the Treble settings a bit, and also certain Bass frequencies tend to make the sound fizzle (not sure how to actually term it) The things I do like so far are: inexpensive price, larger power button (compared to Beats) and that these include a silicone plug to the USB charging port. My biggest complaint with Beats Wireless 3's is that after extensive exercise they will turn off on me, and I will need them to dry out for almost a week.  I tend to believe that may be the culprit to the battery issue. Lastly the carrying case is nice, the USB charging cable and different size ear pieces are included.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Took it to the gym, ran, sweat, jump roped. And all was fine. I will admit that the wire connecting the earbuds  did swing on one side while working out ,which could of been fix by using the black tie that it came with. But I didn't bother to.

 You do get different earbuds size and even one that seem to do more of noise canceling. It's one of those spong like piece.

The battery life on these is beautiful:'). I would be on 1 hr bus ride to school,work out for like 2:30hr and still have some for the day and the way back home. When you run it may feel like it's slipping out but the ear hook those a good job in holding it in place and my ears are kind of small.

The buds fit in nicely and cancel out some noise (there are also extra earbuds of different sizes that come with the packaging; very convenient). The sound quality is good/clear for the price. The small circular container (4"" diameter) that comes with the headphones looks good. Bluetooth pairing and charging are very simple to perform (takes 1.5-2 hrs to charge fully).
The cons are the big size of the headphones and the lack of wire length adjusting. I didn't realize how awkward the size of the headphones are, especially when you notice that many people nowadays have tiny bluetooth earbuds that are sleek and less prominent to the eye. These headphones look like unnecessary blocks outside your ears. No adjustments to the wire length is not that bad but it would have been preferable to have something to change up the length.
(*Note that both of these cons are pretty subjective and have slightly dampened my experience but may not matter to you.*)

- Sound: The sound is clear, I can feel the bass, and I can hear them clearly over gym music or while on my motorcycle (they barely fit under a standard full-face helmet).
- Connection: Never had any serious issues. Every now and then the sound will skip when the battery is low. Worst cases were on a rainy 5 mile run and on my motorcycle, both cases are understandable. The range goes out to about 15 meters before cutting out a little.
- Battery: I use them for about 2 hours a day and they last me all week before I need to charge them. There isnt much warning when they're about to die though. Also, they do not turn off on their own, if you forget to shut them down, they'll drain the battery.
- Calls: the mic doesnt seem to pick up audio well during phone calls, but works in a pinch.

Here's some of the positives

Cheap ($39.99) but pretty good sound (for me at least).
They fit very well and are very easy to operate.
They live up to their IPX8 rating (I shower with them every day).
The battery life is good (3-4 hours) being able to charge them in their case in a couple hours is great when I'm on the go.
The ""Multifunction Button"" (MFB) took some getting used to but is pretty straightforward and intuitive.
I use an Android phone (Note 8) and usually use one headphone at a time and I haven't had any pairing problems at all even when swapping between the left and right earpieces.

The ONLY negative I have with these is that the volume can NOT be adjusted from the headphones although in thinking about it I'm not sure how that would be accomplished while using only one at a time. So I suffer with the first world problem of having to adjust the volume with my phone instead.

Despite the quite-cheap price and light weight, they feel substantial, nothing cheap and easy to break... the rubber and plastic is all good quality, the design is nice and feels more, erm, ""expensive"", than the price would indicate.

 The sound is loud and clean, arguably better (or at least louder/crisper) than some pricier bluetooth headphones I've tried..I've never had problems connecting / disconnecting. The battery lasts a reasonable amount of time for the price (not expecting 15 hour battery life from $20 bluetooth headphones).

Minor issues:
The ear pieces do stick out a fair bit, so maybe not the best if you wear snug caps or hats. Not a problem, just part of the design, but something to keep in mind in case it's winter time and trying to get these under tight snowcaps or something.

The bluetooth battery indicator on-screen will go from 70-80% down to battery warning, to dead within a few mins. Not a huge deal because the battery lasts an OK amount of time and is quick to charge.

The track /phone controls take some getting used to. They're definitely not the same as on other devices, for instance track advance/rewindis done using volume buttons not play button.  Overall though, I'm happy with the button placement/setup, and it's nice not having a cheap plastic volume control stuck on the wire itself.

Given those extremely minor issues and the cheap price, I've stuck with these and have now bought 3 pairs in a row (Due to losing 1 pair and carelessly damaging another).  I just tried to upgrade to slightly pricier paid ($70-80) by another company, and am already tempted to return to these since they just feel and sound better to me.

The sound quality is great; they don't move when you're running/jumping and the battery life is pretty good. I use the headphones for 1-2 hours 4-5x/week and I think I charge them maybe once/week.

I have a new set of AirPods. These cost ten times less than the Apple product, guess what .. you would think you paid 75-100 for these! Connection is brilliant, the ease of putting them in ear and the comfort level blows the competition out of the water. Great simplicity in the buttons, they take phone calls easily, redial, and auto connect back to music after the call.
The sound quality is great ( relative to price) sure the bass could be tighter, it’s a tad muddy at times ( listening to hi-res) recordings. Vocals are great! Volume is definitely sufficient. Did I say they are super comfy?  These are a no brainer at this price as a primary listener or a fantastic second set that you don’t mind losing or destroying ($15 bucks) I’m keeping them as my workout set and beach wear.

It’s more replicating the design of beats wireless headphones for cheaper price.  Build quality is good.  Comes with a carrying hard shell case with zipper which is added bonus that I didn’t expect for the price paid.  Paired quick to both iOS and android devices and the connection was quick.  Sound quality is good.  Works good and was able to listen for good 6 hours.  I didn’t get a chance to test at a stretch but it’s turns off to sleep mode after a period of no usage which is good for battery.  There is fewer buttons and attractive sports design.

I was disappointed in the Otium as they sounded underwhelming, there's no fullness, and just sounds lacking in general. The fit isn't that great either, but that may depend on the person's ear. They don't feel secure even with the hooks. The Soundpeats wingtips feel much more secure, and I never worry about them falling out during exercise. I do like that the Otium are waterproof. One thing that really bothers me is the bottom volume button is for volume + and the top volume button is for -. I frequently turn down the volume, or go to the previous track when I meant to do the opposite.

The headset is very light weight and I hardly noticed I was wearing them after a few minutes. The sound quality is surprisingly good playing back clear high frequency and speech as well as decent quality low frequency at about the halfway volume. They do go rather loud, but this does start to affect the sound quality and adds some distortion.

The headset paired with ease to my Pixel XL and Samsung S7 and I am able to switch between the two devices without having to disable or reconnect the headset or Bluetooth on the phones. If you receive an incoming while listening to music on your phone the music is paused and you get a notification played back for the incoming call as well as the calling number being read back to you. I also connected the headset to my laptop and was able to use it for music as well as the audio device and microphone when making calls from the Skype for Business client.

The Bluetooth range on these are not the best, the booklet says 10 meters, which I guess if fine if you are using it with your mobile phone which would usually be in your pocket or close by. They claim to be waterproof and good for use in the rain or shower, I tend to not take my phone into the shower… so I'll see if I get to test this at some stage.

Overall I am very impressed with this headset, they have a very nice feel to them and the build quality seems very good. I'll need to see if the battery holds up to the 8 hours claimed in the included booklet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have had this for only two days so my review is not about how it holds up to abuse over time.  Just a PRO/CON List.
Overall great little Blue Tooth headset for only $20 at Amazon.

PRO
1. It's $20 at Amazon Great Price
2. Blue Tooth has a good range (unless you area wearing tight pants then somehow connection is bad - See Comments below for explanation)
3. Sound is very decent compared to products that cost five times more
4. Sports?  Yes.  I've used them for running, Aerobics, Weight Lifting and just walking around.  The Headsets never fell or felt like they were going to fall
5. Battery Life is great (8 Hours)
6. Very comfortable to wear (no issues for me).
7 . NO WIRES!!! (sorta).

CON
1. The headsets stick out a bit.  This can be a problem if you wear a hoodie or a hood while raining (See Comments for more).
2. Trying to connect to a device is not the most intuitive process (read comments below) and can be a bit frustrating
3. The tail can get in your way and that can cause you to feel it pulls as you move your head left/right.
4. It can only be paired with one device at a time (not sure if this is a real problem since it's not for me).

Comments
PRO 2  - Bluetooth range is pretty amazing.  I can have a device 30 feet away and still get great audio (thru at least one wall).  Unless somehow you have tight pants.  I use Tight running pants when I run in the Winter.  Putting the Source in my pants pocket caused the signal to break up somehow.  I don't know if this is because of my device or the headset.

While wearing loose fitting pants (sweats) I had no issues.  As mentioned I left my MP3 player in another room and walked to the front door of my house and continued to get great sound.

CON 1 - Headsets stick out a bit.  I wear a hood when running (especially when it rains) and because the headsets stick out a bit they rub against the hood.  The rubbing of the headsets against the hoodie of my jacket causes the noise to be transferred to the headset and you can hear it.  It's not loud enough to not let you hear the music but if this is something that bothers you then get a more expensive product.

CON 2 - Blue Tooth Connection - Trying to connect to a device the first time can be a bit frustrating. All I can say is don't do like me and read the instructions.  The Device turns on by pressing the button for 3 seconds and it only connects when the device is off and press the button for 8 Seconds.  Except the device doesn't tell you it is in pairing mode with audio or when it connects.  The only way to know is to look at the little LED red/blue blinking light (which indicates it's in pairing mode) and when it goes blue it is paired.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

This is such a huge improvement over the hard/stationary ear hooks that’s typical for these cars of ear phones. The soft and flexible nature of the hooks make putting them on much easier, and removing the earphones is quick and doesn’t hurt my ear like the hard ear hooks of other models.

Sound quality is great and on-par with other IEMs. Much of the sound quality and sound isolation comes from making sure you have a snug fit with the silicone tips in your ears. These come with multiple sizes of tips so you shouldn’t have an issue finding the right size.

I love that the wire is the ‘non-tangle’ kind. The smooth and wide shape of the wire really helps against tangling and can be extended to full length very easily. An absolute boon to ear phones that still use a wire.

The one real complaint I have is with the UX layout of the buttons. When you put these ear phones on, the (-) volume button is facing forward and the (+) is facing backwards. In other words, when being worn, the (-) button is essentially ABOVE the (+) button. This may not be an issue for some people, but for me, it’s extremely unintuitive; Because the volume buttons are essentially ‘flipped’ when being worn, I end up raising the volume instead of lowering the volume and vice versa. Considering that in order to Skip and Backtrack songs are controlled via the volume buttons, this also becomes an issue.

One other issue I have is with the main button. Sometimes, it just doesn’t register my input when I want to stop/start my music. After a few tries, it will start registering again.

Overall, for the price, these are really good Bluetooth IEMs. Sounds quality is great along with the noise reduction, and the non-tangle wire is very convenient. The flexible ear hooks are a real nice touch. The only things that really annoyed me were the unintuitive layout of the volume buttons and the occasional fickleness of the pause/play button.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The sound is great and i used them at least 5 days a week. I like drowning out wverything around me when i have them in and they work great for that. The battery life is average for wireless bluetooth. They seem to last about 6 hours if you are listening to music but if youre using them to stream a tv show or something,  for some reason they last a little longer. Maybe 8 hours? I loved the fact that they announced the phone number of the incoming caller, not just ring or say incoming call.  I loved them until about 2 weeks ago when one of the ears started experiencing a short. So now only 1 side works.  Ive only had them about 6 months. I had to go out and buy some garbage ones from Walmart for the same price i paid for these but dont work nearly as well. Im on a hunt for some that will have the same, if not better sound quality but will also last longer than 6 months.

*Update* After writing the review Otium contacted me and offered me a replacement pair. I was very happy to know that they back their products. The process to get a new pair did not take long at all. The offer came with a replacement of the exact headphones that i had before or i could choose from two others. I did opt for the same ones since i loved them so much.

Connecting the headphones to the Apple Watch (or any Bluetooth device) is relatively easy after reading the short instructions in the manual. Power control (on/off) and volume control are relatively simple as well. However, the location of the power on/off button is not in the greatest spot; I accidentally push on it when putting the headphones on my ear. (Now that I know, it doesn’t happen anymore as I handle them differently). The headphones did not feel 100% secure when I put them on my ears for the first time, but this was not the case practically. They were very secure at the gym, and did not slip off or move on my ear at any time. I would have given a 4 or 5 star if it wasn’t for the sound quality. It sounds just ok; maybe a 6 out of 10. The base is relatively low, and the overall music is not the best quality. This MIGHT be an Apple Watch issue, I don’t know. I spend about 1.5 hours at a time at the gym. They never came close to running out of power since I charged it fully. And connection was never lost. They come with a small secure case, extra ear buds, a charger, and instruction manual. Overall I do like the headphones especially for the price. I might search around to test other Bluetooth headphones in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

After connecting the headphones with my device, I turned up the sound all the way so that I was able to hear the music without actually putting the headphones in my ears.

Horst","Great Headset for People on the Move!","February 2, 2019","I usually prefer over-the-ear headsets but after getting myself the M9’s a while back, I’ve really come to like the Otium brand!  This time around, my wife wanted a pair to use when watching movies on her phone and going for walks around the neighborhood.  Therefore, we thought we would try these since, lets face it, the price is awesome, they had an over-the-ear clip to help keep them secure, and my experience with the M9’s has been so good!

Pros:

First off, out of the box, these are very nice looking!  It feels well made (especially considering the price!) and comes with a wide assortment of ear pieces and accessories.  To top it off, it has a case to keep everything in.  While I didn’t care for the shiny case (I like the matte look of my M9’s), my wife really likes it!

Paring the headset was extremely easy and the connection is very reliable.  The in-ear prompts strike a  perfect balance between being intuitive and helpful without being annoying (a big deal in my opinion!).

While, I prefer the sound of my M9’s (better base IMO), my wife absolutely loves these!  Crisp high’s make the dialog easy-to understand in her movies and the balanced mix makes them great for music as well.  She couldn’t believe how much better sounding these were than any other headset she’s used in the past!

While there isn’t active noise-cancelation, it still does a good job blocking out the ambient noise thanks to it’s in-ear design.  Also, thanks to the over-the-ear clip, it has been very secure for her walks.

Cons:

The only complaint she had is that, like me, she has small ears so the smallest ear piece is still a little too large for her.  (I think the M9’s are a little smaller so I didn’t have that problem.)

Either way, I would highly recommend this set if you’re looking for an over-the-ear Bluetooth headset.  If you don’t need the over-the-ear piece though and have smaller ears, I would highly recommend you check out the Otium M9’s as well!  Either way, it’s definitely another winner from Otium!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are basically cheaper knock-offs of Beats, and I would gladly pick these over Beats any day. The only issue is that, like Beats, they are focused mainly on helping your ears feel the beats by heavily strengthening the bass. The mid range is decent, and the high range is tolerable, but I would not really want to listen to these for too long. I will say, though, that by changing your EQ to Treble Booster these headphones sound much much better.

In terms of the Bluetooth connectivity these are simply, very easy to use, and are super easy to fit on your ear.

Just bought a second pair when I lost the first pair. But guess what - they cost 20$, so losing one isn't an issue! Which is why I love these headphones.
- Sound quality is fine, all ranges are great (only a true audiophile would find issue).
- Super comfortable - the key is that the wires extend out of the headphone, not the thing that goes over your ears.
- Have compared to the real Beats these are based on. Of course, the $250 headphones are made of higher quality rubber materials, etc. (as they should be for such a ripoff)... but sound and comfort difference is minimal - while these come at <10% of the cost!!!
- Battery life in my first pair was fantastic. Lasted 9 am to 6 pm continuous listening for 3 months before I lost them, no problem!

TL:DR: Dr. Dre has enough money, and if you're reading this you probably don't have as much as him. Don't give all your money to him.

Loud, very you will not complain about that. Durable very tough, very hard to break. Last time I bought they were $25 and worth every penny, that's why I continue to buy them if I lose them lol. I personally think these are the best Bluetooth headphones you can get for the price. I never leave the house without them. They charge insanely quick, listen all dsay with only a 20-30 min charge to fill em back up again. Best headphones I've bought. Will never go to another product.

I bought my first pair in January and had them for about 8 months before I lost them, (Whoops).

But, during the time I had/used them. They were amazing especially for the price.

The sound quality was nice, it wasn't the best nor the worst. But for the price you can't complain. It was definitely decent enough that I won't complain.

Noise cancellation: Very good. While at work I only use one of them so I can make sure I can hear people if they need me :P

Battery life is good, A solid 8 hours run time, with an hour or two to charge back up.

Some points:
*I've warn these in the rain without a problem.

*Even running or moving around while working. These haven't fallen completely off because of the band that loops around your ear.

* Easy to use controls, even while wearing gloves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I do not know how I did not discover these wireless earphones sooner. Background: I have used BeatsX by Dr. Dre. These were good wireless earphones, bass was good, sound okay. Guess what, broke within 1 year and warranty ran out. I have used Jaybird x3. These were definitely one of my favorites. Broke in 1.5 years due to not holding a charge. Warranty was only for one year. So I have spent around $130 each on these wireless earphones just to have them break and not be covered by warranty.

I figured, why not just try a cheap wireless earphone from Amazon since all wireless earphones break within a year or two anyways. I saw Otium bluetooth earphones and purchased these due to the good reviews and mainly because it was $20. This is my first day using it, so I can not review it for the longevity, however I can tell you that the sound is on par with the BeatsX and Jaybird x3. However, the Beats and Jaybirds did have better bass, but it didn't really matter to me. I workout 5 days a week, so I needed something I can just listen music to without any wires. Surprisingly these can go double the distance of my Jaybird x3s without losing connection. That is what prompted me to write this review.

In conclusion, you get double the distance of connection, on par music sound, all for 1/6 of the price of more well known wireless earphones. Even if it breaks, you get 1.5 year of warranty, or just even spend $20 each time it breaks. It will be well worth it even if these last 1-2 years.

Do they need to be pushed back in your ear every now & then?  Yeah, but they never go far & it is such an easy thing to do that I cannot understand anybody complaining about fit.  Does the sound compare to over the ear (Beats), I wouldn't know but I wouldn't expect them to at less than 1/10 the cost!

They stopped working.  After some research on Amazon, reading reviews I decided to purchase these.  I've had them about 2 months.  They work great, the sound quality is decent.  The fit and finish aren't quite as nice as the Beats but for $20, it's great!  I'm only using them for 45-50 minutes at a time and then re-charging them.  Sometimes I forget to re-charge them and use them again the next day.  Haven't run out of battery yet.

I've literally bought 5-6 pairs since my (3rd, mind you) Beats broke. I sweat like a mofo during the gym (45 minutes on the stairmaster will do that) therefore every single pair of bluetooth headset I've ever bought has broken down in no time flat. I can't replace the Beats that easily, so I've been buying cheaper ones, since I can afford to break those. It's not them, it's me.

To my surprise, this pair has lasted me three! THREE! months so far. Knock on wood and all, but yeah, these are pretty good. They act up sometimes though. It takes like 10 seconds to connect (sometimes) after I turn them on. They sound choppy (sometimes) initially. The volume is (sometimes) really, really low and then I have to reboot them. Sometimes the range is like 15 feet, then today I had to run across the gym a couple hundred feet and I could hear my music. Also, the ear pieces really suck. They make the sound get muffled when there's water in my ear. Easily rectified when I switch them out with another random earpiece.

I LOVE These Wireless Headphones!","January 29, 2018","Absolutely stellar sound reproduction from these.

I was throughly impressed.

I've tried a few brands of wireless Bluetooth headphones in the past, and wasn't too impressed. They either sound somewhere between horrible and meh or sound great but don't hold a charge well. As a result, I've pretty much sworn off Bluetooth headphones and stuck with wired ones from Bose, Audio Technica and Beats.

Granted, I've only owned Android devices, so I haven't had the pleasure of testing out Apple's own wireless headphones. So there's that.

By FAAAAAARRRRR, these are probably the best earbuds I've ever worn, including wired ones.

I listen to mostly Hip Hop music, and generally only the Boom Bap kind. For those who are unaware of what that means, it basically means rap music that usually places more emphasis on deep sounds, layers upon layers of melody, intricate sampling and lots of 808 goodness. It's basically  NOT what gets played on the radio nowadays.

Yeah, I'm that ""get off my lawn!"" type of Hip Hop purist. An unapologetic Boom Baptist, if you will lol

Having typed all that, something from old, soulful Kanye or The Alchemist or No I.D. or Nottz Raw or J Dilla or The RZA or DJ Static or DJ K-Def or The Neptunes or illmind or Brock Berrington or Flamingosis or DJ Premier sounds IMPOSSIBLY GOOD on these.

I know because I listened to music from all of them on these earbuds! Lol

Operation is simple, there's almost no distortion at high volumes, pairing is damn near instantaneous after the first time you set it up (no, seriously...as soon as I turned them on, they connected), and they hold a charge for a very, very long time. Far longer than any other set of Bluetooth headphones I've ever used.

Again, I've not tested the ones from Apple, which are allegedly nigh perfect. And also way more expensive than these.

But for the price I paid ($20), these are a virtual steal.

I am currently going through a search for the perfect bluetooth headset for working out and this may be it.
----What I love----
-It securely stays in my ear without having to shove it into my ear canal. Running, jumping. It stayed while working out and I can barely feel it while wearing it.
-3 different size of ear suctions thingies
-The hard case is actually helpful. It has a pocket, so you can actually use it for more than storing your headset. Also a hook that makes it easy to place on your purse or backpack.
-Setting up the bluetooth was super easy. Isn't it usually? Not always with this off brand things. I did not have to look for a weird number/letter name that had nothing to do with the product. It simply showed up as ""Otium"" and I knew that was it.
-It came already charged, so I was able to try it out right away.
-Extended warranty: This is a new one for me. It came with a little card when you can register for free for an extended 9 month warranty. I did not buy the square trade so I did register it. First time I see this option from an off brand bluetooth headset.
-Sound: It's great for me, it has volume buttons on the actual headset. I am not interested in bass and super strong sound, so I cannot speak further than this. Sound is very clear for music and movies.
---Suggestions---
None really. I am a little worried about the over the ear hook and hoping it does not break if bended. It does not come off and on, so if it comes off, it's OFF. Will update if it breaks.

Overall, it is a great option. No need to buy $90 beats headphones. This are just as great for me and my wallet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Sound quality so far is amazing I don’t have any issues or any weird feedback. I only use this to listen to music not for phone calls so I can’t comment on the microphone or the sound quality during calls but they work perfect for what I use them for. THE RANGE IS AMAZING! I can go up and down the stairs in my home without any interruption without needing to bring my phone with me so far I have been able to go outside and leave my phone in the house, the headphones did go out after about 12feet which was surprising to me and very impressive.

I’ve used them nearly every day, in a whole slew of different scenarios, and they’re holding up very well! I have worn them in the rain, while doing yard work, while riding in a car, while exorcising, and while pressure washing. The sound quality doesn’t seem to have diminished at all, so they seem pretty waterproof!

That being said I do have a few complaints. When they were delivered, I don’t think they had a manual, so I haven’t figured out how to change songs using just the headphones or anything yet. Also, if you want to just have them in one ear, the other one tends to be so heavy that it drags the one in use out of your ear, so I’d recommend “clipping” the unused one to your collar. Sometimes while using them, they kind of move and come out of your ear a little, which is extremely annoying. There are a few options for changing the tips, but not enough that they’d fit everyone’s ears. And last but not least, the battery life leads a little to be desired. It feels like in ~4 hours of use, it tells you your headphones are on low battery. And the voice that tells you is pretty loud and annoying.

Other than that though I have no complaints. They’re certainly fantastic for the price and even knowing my complaints I’d still buy them again, and recommend them to anyone looking for affordable Bluetooth headphones!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I really like the clarity of the sound and the mic works very well. I can only set the volume on the phone to about 1/3 of the max volume before it gets too loud. The battery life so far is about 8hrs of continuous use.  I do have a couple of suggestions for the mfr. When you reach max volume on the earphones you get a loud screech, a voice would be better. The cord gets stuck on the back of my neck and I have to lift it off to turn my head sometimes. A little longer cord would be nice. The last thing is it would be nice if it told you how many hours of play time you have when you turn it on. I liked them so much I bought my wife a set too. If you are looking for good quality at an inexpensive price I would go with these. Make some small changes and I would give them 5 stars..

I loved them the sound is excellent & the battery lasts all day. i could literally listen to my music all day at work. This would have been a 5star rating.  But two months later they would not charge anymore and that's was strictly using the supply charger and suitable block. I tried resetting them to no avail. I emailed otium customer service and give a detailed message of the issue and what I needed to do have them replaced or repaired. A few days later they replied telling me to reset it to which I immediately replied that I've had specified I had already tried everything and explain that in the previous email. Then after that a week later they asked me for my mailing address to ship replacement which was already include it in my original email along with my order from Amazon. Finally after two weeks I received my headphones in October. By late November my replacement headphones first stop working in one earbud and then would not charge. I immediately emailed a fully detailed message to Otium again and did not receive a reply for almost a week. It told me to try to reset my device again. I sent another email saying that it does not work I would like it to be replaced as I signed up for the 2-year warranty on their website. For five days later I receive an email telling me that I would have to pay $8 to their PayPal account to have them shipped. I immediately write and included  their entire warranty /return conditions and nowhere does it does it inform that a shipping cost may have to be paid for their faulty product under warranty. Otium completely ignored this email. After a week I emailed them again and said okay send me the PayPal I'll pay you $8 so I can get my new headphones. They did not reply to this and we're now at Christmas. I did however receive emails asking if I would participate testing the new products. I am more disgusted by their horrible customer service than by their discardable product manufacturing.

Fieat of all these are noise canceling - for real. I can keep them in without music and have some peace.
They're comfortable. I must have a deformed ear because headphones and earbuds are NEVER comfortable. These got so snuggly it's like they were made for my ear. AND they stay on! The little hook doohickey works real nice.
The sound..... it's legit. I embarrassed myself this weekend planting while wearing them and singing 70's hits. I havent even turned them up all the way yet but I'm quite satisfied.
They're bluetooth. No wires! I constantly forget I'm so free! No getting caught on door knobs or counters.

Im not really disappointed in that fact since i paid under $20. During the year i gad these i traveled with them frequently and used through work outs.

The over ear bar works great to keep these stable during runs and no discomfort. I will say that the connecting wire between ears can get caught on one side of your head and start to pull the device from you ears. this is not hard to adjust but can be an annoyance.

At right around the one year mark the ear that contains charging port stopped producing sound.

They have served me INCREDIBLY well for the last 10 months. They're comfortable, charge easily, lightweight, and whenever I turn them on, they connect right away to my phone.

The sound quality of these is exceptional, and the Bluetooth works from even across my house.

The only reason I drop a star, is because around November-ish, they stopped pairing as easily with my phone all of a sudden. They would say that they were connected, but they wouldn't play. Once I went to my settings on my phone and clicked connect, then they worked fine, so it was an easy fix.

A week ago, though, they began to cut in and out. I had to hold my phone almost up to my ear in order to keep a strong connection. The sound would drag out for a second, then disconnect. It would disconnect and reconnect maybe up to 50 times during a minute. I tried charging it, and that seemed to fix it, but then yesterday, I accidentally dropped them onto my tile floor, and the cover on the right earbud popped off and got lost, exposing the chip and all the controls. I was INCREDIBLY disappointed, as I've been addicted to these earbuds.

I'm glad they have at least lasted me as long as they have, and I've been mostly very pleased with their performance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I think they feel durable enough, the setup instructions were easy to follow and worked perfectly, and the sound quality of these is really great--sometimes I do wish they got a TINY bit louder, but that thought only ever crosses my mind in SUPER BEAST MODE moments at the gym. I have had the right earpiece fall off twice, both in the last couple of weeks, but that didn't cause the left to fall, so I just stuck the earpiece back on, and problem solved! It's definitely not been an ongoing issue, and I do cardio probably once a week; running or biking or stepping hasn't caused this to happen.

I will also mention that I do wish there were several different sized ear hooks for these, as the one it comes with is a little big for me, but I'm a small girl (5'3"", 106 lbs.), so this probably isn't an issue for most buyers.

I went back and forth for a couple of days, falling into a black hole of online reviews and blog articles, and after weighing the pros and cons, I am so happy I ended up with these.

I have used them to listen to binaural frequencies while sleeping, listen to music on two 10-mile runs, talked on the phone, and used them to listen to music and podcasts at work.

Pros:
Great sound. It is crisp and clear, good bass, and good at noise canceling (Check out the cons for a little more detail on noise canceling)
Awesome battery life. 8+ hours of continuous listening. I have bought a pair of $90 Panasonic BackBeat Pro ear buds that barely last 4 hours.
Awesome price. You can't beat a $20 price tag for bluetooth earbuds.
They charge quite fast. about 1.5 hours from fully dead to fully charged. (It doesn't sound fast, but trust me, it is.)

Cons:
I found them to be quite uncomfortable to wear after an hour or two. This might be subjective to me, as not everyone's ears are shaped the same. They have a snug fit and don't fall out thanks to the over-the-ear design, but they put a lot of pressure on the backside of my ear.
Although they are really good at noise canceling, they give off a lot of noise if you are in a windy environment. I mean LOTS of wind noise. I live near the beach and go for long runs and any crosswind, or head-on wind generates a massive amount of noise to the point where you barely can hear the music. This problem negates any positive of it's noise canceling ability. Go ahead and stand in front of a fan, and you'll see what I'm talking about.

I debated on giving these a 4 star rating, as some of my complaints are more of a personal issue and others might not have the same issues that I have. BUT the wind noise is SO overpowering, that I just can't give them a good rating.

The sound quality was exactly what I was expecting, cheap and lacking a rich clear sound but I was planning on using these for the gym/other exercising purposes so clarity wasn't really a luxury I was able to pay attention to. Unfortunately, after only 6 months of use the left earphone stopped working. I tried to get in touch but I didn't get a response from them for some reason. I didn't bother to try again and decided to deal with the issue. Just recently the other earphone broke too and now I'm out of a set of wireless headphones. Bummer...
Overall, my experience with them was OK. They allowed me to listen to my music wirelessly and provided good battery (as long as you didn't listen to loud music). Initially using these they would rest well in my ear but after prolonged use (1+ hours) they would start hurt my ear canals. The pause play button didn't work as expected either. Single tap paused and resumed music however, double tap wouldn't skip tracks but rather pause then resume immediately. Triple tap was the same thing as double tap except it would pause then resume one more time. If you're expecting to purchase something that'll get he job done, this will do the trick! However, if you want this thing to last a decent while try investing a little bit more money on another product and testing your luck there.

Update: After I had submitted my review the company had almost immediately reached out to me to help me resolve my issue.

I left my review saying the headphones died pretty quickly to me and the seller reached out shortly after that. They sent me a new pair for free and they seem to be working well. Good to know if anything happens in the future they are kind to help with it.

These headphones work pretty well. I like the ear loop for keeping it on. The biggest issue is longevity because they start to die after about 6 months or so.

I am not an audiophile and I can't comment on how sound quality. They sound great to me but if you need high quality music check other reviews.

Look/Design
These look great. Not the nicest I've seen but certainly comparable to ones that cost 4-5 times the price.

Accessories:
They come with an attractive and very convenient carrying case with a caribiner clip. They also come with small, medium, and large ear tips as well as a USB cable, both of which are standard in all wireless headphones.

Use:
These stay in my ears great and feel very comfortable. I hear the sounds great and unlike most other Bluetooth headphones in this process range the people I spoke to over the phone had no problem hearing me whatsoever.

Distance- The connection was great until about 30 feet even with a wall in the way.

Cons-
This first con is a con with virtually all Bluetooth headphones. The lackbof enough buttons. There is only 3 buttons - volume up, volume down, and power and with those three buttons I need to be able to do about fifteen functions such as change tracks, pair Bluetooth, redial, answer calls, etc. Extra buttons would be useful. I'm not holding this against them because all Bluetooth headphones have this issue.

The second gripe I have is that in the title these are listed as noise cancelling. They are not. In the description noise cancelling is not listed at all which makes me suspect that it was put in the product title by mistake. I deducted 1 star because although these are great headphones I was expecting noise cancelling.

I cannot comment in the waterproof feature as the most water they have gotten on them was when I walked through a drizzle. They did fine but virtually every headphone would have.

Bottom line- I've tried at least 10 different pairs of Bluetooth headphones in this price range and so far it seems this is among the best for talking on the phone or listening to podcasts. If they remove the words noise cancelling from the product title I'd gladly give it 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

That said, for my purposes (largely just listening to audiobooks while walking), the sound quality is perfect.  They're comfortable in my ears, the battery life is fantastic, and I couldn't believe how easy it was to pair them with my iPad.  Seriously took me something like five seconds.  Easiest pairing ever.

Considering the price, I think these may be the best headphones I've owned, when all factors are considered.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to other audiobook listeners.

(Like I said, YMMV when it comes to music.  I suspect there may be a bit of tinniness to them, which might make them unsuitable for folks who are really into their music.  If a factory car radio offends you, I'd skip these and go a bit more premium.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The setup is easy as any other Bluetooth device and the battery is on par with other earbuds. I like how the controls are on the earpiece and not the cord so it keeps the earbuds from tugging during runs and workouts.

The ear loop doesn't do much to keep the buds in place so like most earbuds, you're depending on the buds being firmly crammed in your ear canal to stay in place during an intense workout. They'll stay on your ear, but not IN your ear. My biggest problem with these is the sound. Like the title, it's all bass and no treble giving everything a muffled sound. To make sure it was the Otiums I tried another set of headphones and they sounded fine. Even going back to the Otiums I tried adjusting the EQ settings on my phone. When I turned up the treble, everything got so muffled that I could barely hear anything.

I ultimately ended up going back to my old headphones until I get find something better than these.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I'm not sure if it's the phone or the new iOS but these headphones do not work with the iphone 11. They will pair, and they will play music, but you can't push the button on the headset to pause/play the music, and you can't even pause by pressing the button on the iphone. You have to completely turn off the headset to get the music to pause. And then if you turn it back on again you have to start the music from the iphone, you can't press the button on the headset.

If you don't want to replace your headphones every six months, these won't be right for you. If it bothers you that the headphones will stop accepting a charge after that time, and, instead, you'll have some nice plastic and rubber ear accessories that can't even power on, you might like to look elsewhere.

I've wanted something that I didn't have to be tethered to give me more mobility. Running on a treadmill, I've been holding my device (becuase...wired headphones) which I have dropped on more than one occasion. And the other wireless earbuds I have don't have any kind of cord, so when one falls out, I run the risk of stepping on it or losing it completely. These don't fall out!! And if they do, I have the peace of mind that they are soft tethered to my ears, and then to each other while still being wireless. They are also comfortable. I have worn these for several hours at a time around the house. If I do have to take them off for a minute, I hang them around my neck.
  Noise cancellation is good, and charging is easy.  Sound quality is good, with a good ratio of base to treble. Battery life  is also decent. They outlast the battery on my mp3 player.

Good range. My issue is that the ear pieces (on the exterior) are too big for my ears and hang over them, which looks real stupid. Also, the band which connects the two pieces doesn't lay symmetrically and often feels like it's pulling. Any movement of the band causes sound in the ear which is distracting. Finally, when the battery starts to get low, there's an alert that happens every 5 minutes, and it's so annoying that I always just stop using them.

UPDATE:
Otium sent me an alternative product, Otium Magnetic Wireless Earbuds IPX7 Waterproof in-Ear Sports Earphones, which is a FAR superior product.

I would give this 5 stars but I had a heck of time getting these initially charged and connected to phone via Bluetooth, plus the instructions could have been a little more detailed.  Once connected they work great.  When you press and hold a button on the side of the right earphone, a voice tells you that the headphones are on.  Press and hold again and the voice tells you the headphones are off.  Once connected to your main Bluetooth device, they automatically reconnect each time you use them.

I have used bluetooth headphones before and I found they would not work well while bike riding--they would cut in and out frequently. I figured it may have been because my iPhone app for cycling was possibly hogging bandwidth. I'm probably wrong but it was so noticeable I used some wired plugs instead. Then they were getting  finicky due to corrosion on the plugs so I tried bluetooth again.
These work great. I've been using them for several weeks and I haven't had any issues with them on bike rides. I've tried them once or twice while running and they stay in--great for running and cycling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

• Secure, comfy ear bud fit – the over-the-ear pieces are probably not even necessary.
• Hard to believe – ALL functions work as promised.
• So easy to use.
• Phone communication is clear for both parties.
• This is my 3rd try with a BT “necklace” headset – 3rd one’s the charm AND the least expensive.
• Carrying case – a terrific bonus – attractive – roomy enough to include lip balm, money, charge cord, small mirror, hair clips, etc... AND it has a sturdy carabiner hook.
• Neck cord shortener – another bonus – shortened cord can be clipped under hair so it doesn’t contact neck.
• An excellent  gift to give.
• Arrived in 2 days!
• Only 1 problem –  I mistakenly ordered the red cord instead of the black. Truly – NOT a problem at all.

They work quite well, and sound just as good as any other Bluetooth headset. Bluetooth isn't a great transmission system for high quality audio, no matter what brand you buy. The limitation is Bluetooth, not the headset.

With that in mind, I can't agree with people who claim other Bluetooth earbuds sound much better. From AirPods to Bose Bluetooth, they all suffer the same quality issues.

Ignoring the deficiencies in Bluetooth transmission, the sound that you get has decent bass, and highs. The volume level is fine, and the battery life is about 8 hours.

I'd recommend these, especially at the price point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I use a battery pack to charge them in my car when I'm done for the day. They last about 7-8 hours on a full charge. The audio quality is great. I do wish they went a little louder so I could hear over the vacuum better, but that's an isolated issue. I don't get the multiple low-battery warnings. Just once about 5 minutes before they actually die. I haven't had a single issue with these headphones and I've had them the longest I've had any other ones.

I've worn them for up to 30 minutes at a time and not had sore ears that I've had with most cheaper earphones.

Cannot comment on battery life as I never use more than 30 minutes on a single charge.

Deducted one star because of the misuse of the term ""noise cancelling"" in the description. These do not actively cancel noise. They muffle noise, just like earplugs would. It is an important distinction not made clear in the description. That being said, they do seem to muffle exterior noise fairly well, but it is important to remember that they are not earplugs. (I would not use them occupationally for ear protection). They will not perform nearly as well as actual noise cancelling headphones.

Edit: After a year, I came back and deducted another star due to the ridiculously excessive ""battery low"" warning that starts at about 25%. It repeats ""battery low"" every few minutes until you charge it. One warning, or flashing the led would be enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I burn through headphones having used many sets under a helmet for turn by turn navigation and tunes while riding motorcycle.

Wireless is imperative to save your phone output jack, and keep the nav instructions coming.

Every time you remove a helmet you risk breaking headsets, no matter how nice they are. (unless helmet mounted).

Finding a great set around $20 is tough, but these for the application perfectly!

Plenty loud, I often keep music turned down on the phone and navigation voice hurts my ears at Max volume!

Last 4-5 hours riding listening to podcasts easily. Claims 8 hour life, and that it possible if you turn the volume down in a quiet room. I find it charges in 30 minutes or so, so bring a small charger with if you want to keep them alive on an international flight with layovers.

Edit*
Microphone never really worked properly to capture sound for phone calls. None of these style earbuds work well but these are especially bad. Reducing a star for bad phone call quality. Still great for tunes/podcasts and turn by turn navigation under a helmet.

And this week they finally stopped working after about 6 months of hard use, they still connect and play fine through right side but the left became intermittent abd now stopped working. This is almost certainly due to abuse and not a defective product. They spent time under helmets and take a beating removing it after a ride, also spent days and days in my pockets getting abused by keys and the like. Overall a good product that holds up as well as anything else I've tried, at a lower price point that I can afford to keep replacing without breaking the bank like other higher end options. I'm trying other options in this price range as of now, but revert to the Otiums as a safe baseline Performance per dollar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Wear them at the gym and they stay in, even with 20 min's on treadmill. I have big ears and all other buds would fall out. So far I've only recharged once, and it notified me twice every 10 min's before dying. Only concern I have is that the piece that goes over ear is bendable. I thought they would be solid.

Can't believe these are so cheap!","August 15, 2017","I was expecting a lot after reading the glowing reviews here and man, I was NOT disappointed! The quality of the sound here is unbelievable for the size and price. I used to have a pair of nose headphones (wired) that sounded amazing... the sound here reminds me of those very much. Very clear mids and highs, and a surprising amount of bass for something this small. They're not perfect, however... with low frequency bass you can clearly hear it distorting, but honestly, just the fact that it can produce some of these sounds is impressive to me. As far as the form factor, these are great as well. They fit right in my ear and don't move at all, even while running. I don't think I even really need the ear loop but it's nice to have and makes me feel like they're more secure. I also really love that the volume controls on the headphones adjust the volume on my phone... all my other Bluetooth headphones have separate volume for the device itself and my phone. Here it's integrated into a single volume. Plus, you get a nice carrying case and a clip to hold the excess wire behind your head so it doesn't trail as much. All this for only $20... it's rather unbelievable.

They sound bargain as well. feel cheap","June 11, 2019","The price point is what you are paying for here. I came from LG 910s until the new ones come out i needed something cheap and i saw these. The drop in quality is like comparing talking to someones soul directly vs talking to someone through 2 cans tied together with string. The sound quality is so wonkee its like super bass but it wants to sound clear its sounds like shit.  They feel really cheap too. (nitpicks incoming)  Having one in and one hanging out is a pain in the ass because the one side out jerks the other side outta your ear(Adjusting the cable clip seems to make no difference). The noise cancellation you get from these is too good if you work in construction or don't wanna be one of those idiots walking down the street with BOTH earphones in while there's heavy traffic all over then avoid these. If your at the gym though and wanna be lost in your thoughts of what headphones to buy next then look no further.

The good points is that they are cheap. Charge decently quick, the color scheme is simple and slick. The UX though is kinda rough one button for more than 4 functions is a no no. They work only after trying it a couple of times. The minimalist design is good though. nice and clicky buttons, water resistant. they stay on your neck pretty well. I ride around in an offroad dumptruck sometimes and they stay on very well but this is an extreme situation.

After I initially left this review they reached out to me and offered to send me a new set, along with allowing me to help their R&D department improve their product. However I respectfully declined.

Alright so let me write this out, I’ve had these puppies for almost a year now so if there’s a review to listen to it’s this one.
When I first got them I was like “these things are sweet they’re a bargain deal” and now I see why people spend money on nice things. I used these to work out. Initially they were great but as the time has grown on, I’ve noticed some things, some minor some large.
The ear piece doesn’t really fit that well, and they don’t offer adjustment at all. You have to rely on the squishy buds being able to hold them in your ear. The band that goes around your head sticks to your neck especially once you start to sweat and if you turn your head enough it’ll rip one out of your ear - I constantly have to find myself recentering the band so this doesn’t happen.
The Bluetooth is terrible, it has a range of maybe 12 feet but if there is ANYTHING including your arm or leg of your shorts (???) in the way you get a disrupted signal. This to me is annoying as all hell half the time I don’t even work out with music anymore.

With all that being said, they do sound great especially for the price. A little too much bass which isn’t a problem if you listen to edm or rap but for rock music it’s slightly annoying.

So if you use these to work out it’s a terrible idea which is how they’re marketed. HOWEVER if you’re the kind of cancerous person that uses headphones while you drive,  or on public transport these are perfect for you.

I’m also an industrial designer so this is my wheelhouse and in the most humble way possible like I said this is your most valued opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Buying another pair!","December 4, 2018","These are great cheap headphones! No lie, I'm incredibly impressed with these. The quality is phenomenal for such a low price! Sure, they're not, like Bose or Samsung wireless buds but these things went through my washing machine in my leggings pocket and they still worked afterwards. (I put them in a bag of rice for a day and it worked like a charm.) Bluetooth connectivity used to be really good, I could walk away for 20 feet or more and only have a few blips in sound, not sure if that took a dive because of the washer situation or if the gym I go to now has a lot more people using bluetooth headphones causing interference. Although before they went through the wash they would randomly disconnect sometimes and it was rather odd. But turning them on and off usually fixed it.  Either way, Love these! Gonna buy another pair! In part because the ones that went through the wash are a little less good in the sound department but also cause I'd like to be able to alternate when one set is charging.

Pros: great quality sound for a cheap price, bluetooth, fairly long battery life, holy cow waterproof, bluetooth connectivity decent.

Cons: fall off your ears sometimes, battery life varies with how well you take care of them (over-charging, blaring volume, leaving them connected without turning them off), sometimes the bluetooth connectivity can be interfered by other bluetooth stuff or just walls, power button placement is somewhat awkward -if the headphone is falling out of your ear you will sometimes accidentally push the pause button while trying to shove it back in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Battery life is great for how small they are, hours of listening time and days of standby. The fit comfortably on my ear and do not slip out despite any exercise activity I've thrown at them. They're also comfortable to use for prolong periods of time, unlike previous in-ear headset I've used in the past.
I would have no issues recommending or re-purchasing these IPX7 Bluetooth headphones.

UPDATE: 08/14/2019 - Battery life is still. I use them nearly ever day during the week, twice a day during my morning and afternoon commute to work, 15-20 minutes per use. I charge it on Sunday and pretty much leave it unplugged throughout the week. So far, it lasted all the way through Friday afternoon without any needing to be recharged.
As for the performance, that a different story. Not sure what happen when, but depending on who the cable rest in the back of my head, the audio might cut off one of the ear pieces for a second or two, or come across with a bit of static. It doesn't always do it and it doesn't last a long time, usually shifting the cable is enough to reset the issue, but it has become noticeable over the past couple weeks. Again, I do not think this is a fault of the manufacturing process, more than likely a result of one of the kid messing with it, but felt it should be noted.  It is advertised as a sports headphone, so I expect it to survive a bit of rough housing, but I also don't expect miracle when it comes to it being kid proof.

They wirelessly paired up easily with my laptop and several Windows- and Android-based cellphones I own.  The audio clarity is remarkable across a wide range of volume (Careful!  Loud is really LOUD with these earbuds!).  I listened to different channels on JazzRadio.com just to get a variety of high and low-pitched instruments playing together.  WOW, these buds reproduce everything from a thumping bass to a squealing blues harmonica or Hawaiian steel guitar just perfectly.  And the ""presence"" is remarkable; sounds like being in a room full of musicians; or should I say, like having a jazz joint strapped to your head.  The noise cancelling on these buds appears to be ""passive"" (noise isolating), not ""active"" (electronic noise-signal inversion and cancellation):  Just plug 'em in your ears more tightly to reduce outside noise.  This works fine for me while listening to music from my cellphone as I walk or jog along a noisy street.

These earbuds are comfortable on my ears, light-weight and unobtrusive feeling.  Volume up/down buttons work just fine, even with my large fingers.  In my experience, however, the forward/back skip function (longer depressions of the volume up/down buttons) does not seem to work with Amazon Music either online or offline.  Same for Pandora Radio.  Maybe it would work with iPhone / iTunes, which I have not tried.  This shortcoming is OK with me.

Telephone-related functionality of the buttons on these earbuds works fine.  Telephone audio quality as heard in the earbuds is excellent; the called party says the audio quality on that end is ""satisfactory"".

These Otium earbuds are a great buy!  I spent much more on other earbuds from Amazon that claimed to have active noise cancelling; I returned those earbuds when I found the noise cancelling to be non-working or ineffective.

The ear buds fit comfortably and don’t fall out, and I love that the controls are on the earpiece and not the cord! No more fumbling! The on/off button is a big button right on the other side of my right ear! The battery seems to run about 8 hours, as advertised; I’ve only been woken up a few times in the morning by a soft voice telling me the battery was low!😉 After I received this one, I was so impressed that I immediately bought a second one for downstairs! Other pluses: One: It works with the language flashcard programs on my phone! (Believe it or not, a lot of earbuds don’t, for some reason).

It works better than I was expecting.  Here are some pros and cons:
Pros:
1. Nice sound and bass. It is not as good as my Sony headphone but I will say about 80% as good. I could hear the treble with the clear sound.
2. It is easy to pair. What you need to do is just turned it on and found it in the Bluetooth setting.
3. Lots of different ear tips included in the case. The small ones fit me the best.
4. Battery can last a few hours.
5. Easy controls.  The buttons are located in the right headphone.
6. Easy carry.  It can be carried in pocket with the shell case.
Cons:
1. Not comfortable when you wear it for an extended period of time. It hurt the ears. I use it only when I am doing workout.

I can wear them for hours without even notice it, since they are comfortable and lightweight. silicon ears hooks are very flexible, and already installed earbuds are the most common ears size and i just wear them as they are. I find these earbuds  to give some passive background noises cancellation, just by wearing them, even no music is being played.

When I at the gym or just outside walking/running, the last thing i wanna do is balancing my headphones back on my ears. Many types of headphones have controllers on the wire. despite the fact it doesn’t look that good, it also take off the balance from the headset, and many times you find yourself repositioning them. Not in this case. Controllers here was placed on the headphones. With one multifunction button on the front, and the rest on the top. They are responsive and easy to reach without taking a look.

Paring these headphones was fast and smooth with the voice guided system that alerts you when entered pairing mode, when successfully paired, for incoming calls, low battery level and more.The BT range is enormous. I live in second floor. I left my phone on my desk and went down to the street. Well, i was still able to receive calls, listen to music, and all without interruption.Sound quality is nothing but amazing.

I have a few different sets of headphones as I work out a lot as a firefighter and I am also an audio engineer, but by no means are these pro mixing headphones and nor should be treated as such.

These are fun, easy to use headphones that I wanted for running. I run a lot as physical training is important. Since these are both attached, I normally don't use these at the station, but when I'm training on my days off. I like that these are over the head, so when I start to sweat, they stay put.

The sound is pretty good, it is no $200 set of high audio, but I'd say beat any pair of beats any day. Perfect for running outdoors or on a hike. They can get pretty loud, but I don't really like to listen to my music too loud.

Cons, They are a little big, so if you have smaller ears like me, the smallest size is still a bit too big.

Upgraded my rating to a 5 star from a 2! Really awesome customer support and resolved my issues very satisfactorily. They are very open to customer concerns and takes pride in their service and products!

Past review:
I don't usually write bad reviews. Specially for something that doesn't cost much to buy. But I have been really disappointed with this pair of headphones. Will continue to use for a few more months until I can find a better pair.

I guess things like these comes in good or bad batches. I got the worst batch unfortunately. Hope you guys are luckier.

Oh! Do follow the advice of not using a fast USB charger to charge these. I failed to listen for another pair from a different manufacturer and sure enough, I fried those pair after a few months. Those were really good too! And this new pair was to replace the ones I fried.

Pros:
1. Good fit
2. Good battery life

Cons:
1. Terribly muddy sound! I tried everything! With, without EQ. Low low low bass settings, high mid and hi freq setting. But can't get rid of the muddiness. Really dissapointing.
2. Asked seller about what can be done. No response. Probably because too may people are complaining.

Update July 16, 2019
Finally received response. But I have already returned the item and now waiting for a refund. I bought another pair from a different manufacturer that didn't have any problems before.

Have asked this mfg to contact me if they have a better product that has also been tested thoroughly before shipping them to customers. I will certainly give them another shot as I truly believe in second chances.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I reached out to customer service when one of my headphones stopped working.  They told me I was out of the warranty period, and to try to ""hold down the power button"".

I work on electronics, so I opened them up.  The soldering on my set of headphones was terrible.  I fixed a bad connection on one of my headphones, then two weeks later they stopped working completely, so I opened up the other bud to find a bad connection to the battery!

I use these maybe once a week at my desk when the office is loud.  I agree that I was out of the warranty period, but these things were very lightly used, so I have no idea how the connections are coming apart.  The only thing I can think of is that they were barely making electrical connections to begin with.

Judging by my experience with these headphones,  you could luck out and get a great sounding set of headphones, or you could get a pair that fall apart from sitting on a desk and being used a few times a month.  I'm not trying to sound disgruntled... They were only $20...

It's a great deal if they don't break.  I think I will probably just spend extra money on a brand that has a better chance of lasting longer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Decided to dive into wireless, although I'm not exactly excited about having another device to charge.
The fit is very comfortable, and they don't feel like they will fall out at all.
Travelling on a plane isn't an issue. The earbuds seal well enough to keep out a majority of the sound, blocking me from needing to jack the volume up to max on my phone or computer.
The sound is crisp and clear, probably some of the best earbuds I've had in that regard, even for pairs costing 2x+ the amount I paid for these.
The mic appears lack luster. I took a few phone calls, and although people could hear me, they said it sounded like I was far away. I didn't buy them with any expectation of using them for that, but I probably would have gone 5 stars had that worked seamlessly.
The battery life seems solid, I can't quote an hour amount, but I've only had them die once, and that was after I had used them while going to sleep and they had stayed on (sometimes transmitting audio) all night.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

UPDATE: the unit i received might be an isolated case but nonetheless i commend OTIUM for their outstanding customer service. as soon as they saw my post they immediately  contacted me and they tried to resolve my issue. since then i changed my review to I LIKE IT for reason that they stand to their product. i have not received the replacement unit but i am satisfied with the way they handled my situation. Great Service - THANKS OTIUM for your outstanding serivice.

UPDATE: 9/3/2017: received the replacement unit and this one is way better than the first one i got. bass and treble is balanced. sound is not flat and has great sound. AWESOME product. built quality is top notch. you wouldn't think that this a $20 earphone.

As described,  you get them pretty much in your ears,  then  twist them while slightly pushing in so the ear bands are nice and tight around your ear.  I got them on perfectly.  I then had an experience,  I can only describe as being an assault on the hearing senses by a quality built audio masterwork.  They are so clear,  they actually create soundstaging,  imaging,  and things all without distortion.  I can't turn them all the way up.  So,  I don't know how loud they go.  You have plenty of room to work with.  Finally.  A set of ear buds that are so loud they can actually cause ear damage!!!!!!!!  Yay!  This doesn't mean you turn it all the way up and relax.  It just gives you the room you need to accommodate your maximum volume.  They rock.  Buy them.
Update:  every pair of ear buds I ever had,  seemed to move if I yawned or raised my eyebrows.  These don't move.  Get them in properly,  and you'll know there in properly.  These are the best ear buds I ever heard.  Oh,  and by the way,  no there are no bass booster,  or other equalizer settings.  You don't need them.  The sound is already as good as it gets.  And they set a nice high bar.  Very nice.
Update:  it's scary how nice these are.  The price doesn't seem to match the item.  This is totally confounding me.  Under $20?  Ok,  what game is this?

I bought these for the first time 2 years ago and used them daily(nightly) until 3 weeks ago when they finally failed.  I use these at night in bed as to not disturb my wife while I watch videos on my phone. The battery life is unreal on these.  They claim 8 hours but I have gotten 12-14 hours between charges.  I had a spare pair of knock-off Airpods that I tried to use after my first set of Otiums broke and they were awful.  I went right back and ordered another pair.

My only complaint is the insanely bright blue LED that indicates it's on. Whoever thought using a super bright blue LED for anything indicator wise needs to try and use on at night.  When I had my first pair, I opened them up and removed the resistor feeding the blue LED. It helped battery life slightly but more so, it made them not obnoxiously bright at night in bed.  This was when I also noticed the first pair had wax as a conformal coating to protect from moisture.  When they finally failed a few weeks ago, I opened them again to see if I could fix it and saw the wax had slid down from heat and water/sweat had corroded the PCB near the main chip.

When I opened the new pair to unhook the same resistor, I see that they have now gone to a silicone or mastic coating to water protect the board.  That will be infinitely more effective in my opinion. It's nice to see the design improve.

If you want good quality earphones with a long as heck battery life, buy these.  They are great.  I will buy another pair soon to put away as a backup. They are that great where its worth it entirely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I use them all the time (Calls while driving, calls at work, working out and listening to videos).  The battery life is very good at ~3 days in my normal usage.  The sound output quality is very good and no one has ever complained about the outgoing audio, so I assume that too is good.  I like having the phone controls through the headphones, as I can pickup and hangup calls without taking my phone out of my pocket.  My old Otium headphones allowed me to activate Siri from the headset, but I haven't figured out how to do that here.  The comfort is good, but they are a little bulkier than the around the neck style.  The over the ear clips do make them more secure.

They last plenty long. I have only used them for a couple to a few hours every couple days, but then I charge them overnight when I think about it about once a week or so. They sound as good as inexpensive headphones with a cord (that is to say, fine) and I never wore them in the shower, but I like that they're water resistant. Also, I mainly used them outside with my phone on me, but I never had any issues with range or connection.

The only problem I have had with them is that when I bike fast, the air really catches in the ear pieces and it makes the wind really loud. Even with high volume you really can't hear your music. Just wind in the ear pieces. At slower speeds they're fine.

There is a little bit of a learning curve on how to use the controls, but then it's easy peasy.  I saw complaints of non-pairing with devices, and this happened to me with my ipod and a blue tooth speaker.  Just delete the earbuds from the device, and it re-pairs no problem.

I love the fact that they are wireless headphones and have a long battery life. It is very convenient to be able to control the volume on the earpiece, and after reading the instructions carefully, I found it very convenient to switch and change songs efficiently all by pressing the button on the right earpiece. Nice added bonus is that this purchase comes with different sizes of your covers so that the cushiony silicone earbuds fit bests to the individual’s ears.

They are not as moisture wicking as I was hoping, especially because I get very sweaty when I workout at the gym. However, these are very good at canceling out noise. It’s difficult to hear somebody talking next to you, especially if the volume is at a medium level. I really like the fact that the earpiece goes over your ear and helps keep it secure well you are running or being very active.

As mentioned earlier, the battery life is amazing. I can go about a week or more without having to charge them. To give you a better idea of the battery life, are usually work out about 3 to 4 times a week for about an hour. I can go without having to charge these headphones for a couple weeks. The headphones will also give you a warning when the battery is low, and you can also visualize the amount of charge left by looking at your phone and seeing how far or how low the battery icon is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Cauvin","Works for Listening to Music but not for Phone Calls","April 17, 2019","I have another set of Otium headphones that work really well: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D9LZ8KB.

What I like about the other headphones is that they work really well with phone calls, and they conveniently wrap around my neck and clasp together with magnets. I have recommended those headphones to friends.

I figured that another set of headphones would be nice to have at the office so I would have them in case I forgot to bring the other headphones from home, and I decided to try this model. I also thought this model might stay on better when I exercise.

After using this model for a couple of weeks, I have come to the following conclusions:

1. For listening to music and podcasts, the sound is loud and clear.
2. The sound is a bit “tinny”, maybe too much treble.
3. For voice calls, the microphone appears not to work well, as the person on the other end can barely hear me.
4. The ear fasteners do secure these headphones and keep them from falling out of my ears when I am exercising.
5. Carrying these headphones on a daily basis is a little inconvenient. My other Otium headset has magnets, so it is easy to wear it around my neck all day without fear of it falling to the ground.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Set up was effortless, controls are easy to get used to, but main perk, the sound on these are amazing, at least compared to my now dead LGs.
Very rich, full sound. Volume is much more powerful than the LG. Now I know why they put the warnings on the volume control. These actually could cause damage if turned up too loud.
So far I've only tried the buds that they came with, and they seem fine. Fit securely and pretty sure I won't have to take them off when doing my floor exercises as I had to do with my last pair.

I use them daily for at least a couple of hours, and I haven't had any issues yet.  My only complaint is that the longest life the battery has had at full charge when listening to music has been 2-2.5 hours.  That's nowhere close to the up to 8 hours the description claims.  But when the battery does die, the headphones do charge relatively quickly.  They're back at 100% in less than 30 minutes.  Since I use these during my workouts, the 2 hour battery life is sufficient.  Just don't plan on listening to music on these all day on without having to charge multiple times during the day.  They are very comfortable to wear, and they do a fair job of cancelling out most noise.  When my neighbor decides to be loud, I pop these headphones in while watching tv or listening to music to help drown her out.  As long as the noise isn't obnoxiously loud, these headphones do the job.

I just wanted a pair of headphones that I could use to work out with, so I didn't have high expectations. However, after one use I am returning these headphones (and paying the $6 shipping to do so).

Let's start with the good. They fit comfortably, probably even more so than my last pair. That's about it.

The bass on these are so incredibly high that I couldn't even recognize the song I was trying to listen to. And I was listening to AC/DC. I could barely even hear Angus' guitar solos and Bon Scott screaming his lungs out over the incredibly amplified bass guitar and drums, which is saying something because the lowest volume setting on these is approximately equivalent to Metallica playing a concert on an airstrip while 747s fly 10 feet over your head and construction crews use jackhammers to tear up the runway. I'm pretty sure the music coming from these headphones on the lowest setting was louder than the music playing over the speakers in the gym.

I will be paying the $6 shipping to return these because I value my hearing and don't want to pop an eardrum mid workout. All I wanted was a regular pair of headphones to workout with, not one that made Cliff Williams' bass guitar the focal point of AC/DC.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I even tried changing the rubber bud since it came with different sizes. I still can't keep them in. Tried working out with them and that was a nightmare. The sweat made them come out even more so I quit using them all together for anything other than while I'd be sitting very still.

Edit May 31 2018: The company reached out and offered to replace the ones I had. It came quickly and I actually had a marginally better experience with the new pair than the original. The new pair doesn't slip out at the sign of sweat but they still don't fit in my ears properly. I've tried all the earbud sets they came with but they still won't stay in securely. Or ... if they do ... They clog your ear, not just fit, clog. It feels as if you're in an airplane. But when you adjust them, you hear all the noise around you so you can either clog your ear or just rest them inside. Or ... If you happen to get them in just right ... And then do something like talk or smile (which I do a lot), that adjusts the fit. They're alright if you're desperate to get through your workout but it can be annoying. The sound quality is actually good ... If you can get them to stay in.

But just remember ... Everyone's ears are different. They didn't stay in well in mine. But they're super easy to pair and pair quickly and are more reliable than the other brand I purchased.

Here's my review of this device:

They were the largest of the group.  The sets are large and stick far out of the ear which, by the way, makes reaching the controls easy but does not suit my needs. They were also not very secure.  Being large I would think a much larger retention mechanism would help but then that would make it larger still and down the rabbit hole we go.  The sound quality was good with decent bass response but nothing to write home about.

They were marginally difficult to pair taking two touches of the scan button on my phone. They powered on quickly and the button are easy to reach and learn (only three buttons).  All the buttons responded well for what they are.  I would prefer a separate track control button(s) and volume controls but it seems that the standard is to group functions on single buttons.  You have to hold the volume + button for three seconds to advance to the next track.  Play/pause is grouped on the power button which requires a three second press to toggle power.

At $20 they were reasonably priced if not for the fact that I didn't care for them.

I could find the right ones that come with it but fortunately I always keep the earbuds from other earphones when they die out. The key is the better the fit, the more bass you'll get, but with the openings not too small that it kills the treble. Once the right fit is made, the overall sound quality is quite good. Some other reviews complain that the + / - controllers should be reversed but I haven't found that to be a problem when you get used to it. It paired without any problems to my iPhone 7 and connectivity every time I've turned it on has been fast and I've rarely found any break up in signal living in NYC. They fit over my ear fine and I've been able to wear them for long periods of time without any discomfort.

Sound quality is excellent and they are perfect for workouts and everyday wear. There’s one fault with the overall system and not really the headphones: the caribiner. They come with the product and are meant to be attached to things. I used it to attach the headphones to my backpack. A few times, I had noticed that the clip to lock the caribiner in place seemed to be a bit flimsy and I would have to flick it back into place. I made a mental note to either replace it or move it to a different place in my backpack. Well sadly, I never got the chance. Looked down one day and realized they were gone and had probably fallen off at some point. Now I don’t live in a major city so pick-pocketing is kind of low on my list of what could have happened to them. I really only use my backpack for going to and from class. I’m extremely disappointed that they’re gone so soon. I recommended them to everyone and barely even had them a month.

C.","No complaints","July 25, 2019","If you're a commuter and you're looking to block out ambient noises, there are some sounds you're just not going to block out with earbuds, period. At least this has been my experience no matter which earbuds I've tried. Sounds such as the subway train as it arrives, and super loud commuters. That said these earbuds do a decent job of blocking out most noises. For the super loud commuters, it won't drown out their voices completely but for the most part you won't be able to make out what the other people are saying, you'll just hear their voices. Think Charlie Brown's teacher.

I don't have much of an opinion on the bass because I don't pay much attention to it.

I can say that pairing was a breeze and the connections stays strong even if your phone or device is in another room and you've walked away. Also, the volume on the earbuds are separate from your phone. So if your phone's volume is at max and you can still hear that business person act like a complete and utter... jerk... you can turn up the volume on the earbuds and drown him out with some decent music.

The case they come with is great. You may want to eventually replace the carabiner that comes with it though. I haven't had any issues with it but it just seems fragile.

They definitely stay on my ears and fit around my industrial and daith piercings comfortably.

As for controls, like most earbuds, it comes with a multifunction button and volume buttons. Although it's by far the easiest pair to figure out. The manual helps but when you forget what does what it's super easy to figure out what makes your music skip or repeat.

So far the mic has been great. No one has complained, and in fact they couldn't tell whether I was in my office or walking around outside.

The bad:
They are advertised as to stay in your ear. What they do is stay attached to your ear lobe with the hook, but move a lot.
The ugly:
It does have a great range, except when on for over 15 minutes. The sound  consistently  starts dropping after about 15 minutes of use. I thought it may be my phone, but used my old 4 year old pair for over an hour and never had the issue in the same environment.

Luckily I still have my old pair which is actually noise cancelling and does not drop sound.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have worn them practically everyday for the past three weeks, mostly for several consistent hours during the day listening to the news and various audiobooks. I keep one headphone in one ear, and tuck the other away on the front of my shirt collar. Ive never had any issues with the battery draining down at all, so I’d say the hour rating is pretty accurate. Ive worn them during workouts also while having no issues with them falling out or any moisture issues. They also stay surprisingly clean compared to my white earbuds that I used prior to buying these. The sound quality is comparable to many headphones that I’ve owned for more than double the cost of these. The bass can be a bit much on some songs but I just prefer my music a bit more treble based. I solved this by changing the settings on my phones equalizer. They do have phone and Siri function too so if you’re looking for a set that you can make and receive calls on, these will do the job. I used them for several hour long phone calls while driving which kept me from having to hold my phone.

As for any issues I had, they were very, very minor. They turn on by holding the main button on the right down until you hear the chime, though thats not the same button you use to change or rewind songs. The main button serves the purpose of turning the on and off, pausing audio, and calling the last person in your recent call log, the latter being the most confusing to me since I’ve never had need for that function nor known a headset to have that function. I made a few accidental calls getting used to this. I have an iPhone, so in my case the Siri function, along with the song change and replay function was accessed through the volume buttons on the top of the right headphone. The button function between the two seems a bit odd to me, but overall this has nothing to do with the functioning of the headset itself. Other than that, you have to hang the other headphone on your shirt if you only want to have one in your ear because the second headphone will weigh the wire down making it pull on the headphone that is currently in.
Pros:
 -THE MOST comfortable in ear headphones I’ve owned
 -good bluetooth range and quick connection
 -great sound and bass
 -lightweight
 -great battery life
 -they charge quickly
 -stylish
 -what you see in the pictures is exactly what you get
 -Siri and phone call ability
 -they stay surprisingly clean considering what I do all  day at work
 -excellent for exercise
Cons:
 -odd button function","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I plug them in to charge for hours, and they are always ""battery low"" after charging for hours. They simply won't hold a charge.

I've also never had a) wireless headphones or b) in the ear headphones as I generally prefer apple headphones for everything.

Pros: fit well/don't fall out of ears (if you figure out how to get them in - need to literally push them in your ears), gives you several removable sizing options for the bud part, connects to Bluetooth really well, long range of distance before audio cuts out (maybe around 20 ft), can't complain about sound quality as it's pretty good.

Cons: this is a huuuuge con for me, but it isn't sensitive enough to get volume. I literally always have it on the lowest possible option and it's still too loud for me, so I really feel like these are damaging my ears. You also need to push them in so that they fit, and I'm not sure if higher-end earbuds require a lot of fiddling, but these do. They also are not extremely comfortable, I couldn't see myself wearing them for more than an hour.

OVERALL: if you need some cheap earbuds for working out, or walking short distances, these are totally fine! If these are your end all be all earbuds that you use for everything, I'd consider a different brand. To put it into perspective, these buds have enough small annoyances for me that I would probably not rebuy. My favorite part about them is that they are wireless, but there are tons of Bluetooth headphones out there might as well find a better one!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They stick in my ear is good, which is nice for working out. And they have a pretty decent charge. They pair easily.  All in all, they're great headphones. BUT...

what kind of absolute buffoon would design a pair if headphones that have a blue and red flashing light in the front of them?!?!  Every time I am in the car at night, I forget that those blue and red lights flashing in my rearview mirror are my headphones, and not police pulling me over.  Every.  Time.

Sure, you say, you wouldn't get used to it. You would remember it was, and it wouldn't bother you.

They battery lasts long enough as long as you remember to charge them after use they last through 1 or 2 good listening sessions. Nice and loud.

They held a charge (for the most part) and had good sound quality. I relied on them for about 10 hours a day during this span. However, about 3 and a half months in, the left ear started cutting in and out as if there was a short. I immediately contacted otium's customer service to let them know. Once we determined I'd need knew earbuds, they made up a holiday week in the middle of January and ghosted me for over 2 weeks. During the time, the original short developed in to an inability to charge and, plainly, broken headphones. I still haven't heard back from them in regards to the replacement the warranty holds them to and I really don't expect to at this point. I've read through other reviews and anyone who has these headphones in the 3-5 month range seems to encounter a very similar story.

Whether I’m working out or cooking and just going for a walk these headphones make it much better with music.  It was really easy to pair with my iPhone.  All I had to do was turn them on and find it in my phone, and there were ready to be used.  It has two buttons to control volume and also if you hold down + button for two seconds you can fast forward to the next song as well if you hold the - button you get to repeat a Song or hooks a little longer and to go to the previous one. I was able to use these right out of the box, I was surprised they were fully charged.  The charge last more than four hours, for me that’s enough.  I wish the loop that goes over the ear wasn’t so big, but then again I am very small and everything will always be too big for me.  I would buy again.
Edit: 7/24/19
Someone here said he had used them inside the pool and they were fine.  So.. I tried them and it didn’t work for me.  There was so much static and the pool is not even Olympic size.

While there were a few things that bothered me, I actually loved these headphones. They did the job, helped during bike rides and my daily home cleanups. I used them for music, school, workouts, phone calls and loved that I didn't have my headphones cord dangling for my son to grab out of my ears.
Then, they suddenly stopped working. I thought it was the battery so I charged them. After waiting for the light to turn blue, I tried to connect them to my phone and it would keep disconnecting saying the battery was low. Then one the right side stopped working. Now it won't charge, it won't connect, a earbud is dead. I took amazing care of them, kept them in their little case, charged every few days (I didn't use then heavily) and so on.
I'm not sure what happened. I want to get them again but I'm worried this will happen again.

It's my first pair. I was slow to change form being wired. The freedom is amazing. No more pulling on the ear. Also I am pleasantly surprised at the secure fit. I just kind of take it for granted that ear buds will never actually stay where u put them. I am not constantly fixing or pushing on these to be able to hear with a secure seal. Even when I'm using it as a single ear Bluetooth the seal remains strong and I don't notice any pulling sensation when the other bud is wrapped about my neck.
The blue blinky light is annoying as all hell in the dark but if u are very determined u can put electrical tape over it.
The headset talks to u so the light is only for a visual fixation.
This is important.... it can be paired with 2 devices at once.
That is important because I use it with my tab and phone simultaneously.
It reads an incoming call and tells u whether or not it's connected. Not sure yet if I can output pandora in the car and input phone calls. But we will see and I'll let u know.

I tried several wireless earphones...  5 different pairs.  Like everything else, it has its pros and cons... and I thought I'd share my own experience with the product here

Pros :
1.  I can run with this earphone on my ear and it would not fall off.  It is secured in its place and it would not move.  I had other earphones that kept falling off my ear while walking...  so compared to that, this earphone, especially with its over the ear hook design is a big plus.  I am not sure if I will ever buy an wireless earphone without the over the ear hook design.

2.  It does cancel out noise to a moderate extent.

3.  The customer service was great.  When I contacted them with the issue that I started experiencing, they were very responsive and sent me another pair as a replacement.  but the great things about this earphone pretty much end there.

Because of their great service, I really tried to like this earphone... and didn't want to write a bad review...  but ...  I decided that I would give it 2 stars due to the following reasons that I'm about to describe below.

Cons
1.  The biggest flaw of this earphone is that it keeps going blank every few seconds if the mp3 player moves around or if I put the player in my pocket.  It keeps losing the sound or the signal.  If I'm running on a treadmill where the mp3 player is sitting near by and I'm running... it plays fine.  However, if I run on the road where my mp3 player is moving back and forth in my grip or attached to my arm, the sound is keep getting cut off.  If I walk around while holding the mp3 player relatively steady at my elbow level... it would be somewhat ok...  but as soon as i put my hand down or place the mp3 player in my pocket or a bag behind me, it would lose sound again every few seconds.  It's just not listenable.  I tried other wireless (more expensive) headphone on the same mp3 player and tried the same thing and I had no sound issue.  I tried the earphone on other bluetooth devices and I am experiencing the same problem again.  I have tried few other devices switching back and forth to prove that it is the earphone issue, not my mp3 player issue.

The first earphone was fine for a month or two...  and I then started experiencing this issue.  After few weeks narrowing down the source of problem and debating what to do with it, I contacted the customer support.  They were very responsive and sent me another newer version of the earphone.  The second set was fine straight out of the box for a month... and then the same issue is happening again.

2.  The sound quality...  The ad promises ""superb bass sound""...  but to me... it is basically a muffle sound with not much treble...  the sound quality is just a bit better than a free earphone that get from an airplane.  I have older wireless Avantree earphone that I purchased at a similar price.  That sound quality is so much better than this earphone.  Another earphone that I tried, SoundPEATS Bluetooth Headphones, also has a better sound.

If I run on a treadmill and watch a movie with other earphones, I can hear the conversation quite well.  With this earphone, I have to guess what they are saying...  because it's so muffled out that it's hard to clearly hear the conversation.... even with the loud volume.  The sound is loud enough...  but it's just that it's not a clear sound.

I give 2 stars for their excellent service....  but I'm sorry to say that the earphone has failed me and I will be searching for another earphone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

However, the cord always bunches up around one of my shoulders instead of laying down my neck and it gets annoying. Good quality, though and easy to pair.

Update: Bluetooth now randomly disconnects from Bluetooth even though I've had it paired to my phone since I got them and it says it's paired.

PROS:  It was delivered on time with PRIM (2 days), Nicely packaged and all the accessories (including the 3 sets of earplugs), including a carrying case (for charger,instructions and spare ear buds etc) to store all the items neatly, the materials had the soft rubber feel of silicone for non slip and waterproof, the hook and plugs were comfortable and very light...Comfortable and Secure: I was assuming that the hook around the ear would be more rigid or plastic. ,its not. the hook around the ear is very soft and pliable .very comfortable yet secure...even if your a vulcan.

They're not super high quality sound, nor particularly pretty, but the sound is plenty good for listening to YouTube videos and non-audiophile music.  The battery lasts a whole day when they're fully charged and if you damage them through some act of supreme stupidity, they only cost twenty bucks to replace.  They're easy to pair with an iPhone or iPad and they come with various sizes of silicone ear baffles, so you can fit just about any size ears.  They come with this little, rubber slide to hold the earbud wires together so they don't fall out of your ears when you jog or bend over.  The identical design seems to be available on Amazon from a variety of sellers, each with some niche color variation or whatever, and they all cost about twenty bucks, so this must be a successful design from a seller's point of view.  I bought a second pair from this particular seller because I was completely satisfied with the last pair.

It also has a really awesome long range for Bluetooth connectivity. Sadly because of the affordability comes how short of a time you will have with this product. I bought it in January 2018 and now they are finally breaking on me. Not sure if it’s the wires or some piece in the earbud is broken. While I do like the affordability of this product, I would rather spend more money on something that will last longer than a year.

UPDATE: March 2018

After writing this review, I was contacted by their customer service. They had offered to send me a new pair of headphones. It took a while to receive them, but I do give them an A for effort and their courteous customer service. However, it got to such a hassle that I didn't even want them anymore.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Bought them to wear to the gym. Music quality is so-so, but is fine enough for the length of a workout. The bass is very good, however. I like the buttons on the side of the earpiece for easy song skipping and volume. The cord was a bit long so I just tried some off with a hair tie so is stays close to my neck and doesn't flop around when doing cardio. The bluetooth connectivity is easy, and the battery lasts approx 10 hrs when fully charged. There is a voice that plays when the battery is low, I believe at 5 and 10 minutes left. Overall I am happy with these.

I agree 100% with all of the other 5 star reviews for the same reasons, but I had to throw my support in the mix.  I work out 5-6 days a week.  I sweat ALOT.  I run, do burpies cardio and lift weights.  First these things never slip.
Second they are Water PROOF.  and heat resistant.  I wear them in the shower at the gym, and in the sauna, and the performance is flawless.  The sound is great, the highs and lows are great.  These are so awesome and inexpensive I ordered a second pair just in case the company stopped selling them.  I love the BEATS design, and they are way better than beats,  I bought 2 brand new pairs of Beats earbuds, and in NO time one of the ear phones stopped working( which I hate, once that happens the ear buds are useless to me and I get rid of them)  I bought a warranty for the BEATS threw amazon, and tried to use the warranty.  That was a huge waste of time.  I have had these earbuds for almost a year, and have put them threw workout hell, and both ear pieces work great and the sound and qulity has not dipped at all.  At the price if they only lasted a year I would still be ok.  These ear buds work better than the 100+ dollars I have spent on my BEATS..

Initially, I gave this product five stars and a glowing review. Sadly just two days after I wrote my review the left side of the earbud stopped working. I've had them less than a month and a half. So disapointed! Im now stuck with another earbud that stopped working and I can't return.

I've gone through dozens of headphones and earbuds over the years and... So far so good. I've had these for over a month and I love them. Great sound for both media and phone calls.

They even have a watertight, rubber cover that snaps into place over the charging port, when not charging.  These are so lightweight, my wife has already stolen them from me.  I shouldn't have told her that they could be easily paired to two different bluetooth devices without totally having to unpair the other, at the same time.  There is a multifuntion button, and volume up and down on the device, itself.  The cable that runs in between the two earpieces is a flat cable, which makes it harder to tangle and much easier to untangle even if they do get tangled, while in your backpack or purse.

They come with a few different exchangeable rubber earpieces to fit a variety of people's ears.  And it even comes with a hardened, zippered case that even has a carabiner for clipping the case to your belt during class, or when scaling K7!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have wanted a pair of Beats for a very long time but could not justify spending the $$ on them. I came across these earbuds on Amazon Prime Day and I am so glad I did. The ONLY difference between these and Beats is that these do not have the Beats logo/name. The sound quality is excellent and very clear. I use them while at work, about 8 hours a day. The charge will last all day and I can usually get a few hours the next day out of them before needing to recharge. They fit very comfortably in my ear and I love the clip that goes around my ear to keep them in place when I go running. I also love the fact that the controls are on the ear bud itself and not on a heavy ""remote"" hanging from the wire. I wish the wireless range was a little longer (I can walk about 20-30 feet away before they lose connection). I have only had them for about a month now so I can't comment on how long they last but they seem very durable so I expect to have them for quite some time.  I recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a good quality pair of earbuds without the hefty price tag.

****UPDATE****

I have now had these earbuds for 11 months. They have officially died after using them for 8+ hours a day. I am devastated and don’t know how I’m going to survive without them. :(","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Battery life so far seems exceedingly LONG, I have used mine and then tried to charge only to determine that it didn't need a charge yet!

The case fits EVERYTHING short of the instruction manual which you don't really need to reference because these are very user friendly.

They look nearly identical, have comparable functionality, but are a fraction of the cost, as new PowerBeats carry a tag of ~$150 (even re-furbished ones go for ~$100).

I was a very satisfied owner of the PowerBeats Wireless for >1 year before purchasing these Otium headphones. As such, my review of the Otium headphones is structured relative to the PowerBeats.

Pros:
—GREAT LOOK AND FEEL. These are good looking headphones and comfortable to wear. The ear pieces are much softer and more flexible than PowerBeats, which at times irritated my ear with prolonged use. The packaging is aesthetic and includes a nifty carrying case.
—EASY SETUP/CONNECT. The setup is quick and easy with your smartphone and has more than enough range to be used from your pocket, on the treadmill, etc.
—GOOD SOUND QUALITY. Obviously there is limited bass with in-ear buds, but the sound quality is good and indistinguishable from PowerBeats in my opinion.
—COST. This is CLEARLY the biggest pro, as these earphones are nearly identical to PowerBeats, but sell at >80% discount.

Cons:
—POWER ISSUES. I have only had the Otium headphones for ~1 week, but I have persistent issues powering them on/off. There is a power button on the right earpiece, but it takes me several minutes of pressing/tapping/holding down the power button to actually turn them on. This is not a problem I ever had with PowerBeats and is THE ONLY REASON I AM NOT GIVING 5 STARS. I am not sure if other people are having this issue, but I would like to think I am sufficiently tech-savvy that I am not just being ignorant trying to use them.

OVERALL: While these aren't high-end headphones, in my opinion they are a fantastic alternative athletic headphone to the pricey PowerBeats Wireless, with near-identical look, better comfort, and indistinguishable sound quality / range / battery life.

If Otium corrects my issues with the power button, I will absolutely revise my review with 5 stars. There is just no beating headphones of this quality and functionality at such a low price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The earphones are light weight, easy to use, and stay put while working out, or just working.
The sound quality is very good, they have a good amount of Bass, with out being overwhelming, the mids and highs are also good, although not as pronounced on some tracks, mostly a function of your phones music player I'd say, as I can adjust the sound to be comparable to my over ear headphones costing WAY more than these earphones. Between my tablet and phone the pairing took a couple tries, maybe my fault, but paired up okay.  And so far the battery life has been very good.  I haven't tried them until they are dead yet, but up to 4 hours they were good to go.

Not perfect, but excellent. The have very good sound quality (even after 4 months of VERY high volume use), background noise reduction and stay firmly in you ears even when working out and sweating. The earbuds have a pause button and volume control but no skip song options. The also have survived being put into jean pockets followed by physical activity and are just as structurally strong as the day they arrived. However, when the battery gets low, the earbuds pause whatever you are listening to and say ""Low Battery"". This would not be a problem except, there is perhaps a one thousandth of a second pause between what you are listen to and the low battery notification, which is said AT FULL VOLUME. There is NO WAY TO TURN IT DOWN either. The notification will be played at full volume regardless of what your phone volume is at or what volume the earbuds themselves are set at. So what will happen is your are laying in bed at night listening to some music on a nice low volume and without warning or pause your music will stop and the earbuds will scream ""LOW BATTERY!"" in your ears at full volume and scare you half to death. But if you keep them regularly charged this is not a problem. That flaw in the design of the earbuds is the ONLY thing keeping me from giving these earbuds a 5 star review. Overall I am very happy with these earbuds and how they have held up over time. excellent product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I am hard of hearing and have tried TV EARS ~ sent back even though the sound was amazing! The heaviness on my lower ear created so much discomfort...even using their ""loops"" to go over my ears didn't work nearly enough.
Next I tried the SIMOLIO ~ which was similar, but I had the same problem.  The SIMOLIO was incredible and yet painful, so back to Amazon they went...and then I found these little, light weight gems!!!  Easy to pair to Bluetooth, quick charge, SO COMFORTABLE I almost feel asleep with them on!  Not to mention the price!!!  For the $80.00ish dollars I sent on each of the other products, $20.00 was the ticket.  The only difference the $$$ reflects in the stethoscope models is the range ~ amazing long range hearing.

When I switch to iPhone it’s fixed. So I know it’s the headphones. That’s the only issue I have with them. I also have the issue where sometimes I get no audio as well. I think this is a major issue because I use the headphones to talk on the phone and listen to videos and if I’m not able to do hat well then the product isn’t worth a high rating.  I would give them a 1 star for that but there is one thing I actually love about them, the fact that my phone actually rings outside of the headset when I get a call. That is extremely useful because if I take off my headset and forgot to unpair my phone, I won’t miss a call. My last pair didn’t do that. But the last paid didn’t have the robot issue and no audio problem, too bad I lost those. I was going to buy them again but these had the exact same specs for about $8 cheaper and had good reviews so I gave it a shot. I think I’d like to return them now though, unfortunately because I don’t like to have to do returns. By the way no physical damage or water damage.

It may fail several times.

When it does finally connect, the connection is strong. I can walk from the first floor to the basement and it maintains connection without any static or interruption, unlike some competing products.

The sound space is very isolated, or closed, with these headphones. The earpiece gels seal your ear cavity to deliver sound. This can be good when you're in a noisy location, but dangerous if you are crossing the street as you may hear less of your surroundings.

The ear hooks are large. Far too large for my ears. They are hanging in the air above my ears, and the full weight of the devices is weighing in my ear canal on the earpiece gels. This device would be better if they gave a few ear hooks of different sizes that you could change -- or if it was made bendable so you could form it to your ear size and shape.

Audio quality, is poor. While the sub-bass may boom more than other headphones, low frequencies and bass audio is completely crushed. The same is true with treble and higher frequencies, they are crushed as well. Low beats and high notes are very low. The vibrancy of any music will be lost when using these. If you judge that audio quality is better with strong bass beats and hits only, then this may be ok for you.

Charging is difficult. There is a small rubber tab under the right device. This seems flimsy and will probably detach later. A better design would have been a plastic piece that pulls in and out to release strain. The charging usb cable they give is extremely short. It is a USB-micro-b connector. If you have a longer cable, you might be able to use that. The product manual states, you must only use a 5v 1a charger. An iPhone mini charger will work for this, but an iPad square charger may be too much. Using a stronger charger would only be ok if there was a limiter in the circuit design, but it is unknown if that is the case.

The cord is sort of uncomfortable to put around the back of your neck. The cord is not very flexible. I feel it brushing on the bottom of my shoulders and my neck. I prefer to let it hang in front of my chin actually. It looks ridiculous, but is more comfortable in my opinion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have to admit, I have small ears and I was hoping these would work for me since I have a hard time getting some headphones to stay comfortably. I got these to use as an extra pair when I'm charging my Beats studio 3's but unfortunately they wont work at all. They feel heavy in my ear, the part that's supposed to wrap around your ear for support doesn't even hand onto my ear. I had to jam the one side in and it felt so uncomfortable just to get it to stay on. There is a hard bulky plastic piece right behind the rubber insert that goes in your ear and it makes it nearly impossible to stay in because it won't allow the rubber piece to go in any further than where the plastic begins. I'm sadly disappointed and will be returning. If you have small ears or have a hard time fitting earphones in, I don't recommend even thought they sound great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Made sure to put it back in it's cool little case once done. The sound quality is great for the price and convenience, but there are some oddities or drawbacks to it. For one, the connection takes a while to establish. I've tried this product with 2 phones just to be sure, and it takes a solid 30-60 seconds to establish a connection to the headphones. There's also an issue with the battery. When I first received it, I discharged the battery completely like you're supposed to do with any battery powered item, and then fully recharged it. Took it to work with me the next day and everything was perfect, battery life was at 70% by the time I stopped using it. Thought that was pretty stellar since it was a total of 6 hours of usage. I went to use it the next day and the battery read 50%... thought that was odd, but ok, no biggie. I'd at least have several hours of listening time before it hit 0%. Wrong. Once the 30% mark rolled around, it keeps saying ""BATTERY LOW"" every minute, even when listening to something. As annoying as it was, I kept listening to my music, but after about 5 mins of ""BATTERY LOW"" the device shuts off. I turn it back on, and immediately get another alert, and it shuts off again. I look at the battery life expecting it to read 0% but it still reads 30%. I grabbed my other phone thinking it was getting a false positive percentage and that one also says 30%. After getting it home and recharging it that night, I tested the whole scenario out again, listened to music all day for a total of 7.5hrs. Same situation. 30% rolls around ""BATTERY LOW!"" and then shuts off.

Like I said, not a bad device by any means for the price, but you get what you pay for in every instance, so just make sure you keep in mind that a 30% battery life readout means next to nil.

EDIT: Since posting this, Otium has reached out to me and offered to replace my headphones. At this point, regardless of functionality, any company that is willing to do that after 2+ years with no warranty extension is good in my books. Hopefully the issue hasn't persisted past my original set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have bought several different headphones to try to find the best sound quality and these were perfect! The only thing is that my ears are a bit small so wearing them can become uncomfortable over prolonged use but they are pretty good for the price. The battery life is pretty good usually giving you about 7 hours until it notifies you that it needs charging. Another thing is, is that after two months they stopped charging and I was seriously disappointed because the sound quality is amazing and I didnt want to have to buy another and spend more money. I reached out to the company and asked for a replacement and they were very kind and helpful when responding to me saying that they will immediately send a new replacement free of charge. They delivered on that promise and I got a free replacement! Another thing to note is that I wouldn't charge these for more than 2 hours because the lithium battery can become overcharged and stop working as a result. I've seen many other similar headphones state this in there instructions manual not to do this. Also, something I did not catch when I was using this product was to not use a fast charger for it may cause unstable voltage and damage the battery. This is most likely the reason why my headphones stopped working but the company was nice enough to provide me a new one. So, 5 stars for customer service and support and 5 stars for the sound quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

-Adjustable eartips (THIS IS A BIG ONE!! As it's hard for me to find headphones that fits in my ears...)
-Wire is long enough to go around neck
-Sound quality is surprisingly very good! (maybe a bit less bass tho?)

BAD:-
-The battery life isn't as long as stated in the description, it says its around 8 hours when it lasts more for like 4.5-5 hours.
-The headphones dont stick, theyre pretty prone to falling out, especially if you run, they come out pretty easy.
-Earbuds are prone to getting extremely dirty, but this could be negated by doing a regular cleaning, however it affects sound quality if it goes under grill.

Second, and perhaps more important and relevant to normal consumers, the light.

Wells","Overall good but needs some improvement","February 25, 2018","Overall I am pleased with these headphones. The sound quality is good, I wasn’t expecting audiophile grade for this price but when driving or working out it’s just right. I don’t find myself needing to turn the volume up much more than half way to hear my music/movies/podcasts.
  The noise canceling ability is very good and someone talking to me from just a couple of feet away will be tuned out.
  As for comfort, anything that’s getting stuck in my ear will be noticeable after a while, however, unless I’m laughing a lot I can handle these for over 1.5 hours. I am not sure if they were designed to be worn in such a manner, but when I put these on I will rotate them backwards to feel more secure. This puts the ear hooks in a more conformed position with the back of my ear. These come with different sized ear pieces which is always nice and I figured they would. The hooks that go over your ear are flexible but they can’t be contoured into a different position that will stay that way.
  These have not fall out/off my ears, but they don’t feel 100% secure. I’ve tested with shaking my head around in an unnatural way  and they stay on. There’s just something about these that isn’t a perfect fit. However, as I stated they don’t fall off.
  As have been said in other reviews when the battery is getting low, roughly 30 minutes left, there is an automated voice saying “battery is low.” Yes it is annoying and they probably could have done it better but it’s not a complete deal breaker. On a full charge I get roughly 7.5 hours of play time.
  These are not fully hands free. There is a function to redial the last number called. Voice dialing or accessing Siri with these is not an option. I’ve even tried to use my Apple Watch to acess siri to make a call but if the headphones are on, it won’t work. It will answer a call if you push the power button and hang up if pushed again. I still swipe my phone to answer a call and it prompts my iPhone to switch to the built in speakers of the phone, however with an iPhone it’s a simple matter to switch back to the headphones. During one call I had one ear piece out and the person on the other line started to hear the ambient noise around me and was having trouble hearing me.  Syncing to my phone was not a problem.
  I would probably try a different headphone style after these die just to find a better fit, but would keep these in the back of my mind since I’ve been fairly content with these, despite the limited hands free abilities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

The volume buttons were backwards of what I expected, but I got used to that really fast.  Everything seems reasonably sturdy and the case they came with was handy.

It came fully charged and worked with no problem right from the start, sound quality is surprisingly good. 2 days later and it was the first time I was just trying them out walking round the house and the sound started cutting out, a simple re-syncing and it start working fine again. For the past month it was alright I wasn't using the headphones on a daily basis only on the weekends for roughly 1-2 hours, but for the past couple times I have used them the same cutting audio issue started up again and this time only when I was running. This past weekend it was so bad I just stopped using them altogether, no matter how many time I re-synced the headphones after just moving around it the sound would cut off.  Not really happy with this purchase and going forward I may have to rethink ever buying anything for this company, which is sad because these are well designed headphones that stay in the ear when you exercise and when it worked sounded great.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Even then sometimes it would be spotty with my mac on my lap while wearing them (I know headphones with a cord would reach but I got lazy okay). I wore them while cleaning around my room and whenever it was outside the few feet boundary and I was facing away the audio became spotty at best, until I got closer. I haven't tried running with them yet but I like how they stay in place. For cheap headphones I can't really complain but I wish the audio range was better.

Update:
It's been a while now since I started using these headphones. After I left this last review I was contacted immediately about any possible issues I'd had, and I appreciate the fast response and customer care there. I realized after a while of usage that it's only my Mac that has issues with them (I own a 2012/2013 Macbook Pro) but my iPhone 6 is totally fine. In my own room my Mac will have sound disturbances and pauses frequently, but with my phone I walked across the gym and back without a single interruption.

These are heavy with bass but this problem can be adjusted via EQ settings in your music app of choice. The reason this was given 2-stars was that they die at 30% battery (as seen from the indicator on notification screen). I've charged them numerous times and depleted them and the same thing happens, that it will die at 30% but to test a quick charge of 15-mins, they turn back on with 70%.

Confident especially about the sound quality. Once I received them, charged them and tried them I was extremely disappointed. The sound is Flat to say the least. It's like a monotone.... That is the best description I can write without going into many details. Imagine listening to something where everything sounds flat.

I tested out the songs with other Bluetooth and plug-in earbuds, so I'm positive it's not the songs. Sadly it is the earbuds.  The design and comfort level are good, did want to mention that.

Returning these.
------------------------------------
After this review I was contacted by customer support and was offered a new set of earbuds and apologized for the issue I had with the ones I purchased.  Upon arrival of the new earbuds I decided to test them out and right out of the box the sound was noticeable better, like increasingly noticeable better.  I have used these for 2 weeks not and I can say that for the price you pay the sound and the quality of the product is a good investment.  I heard some issues about the range of the earbuds away from the source (my cell phone) and I can say that before it started flickering or I even notice I had left my phone at the desk, I was more than 90 - 100 feet away from the source.  (More than the distance from home plate to first base for reference).

I would recommend this product if you want good earbuds, and want to still pay a reasonable price and am upgrading my review and rating.  Thanks to the customer service department for reaching out and try to solve the issue and create happy customers.

  I remember seeing reviews about the headset falling off or earbuds not staying in, but I've never had that problem. I  listen to a lot of audiobooks and podcasts, so I wear these almost every day while working, excercising, driving, whatever. I've worn them in the shower a few times, but water can get inside of the earbud and you can't hear much until it's dry. All things considered it's a great headset and I'm considering buying another.
  I've had these for 8 months now, and I've really enjoyed them. I came back because my 1yo son got a hold of them and the right earbud is cutting out now. I've never had issues with the signal or audio cutting out before, so he probably pulled a wire loose.

I usually could use my Magicbuds for a whole day or two without losing battery. I barely used this pair throughout the day and they died befor my walk home. Additionally, they seem to be buggy in that when I turn them on, they immediately turn back on. Only like the 5th time I try to turn them on do they actually work and connect to my phone.

But these - BETTER than I expected! VERY pleased. Definitely worth the money. All of these types of 'phones say they have ""amazing bass"" - including these - but let's face it, no small earphone has *amazing* bass. BUT - given the limits of physics, this one does a great job! The sound is good provided you get the bud to seal inside the ear. These are the first of this type where the inserted bud part actually fits my ear (using the largest earbud tip). The BEST part (at least for me)??? The lady that talks to you when you successfully pair your device has a British accent! She says ""You're headset is connected"" and ""You're headset is disconnected"" which I love. Funny how it's the small things. Only issue I've had is with charging, as with many electronics, just because the USB cable fits doesn't mean it properly charges your device. Problem solved if you just use the cable it comes with. Oh and as for battery life - seems pretty long. I've never had to worry about recharging them. I went to sleep with them on listening to white noise for several hours then woke up to go to the gym and noted they still had 90% battery left. As for pairing, I don't think that's much of an issue (remember the old days when things would NEVER pair!) but these seem to pair easier and quicker than my previous bluetooth 'phones, which were all Skullcandy.

The functionality was similar and the price was 1/3rd if what I was willing to pay so I figured why not.

First thing first, you get what you pay for. You can't expect  $100 quality from a $20 product. The headphones work as advertised and come ready to use straight out of the box. The function keys seem like they're backwards to me the volume + key is behind your ear love and it takes some effort to push.

The battery on these things is decent to say the least however 3 major complaints.

1. There is no way to check the power level on the battery
2. The battery discharges at the same rate regardless of weather it's on standby or powered off.
3. The headphones make and audible sound every few seconds once the battery is below 30% making them virtually unusable at that point.

Sound quality is just ok compared to a wired/jacked-in headphone, but I think that's just a limitation of the Bluetooth codec.  As others have mentioned, the controls are ""backwards"".  When you're wearing the headphones, you'd think the rearmost button would decrease volume and go to previous track (and vice versa for the forward button), but it's the opposite.  You get used to it, but it's a bit odd.  Also, its self-reporting (""power on"", ""connected"", ""powering off"", etc audio notifications) volume is very LOUD and does not seem adjustable (ignores the volume settings for music playback), but you can just turn it on/off when it's not in your ear.

My college age grand sons were disappointed AT FIRST because these were not Bose or Beatz. But they immediately used them and were totally impressed with the sound quality, appearance, fit and features. I read all reviews on many, many different ear phones and was skeptical of these due to the low price. I took a chance on all the good reviews and figured if they turned out to be not so good, then I didn't lose much money and would go ahead and buy them the ones they wanted. My young men were totally happy with quality and I saved a ton of money! I did not personally try them out. But by the reaction of my grandsons being pleasantly surprised by the clarity and bass response I'm happy I decided to buy these. Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof In Ear Earbuds for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

They were working out fine until then. You think I would have learned since this is my 3rd or 4th pair of off brand name devices that have died on me. I can see why Amazon takes away the ""Return Item"" link on these after like 3 months and also, why take the time and hassle to get in touch with customer service in China. Almost not worth the time. They know. I finally just had to bite the bullet and buy some name brand devices at Costco. At least if those die I can return them easily enough. We shall see, maybe it is just me. They all say sweat proof but I really think my sweat is seeping in the seems causing the damage to the electronics which means NOT sweat proof. Or it could just be crap electronics that only last a short time. Either way save your time and just go with a brand name pair for about $60.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

These are really great headphones, especially for the price. The only reason it's getting 4/5 rather than 5/5 is because it took me about 25 minutes of trying and failing to pair it to my phone. I'm usually quite tech savvy, I can get stuff to work almost every time without reading the manual, but for this one I read the little booklet front to back twice over and still had issues, it was basically refusing to pair to my phone, which is a pain. but after running the pairing cycle a fair few times, it finally paired and I couldn't be happier with them. I'll update my review with an estimation of the battery life in the near future, that may sway the star rating up to a 5 or down to a 3, because charging my headphones every day seems like a big hassle, but if the battery is good, it may compensate for the pairing debacle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have been using these while I skateboard and mountain bike. They are very comfortable. I have worn them for long peroids and my ears were not sore at all after my use. I like how many replacement rubber ear pieces come with them. I know that I will never go through them all.  It is great having them be a wireless while. I had a pair of the beats earphone that looks just like these but they are $299. I work in the audio engineering field, and I would say these have better frequency range meaning they sound better than the beats brand earphones that these seem to be modeled after. They are less money than the beats, but they actually reproduce sound better than higher priced Beats Brand earphone. These are better BEATS brand earphones that these look like!!!

I've been impressed with these given the price.  The material quality is quite good (better than other cheap in-ear headphones I've tried), and they've lasted well, even with how much I sweat on those bike machines.

The sound quality isn't fantastic, but is reasonable for the price.  I'm a bit of an audiophile, so I would never choose these for serious listening, but that's not what I bought them for.  I would also never use expensive headphones for a workout.

The only functional complaint I have about them is a minor one:  the volume rocker is backwards compared to what I would think of as ""normal,"" at least in Western/U.S. cultures.  When they're on your ear, increasing volume is on the back of the rocker switch, while reducing loudness is on the front of the switch.  Not a big deal, and you get used to it.

Overall, a big thumbs up if you're looking for inexpensive headphones.  If you want good sound quality for music and you're not going to ruin your headphones with sweat, spend $50+ and get something that sounds better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I have a couple pairs of true wireless headphones but I just did not like them because the battery was ridiculously low and they kept falling out--among a number of other reasons. I'm happy to be back to wireless headphones with the connector wire in the back. I can string them over my neck when I pop them out to talk to someone, they're a lot harder to lose, and the battery lasts waaaay longer.

Anyway, specifically about these headphones--the battery lasts nice and long. In fact it hasn't run out on me yet and I am a VERY HEAVY music listener. I listen to music more hours than I don't during the day. I haven't yet tried to completely run them down but the fact that I haven't needed to says something. They are very nice and loud which is great for destroyed-from-too-much-loud-music ears like mine. The headphones fit nice and snug, and they have the ear hooks. I don't like ear hooks, and every other pair I've had I've been able to pop them out, so that's the only thing I don't like. They pair easily as long as you follow directions, and they don't come unpaired. They're easy to use. The three buttons on the right side phone have a lot of button combos you can use.

Overall these are great! You should definitely buy. They even come with a nice carrying case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

I was able to tune out noises on the plane, focus in on my workout at the gym, and reduce the wires at my desk at work.

Music:
I'm not a huge music person, but I listen to music while doing various tasks that require focus and these have very good bass and treble for the price. The annoying hissing noise you get from some headsets when you have no audio playing is non-existent here.

Noise cancelling: I've never had a more enjoyable airport/plane experience until I bought these. No crying babies, no annoying conversations, just peace. Initially at work, I nearly missed an phone call or 2 had I not seen my phone lighting up.

Range: I've had good bluetooth headsets that I couldn't even walk 30ft to the opposite side of my apartment without the recipient telling me the dreaded ""You're breaking up..."". These I'm able to charge my phone on one end while walking around doing other various tasks without a single drop in music or call quality.

Mic/Call Quality:
Good, but I don't primarily use these to talk on the phone with. I prefer a dedicated headset for that purpose, but these get the job done so that's definitely a plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"

Battery has lasted four days without recharging. I use them to listen to music at the gym and I work out for about an hour each day. The headphones are light weight and very comfortable. I did receive a call on them, the sound is clear and I did not get any complains from the caller about the sound quality.  What I like the most about them is that the microphone is located on the ear piece so there is nothing that weights down on the cable behind my neck or below the ear. The headsets include different size buds for the ear and they usually stain in place.

Cons: It would be nice if they included different size hooks for the ear, sometimes they do feel slightly loose but for the most part they stay in place when lifting weights, they only fall out when doing bench press. I think that different size clips are not included becasue they are not removable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Otium-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/product-reviews/B018APC4LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=helpful"
