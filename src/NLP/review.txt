This headphone set has poor sound quality: it lacks midrange, and attempts to compensate by boosting treble and bass, but in a bad way. Mids are still scooped & music sounds poor & cheap.
The hissing white noise is intolerable, unless you like white noise then these are perfect for your youtube noise videos.

I tested these with (remastered) Led Zeppelin, Physical Graffiti, and Hillsong United, Zion. I would've also tested with Maxim Vengerov or a Rachmaninov concerto but didn't bother after listening to two albums.

I'm not an expert but I am a musician with sound engineer experience.
